A.1:  #Now are we off and running?#

@B.2:  #that you were saying.#  Sorry.

A.3:  Oh, I was just saying I guess old age has a few compensations.  I don't
have to plan as carefully as I used to, but, uh,

B.4:  Do you feel like you, you took the steps that you, you were glad that you
took, um, earlier, I mean, would you have done anything differently?

A.5:  No, I don't think so.  Uh, we have three children, and we were able to put
all three of them through college, and, um.

B.6:  That's, that's quite a feat in today's [laughter], 

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  economic situation.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  That's wonderful.  Um, I'm sort of beginning in that score.  Um, we have a
two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon, so.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  It's, it's not easy putting enough aside, but we're doing a, um, our best
to try and have fairly regular meetings to discuss at least where our goals
are.  Sometimes, um, it is less consistent than it could be in terms of our
ability to put money aside.  But, um, I'm, I'm curious about the things that
you did that, that seemed to work best for you that you'd pass on to somebody
else [laughter] --

A.13:  Uh.

B.14:  -- as advice.

A.15:  Well, the only way, if you spend all you take in every month, you're, uh,
living beyond your means.

B.16:  That's right [laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter] And emergencies, or what we could, would consider an emergency,
uh, always come up.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  I, I, I don't care how, how you, how closely you think you figured and then
planned, something always comes up.  So, uh, when, I, I guess we started by
necessity, because we went to, uh, law school on my husband's G I Bill --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- back in the days when, uh, the government paid the student's tuition
and, and bought books up to a certain amount, plus gave the veteran a stipend.
We started off with ninety dollars a month, and then a little bit later got up
to a hundred and five dollars a month.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  So there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly
stipend --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope, deciding it was better
to without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month.

B.26:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.27:  And, then, uh, later on, [throat_clearing] when we got out of school, my
husband got recalled into the Air Force when the Korean mess came up, and, uh,
so we had already established the envelope habit, and, uh.

B.28:  And the envelope was your savings?

A.29:  No, no, no.  This was our weekly budget.

B.30:  Oh, okay.

A.31:  But, uh, we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to
buy cars and that sort of thing, that we would have to save up beforehand.

B.32:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.33:  So, uh, we, uh, uh, began, uh, in nineteen fifty, uh, to pay cash for
everything.  We bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three
months.  So since then, except for a house, houses, we've paid cash for
everything.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  And, uh, to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity
to take care of special pricing, uh, our headquarters was transferred from
South Carolina to Texas one time, and because Texas gas was much, much cheaper
to cook with than electricity, this one couple that we were transferred with,
uh, bought a gas stove, a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty
some odd dollars.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  We had, uh, in storage, and used, uh, just a little teeny gas stove, but
after we got to Waco, we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had,
uh, was moving into a house with a built in oven had the very best stove that
Sears made at the time, with two ovens, a grill in the middle on top, clock,
all the fancy amenities --

B.38:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars, because we had the
cash.

B.40:  Yes, yeah.

A.41:  And, uh, uh.

B.42:  That's, that's been the case for us with, with, uh, cars, and our
preference recently has been used cars, so it's been --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- nice to be able to negotiate when you have cash when you're buying a
car.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  Well, that's a, that's a, an important lesson.  Do you feel like you've
passed that along to your three kids, given how different the economy's been
in their lives?

A.47:  No, unfortunately we have not, except for one daughter-in-law, and, uh,
[laughter], 

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  rise up and call her blessed every day.  Uh, for some reason or other,
my husband didn't see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance.  He just
felt he had to keep control of the purse strings.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And, uh, when they went off to college they had never really budgeted --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and, uh, that, that was a big mistake.  So even though you know your
children are going to make mistakes, uh, and I don't know how to tell you,
