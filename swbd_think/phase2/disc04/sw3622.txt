========================================================================

A.1:  kind of pets you got?

@B.2:  Well, we got two Cocker Spaniels at the house, uh, a female and a, and a
male, and at the office I have tropical fish.  How about yourself?

A.3:  Fish in the office.  May dad used to have fish in his office, years ago.
We've got three cats.

B.4:  Meow, meow cats?

A.5:  Meow, meow cats.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  That's, that's exactly what they do, we got, we've got, um, one that's
about three and a half and he's black and white, and one that's three, and
she's all white, although she's a little dirty now, and then we got one that's
a year old, and is what they call tor-, tortoise hair, which is kind of multi,
multicolored, and, um, she's the one that's most vocal, I think.

B.8:  My sister and her husband had cat, and it was kind of an alley cat, and it
kept going out in the alley and getting pregnant, and it looked kind of like a
Persian cat, but anyway, went and got pregnant the first time, they advertised
in the newspaper free kittens, and, and nobody would come over and do
anything.  And then they changed to ad to read, Persian like kittens,
thirty-five dollars, and they were gone in one day [laughter].

A.9:  Free market, it worked.  Well, all our cats have been, uh, have been
neutered or spayed or what have you.  Our white cat has got some Persian like
qualities and big and it's, and it's very long haired, which makes it look
even bigger.  The other two are short haired cats.

B.10:  We let our female, uh, get pregnant, as a matter of fact it's A K C so we
reached out for a stud, and when the, the, uh, puppies arrived we made sure
the children were there to see it.  Uh, we thought it was a very simple, uh,
course in birth, [laughter] birds and the bees.  And, uh, the dog has had two
litters, and I'm glad the children experienced the process.  Uh, I didn't see
anything wrong with it.

A.11:  As I said, we're, we're not going to end up with any kittens, we figured,
we had two other cats before these, both of, one of which died from old age.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  It was about, um, fourteen and a half, and then one died very young from
feline leukemia, years ago when they didn't, you know, now they've got shots
for feline leukemia, but back when this cat died, which was, oh, some ten
years ago, they didn't have feline leukemia shots, so, it got ill, then it got
better, and then it got ill and died immediately.

B.14:  Huh.

A.15:  So.

B.16:  Well, we nearly lost a dog, the second time she had a litter we didn't get
her on vitamins soon enough, and some distressed children, the dog was just,
the hindquarters wouldn't work, so we ran to the vet one Sunday morning,
believe it or not they've got twenty-four hour vets in emergency clinics, and,
they, they charge like that too, and, uh, he said well, there's three things.
He said well, that's not it, the second one, that's not, by the second "that's
not" the kid's were in the lobby just crying their heads off, and the third
one got corrected the dog, and we saved the dog, thank goodness, it just, it
didn't have the right vitamins to keep it going, with the puppies draining her
milk.

A.17:  Oh, my.

B.18:  So, we enjoy dogs because, uh, they kind of bark when someone shouldn't be
around the house.  We do not let them in the house at all, but they're outside
dogs, and, uh, what are your cats, do they, uh, meow at all if some stranger
comes?

A.19:  Well, I don't think so, but they're inside, um, part of the time, outside
part of the time.  And, um, oh, I don't know, they, uh, well, they're not
watch cats or anything, but I tell you what, we don't have any mice or, 

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  or any, uh, rodents or anything like that.  They, they certainly keep
things, uh, neat and clean.  Things stay away.

B.22:  Do, do, do they actually kill mice?

A.23:  Uh, well, one time we know we've had cats that have killed mice.  Most of
time unfortunately they end up killing birds --

B.24:  Ooh.

A.25:  -- and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step,

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  and there'll be a bird missing a head or, you know, whatever, but, uh,
we got in at least once I saw one of the cats, not this cat but one of them
that's now died that, that had a, had a mouse, and one time one of the cats
got a, a rabbit that was in the backyard.

B.28:  Killed it?

A.29:  No, uh, we got it to let go the rabbit.  We heard this horrible shrill
noise and didn't know what it was, and it was a rabbit screaming (( )), and we
went out there and convinced the cat to let go of the rabbit.

B.30:  Well, we've got a pet rabbit in the house, I forgot to mention that, and,
uh, when we've been having a fence put in, the dog got to the rabbit, and it
was no longer a live rabbit.

A.31:  Oh, my, well, I, we went over to a friend's house, they had a pet rabbit,
and this pet rabbit looks just like our white cat.  We always called the white
cat a big rabbit, and the fact of it, the cat and the rabbit looked pretty
similar [laughter].

B.32:  Have you heard about people that house train their rabbits?

A.33:  These people had their rabbits outside.

B.34:  Well, this is, our, we do too.  It's in a cage, but peo-,
