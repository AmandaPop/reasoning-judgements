=====================================================================

A.1:  interesting political development of the year and everything that's been
happening in the former Soviet Union with the break up and the reconstitution.

B.2:  Yeah, I agree.  I been, interesting to see how Gorbachev has, uh, been
releasing the power to Yeltsen, including, including the, uh, button for the
nuclear arsenals.

A.3:  Well, you've got to wonder what really happened in the so-called August
coup, who really planned that thing out, who split the benefit.

B.4:  Yes, uh, I agree, it's, uh, that's some things that nobody may ever know
for sure.

A.5:  Oh, well, I suspect that Mister Yeltsen probably knows a lot more about it
than he's ever let on.

B.6:  Yeah, he may, but it'll be interesting to see how this sort of loose
commonwealth, uh, works --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- from the standpoint of, uh, being as one political entity or whether
it's really just going to be kind of a loose confederation.

A.9:  Of course there's always the problem of the twelfth republic, Georgia,
that's in a civil war right now, what happens with them.

B.10:  Also, uh, did, uh, did those Baltic States, did Astonia and Latvia, et
cetera, did they --

A.11:  No they.

B.12:  -- did they pitch their lot in with them or,

A.13:  No, they, they went, all three of those, Latvia, Astonia, and Lithuania,
went completely independent, and had nothing to do with the commonwealth of
states.  So they each, three separate republics, although I think the three of
them have gone in together in some sort of confederation while they each are,
are supposedly independent.

B.14:  It may be interesting to see how, when they start talking about border
defense, whether they're going to, I think most of those independent countries
are going to decide that they want to defend their own borders.

A.15:  Well, then what happens in the U N?  Russia supposedly gets the Soviet
Union's seat, and what happens with the eleven other republics.  I guess they
don't get anything?  Who knows.

B.16:  Well, I think the, what Russia's going to bid for is the seat on the
Security Council, but I suppose that all of the other eleven can, or the ten
others, or however many there are, can be admitted as regular members of the U
N.

A.17:  I don't know if these are really independent countries, or like states in
the United States.  It almost looks likes, some ways like the old Confederate
States of America, is almost what this arrangement looks like.

B.18:  Yeah, could be, it could be.

A.19:  You've got, uh, eleven or twelve basically quote independent republics
which are in a confederation.  Does look a lot, you know, I think if we went
back and looked at Civil War documents, it'd be a similar arrangement to the
Confederate States of America.

B.20:  Yeah, could be, could be.  Although, they, a lot of those existed as states
prior to, uh, to their being a Soviet Union, so, I, I don't know.

A.21:  Well, you have to look back to the great expansion of Peter the Great
followed by Catherine the Great, uh, which pretty well set the course for what
then became the Soviet Union.  I mean it has its roots back there in the, in
the early seventeen hundreds.

B.22:  [Lipsmack] Yeah, that's true.  I don't know what, uh, currency things are
going to be done, too, whether each one will have to completely establish a
currency based on whatever system or whether they can rely on the ruble
somehow, and, uh (( )).

A.23:  I think one person put it aptly, the ruble is rubbish.  

B.24:  Well, that's true, probably for any of them.

A.25:  Of course, then the problem is what they do with their nuclear weapons.
That's a more interesting problem.

B.26:  Well, there's only four states that have any, though.  Only the Ukraine and
Belorussia and Russia themselves, and then that one middle Asian, the one
that starts with a K.  Konespan or something, whatever that is.  Uh, they're
the only four, and two of the four have said they would like to destroy them.
It's only that fourth one that worries me a little bit, but they don't have
any intercontinental ballistic missiles down there, either.  They have short
range nuclear capability and presumably not very many of them, judging by
where that is.

A.27:  Well, who knows what they're going to do (( )).

B.28:  Russia had ninety percent of them, on Russian soil, so they're still going
to control the, by and large the large amount of those.

A.29:  Well, of course the question is, what Gorbachev does.  I guess he goes and
writes his memoirs or something.

B.30:  He's been offered a position in the United States in Colorado to teach
[laughter].

A.31:  I think he's turned that down though.

B.32:  Yeah, I imagine he would, because he'd have to move over here, lock, stock
and barrel, and he's still got children and grandchildren there in, in Russia,
so.

A.33:  Well, I don't think he, I don't think he wants to do that, but he, he
certainly would be like an elder statesman or whatever.  Well he could
certainly give lectures around the world if he wanted to do that on an
informal basis.  He could also, uh, like you say, write a book, probably be a
best seller [laughter].

B.34:  Or How I Survived the August Coup, But Really Didn't Survive It.

A.35:  Yeah, well, it's all been an outgrowth of what he started.  He started,
