=========================================================================

A.1:  You say you taught school for a while?

B.2:  Yes.  It's been some years ago.  I haven't taught in the last twenty years.

A.3:  Oh.  What grades did you teach?

B.4:  I taught about half the time at the high school level and about half the
time at, uh, junior college level.

A.5:  Okay.  Uh, and what general subjects?

B.6:  Uh, business subjects.

A.7:  Okay, okay.

B.8:  Do you have children in school?

A.9:  Uh, not yet.  Uh, my first son is, uh, about two months old now.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  You know, but I'm presently going to college.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Um, do you see anything in particular, do you see, you feel is wrong about
the school system, the way it's running now?

B.14:  Uh [breathing] well, other than the fact that it, it's not difficult enough
and it doesn't last long enough during the school year.  Uh, I think one of
the, the big errors, uh, that was made over the years is passing children
along when they hadn't really completed the ga-, grade that they were in.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  And allowing children to graduate from high school who couldn't read and
write.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  And cipher #[laughter].#

A.19:  #[Laughter] Yes.#

B.20:  Uh, when I taught at the, uh, junior college level, uh, I taught, uh,
business law #at the# --

A.21:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

B.22:  -- sophomore level and #we were# --

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  -- on the quarter system, so they had, this was the last two quarters in
the sophomore year, so they had to think up something for me to teach at the,
uh, front end of the, in the fall.

A.25:  Yes.

B.26:  So I taught a little course called office machines.  Now, keep in mind,
this was long before the days of the hand held computer.

A.27:  Yes.

B.28:  Calculator.  So we started off with a ten key adding machine.

A.29:  Uh-huh. 

B.30:  And, uh, one of the first problems was to add three-tenths and twenty-four
hundredths, and invariably a substantial proportion of the class would come up
with twenty-seven hundredths, so I would have to launch into a discussion of
common denominator and #explain# --

A.31:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

B.32:  -- that every figure that was entered into that ten key adding machine with
two decimal places was a number divided by a hundred.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And in order to add three-tenths to anything, it had to be changed to
thirty hundredths.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  And, uh, the only criterion for getting into the junior college where I
taught was being eighteen years of age.  Uh, having a high school diploma was
not a prerequisite.  It was for some of the [breathing] the curricula, but it
#wasn't# --

A.37:  #Yes.#

B.38:  -- for the business curriculum.

A.39:  Huh.

B.40:  So #[laughter],#

A.41:  #Not even a# G E D was required?

B.42:  I beg your pardon?

A.43:  A G E D wasn't even required, or was that available yet?

B.44:  Uh, no, it, it was not at that time, uh, to take courses, or it had to be
with eighteen years of age.

A.45:  Huh.

B.46:  Uh, so, uh, the, the new math, I think ruined our math.  Uh, I was teaching
at the high school level when it was being introduced to the seventh grade and
eighth grade, and, uh, I went to a lecture and the math teacher said well, we
used to teach business arithmetic at the seventh and eighth grade level, but
now we're going to teach the new math, like how to, to count in the binary
counting system.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  And, uh, uh, the base twelve and --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- that sort of thing.

A.51:  Yes.

B.52:  And, uh, we're going to teach the theory of mathematics, and never mind
percentage, so #uh, I checked my, my# --

A.53:  #Huh.  So (( )) teach a concept.#

B.54:  -- my son was, uh, let's see, when would he have been in eighth grade?
About, oh, in the middle sixties he would have been in the eighth grade, and I
checked his eighth grade math book, and, uh, there were no perc-, were was two
pages devoted to percentage and ratio and proportion.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And in, in his algebra book there were no fractions, no percentages.  And,
of course, he proceeded on to geometry and, uh, that sort of thing.
Fortunately, my boys have a very high aptitude in math [breathing].

A.57:  Yes.

B.58:  But, uh, there's a, a, a great population out there that does not, and, uh,
so I went through this, uh, lecture of counting in the decimal counting
system, and I said if this doesn't make sense to you, memorize it [laughter].

A.59:  [Breathing].

B.60:  Learn your ((tutoms)) [laughter].

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  Because it's a percentage world out there.

A.63:  Oh, yeah.  Yes.
