A.1:  What are your favorite shows?

B.2:  Well, [laughter] I, it's doesn't seem like I get enough time to watch much
T V, but --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- the ones that are out now.  I, I've watched that SISTERS a couple of
times.  I think that's kind of a good show.

A.5:  I've never seen that.

B.6:  Haven't you?

A.7:  Huh-uh.

B.8:  Oh.  I like that one, and, um, (( )) I'm trying to think.  I, I don't even
know if I have any other real regular ones that I watch.

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  How about you?

A.11:  Um, I like L A LAW --

B.12:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.13:  -- not because it's realistic, but [laughter] it's entertaining.

B.14:  I do like that.  

A.15:  Um.

B.16:  Yeah, occasionally I'll see that one.

A.17:  Let's see.  I watch CHEERS sometimes.

B.18:  Do you?

A.19:  And, mostly just movies, when there's a good movie on.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Actually when there isn't a good movie on, too.

B.22:  Oh.

A.23:  I just like to have the T V on if, you know, if I'm home alone or 
something --

B.24:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.25:  -- have, either the radio or the T V -s got to be on [laughter],

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  the whole time.

B.28:  Yeah, uh, oh, I do, I kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately.

A.29:  Oh, really.

B.30:  I've, well, I've been home with a, um, I have a baby, and --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and so I've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much, and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- so I'll, I'll watch a soap occasionally.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  Do you watch any of those?

A.37:  I, well, I don't, because I work all day.  

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  But, um, I pro-, I usually do if I'm home for a couple of days, like, you
know, around Christmas or whatever, after a while I'll start watching it --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and then on, for a while I'll ask people if they know what happened --

B.42:  Oh --

A.43:  -- and then I'll just forget it.

B.44:  -- what, what ones do you get into?

A.45:  Uh, I don't even remember the last time I watched was back in college.  It
was like GENERAL HOSPITAL or something --

B.46:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and I maybe watched it for a week --

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  -- but, um, I know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around
the, you know, they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap
opera.

B.50:  How funny, oh, yeah.

A.51:  It was a,

B.52:  Oh, I don't get into them that much.

A.53:  [Laughter].

B.54:  When I'm home, sometimes in the day I'll --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- I'll watch them --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- but, yeah, oh, I was really trying to think.  I don't even know if
there's any other shows that I watch or else.

A.59:  Well, you said you have kids.  How old?

B.60:  Oh, I have a six year old, and I have a, um, he'll be a year old in
January.

A.61:  So, you're, you aren't a SESAME STREET fan?

B.62:  Well, 

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  they do, they watch it.  My six year old's kind of, he's outgrown that
one a little bit, but --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- but, I've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby, and he's kind
of, he's entertained by it.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  So, yes, I, I do watch that one.

A.69:  Supposed to be a great babysitter [laughter].

B.70:  Yeah, well, they're not entertained for too long with it.  He's, 

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  he's still too little, but --

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- yeah, I do turn that on.  

A.75:  Um.

B.76:  And I, I do like, um, DONAHUE.

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  Sometimes I watch that.  I think he has some interesting things on it.

A.79:  I know, what time is that on, I never see it?

B.80:  Um, that's on at, let's see, it's on at four.

A.81:  Oh, okay.  I'm not home then, that's why I don't see it.

B.82:  Yeah, I'll watch that occasionally.  He's got some real, I don't know,
there's some real weird people that, 

A.83:  [Laughter].

B.84:  he seems to come up with.

A.85:  Isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think
are strange [laughter]?

B.86:  Yes.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  (( )).  He does have some real bizarre things, I
think.

A.87:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.88:  So, other than that, I don't know.

A.89:  What's that?

@@B.90:  Guess I'm not much of a T V person really.

A.91:  Yeah, well, I guess it wasn't a real good topic for us, but [laughter].
Well, tell me, is it snowing up there?

B.92:  Um, no.

A.93:  No.

B.94:  It snowed a little bit, um, probably about four days ago --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas.

A.97:  Wow.  But do you have snow on the ground now?

B.98:  Yeah --

A.99:  Oh.

B.100:  -- there is snow on the ground.

A.101:  Well, that's nice.

B.102:  I, I wish it would snow a little bit more.  I've heard it's raining there.

A.103:  Oh, gosh, we've broken all sorts of records.

B.104:  Oh really.

A.105:  They've got, I mean, we still have some highways closed, and it stopped
raining almost twenty-four hours ago.

B.106:  Oh, my goodness.

A.107:  But, um, oh, just phenomenal, I mean, I, you know, you see it on the news
all the time, but until you've really seen it, it does-, it doesn't really hit
you.

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  But I was driving home from work Friday, and I saw, there were some stop
signs, I mean, submerged up to the writing on the stop sign, and that was 
just --

B.110:  Oh, goodness.

A.111:  -- it was amazing to me.

B.112:  Oh, gee so.

A.113:  So.

B.114:  So there has been some flooding and,

A.115:  Oh, there's been a lot, yeah.

B.116:  (( )).

A.117:  It's, it's too bad but you know, the thing is that this happens, in the
last three years it's happened at least once a year, if not twice.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  But the people continue to move back in the flood [laughter] zones.

B.120:  Oh, gee.

A.121:  So, I don't know.  I mean, you got to wonder how long they're going to keep
doing that for.

B.122:  Yeah.

A.123:  I don't think I would.

B.124:  Oh, boy.

A.125:  Because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood.

B.126:  Yeah, oh, what a mess.

A.127:  Yeah.

B.128:  Well, now, do you work for T I?

A.129:  Yeah, I do, yeah.

B.130:  (( )) oh, uh-huh.  Huh.  Well, this has been an interesting thing to do.

A.131:  Have you made a lot of calls or,

B.132:  Um, I've, I've probably talked maybe to five people.  

A.133:  Uh-huh.

B.134:  My husband is doing it too, and he's --

A.135:  Oh.

B.136:  -- talked to a few more than me, and, but it's been real interesting and
kind of fun.

A.137:  Do you get paid for these?

B.138:  Um, five dollars.

A.139:  Five dollars a call?

B.140:  Uh-huh.

A.141:  Gosh, I wish I could do that [laughter].

B.142:  Uh, don't you have to do it as part of its,

A.143:  We can't get paid for it.

B.144:  Don't you have to do it,
