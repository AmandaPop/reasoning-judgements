========================================================================

A.1:  What kind of restaurants do you like, or what do you look for?

@B.2:  Well, I, depends on the mood I'm in.  Usually I like something like
Chili's or Bennigan's, something that's a, has a variety of menu.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, and friendly --

A.5:  Yes.

B.6:  -- friendly service [laughter].

A.7:  Yeah, that's a big plus, I've got a two year old and a four year old, so,
uh, I do-, I need some place that, well actually I've got very well behaved
kids, but I need some place,

B.8:  You're lucky.

A.9:  Yeah, everybody tells me they're angels, so, you know, 

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  I guess I just expect it, so I'm not, well, yeah, they're good [laughter].

B.12:  What do you all like?  Order of McDonalds, I imagine, with two and four
year olds.

A.13:  Actually no.  I hate going to McDonalds.

B.14:  Me too.

A.15:  We only go for very, very special occasions --

B.16:  Um.

A.17:  -- because I don't think they need to get used to that right now.

B.18:  No, you're right.  Good, good thinking.

A.19:  I actually like Mexican and,

B.20:  I like Mexican food too.  What's your favorite one?

A.21:  Um, there's not really a place up in the Garland or Richardson area that I
like to go.  But, you mean, that I found that is not real expensive.

B.22:  I love, I love, I go to El Fenix a lot --

A.23:  Oh, yeah.

B.24:  -- especially on their Wednesday night --

A.25:  Yeah, yeah.

B.26:  -- for that enchilada dinner.  Nice and cheap.

A.27:  [Laughter]  We've, we've been going there for like, oh, I'd say about
fifteen or twenty years.

B.28:  Yeah [laughter].

A.29:  Because we, I used to go there with my parents every Wednesday --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- night.  Yea, I do like that one.

B.32:  Yeah.  How about On the Border, have you ever gone there, #in Addison?#

A.33:  #No I haven't,# I've never been there.

B.34:  Oh #wonderful fajitas,# --

A.35:  #Think that would be good.#

B.36:  -- and the best chips and hot sauce, I think in town.

A.37:  Um, um.

B.38:  Because they bring the chips warm.  

A.39:  Ooh, that would be good.

B.40:  It's really, they're really, really good.

A.41:  Now we've been to Pappasito's up there on Central.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  They're good but they're a little pricey.

B.44:  Yeah.  I've never gone there.

A.45:  They're, they're pretty good, but when you take four people to dinner, it
gets like pretty expensive.

B.46:  Well, you can't take, any, any --

A.47:  I know [laughter]. 

B.48:  -- anybody to dinner four people and have it not be expensive, including
McDonalds.

A.49:  Well, this is true.  Boy, no kidding.

B.50:  And it just, anybody is nowadays.

A.51:  (( )).

B.52:  Every now and then, about once a year, have you ever gone to a restaurant
called Papillon's?

A.53:  No, I've heard of it.  Is it wonderful?

B.54:  It's out at, um, L B J and, uh, Abrams Road, and I have a friend, and we
go, once a year.

A.55:  Oh.

B.56:  It's our big, it's our big end of the year splurge,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter] because it's very expensive --

A.59:  Oh it's,

B.60:  -- and it's very elegant and,

A.61:  Oh, so is it kind of a continental kind of,

B.62:  Oh, kind of a continental, yes, one of those things that you say, I'd like
the third one down, I have no idea how to pronounce it but I've heard it's
wonderful.  Right.

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  And it is wonderful.  Everything, I mean, there, there's one, it's like
beef, and you, literally they don't give you a steak knife because you don't
need it.

A.65:  Ooh.

B.66:  It is so tender you can literally cut it with a butter knife.

A.67:  Ooh.

B.68:  I mean --

A.69:  That sounds good.

B.70:  -- and, oh, it is, and every now and then I like to do something like that.

A.71:  Yeah, yeah, I think I would like to splurge, too.  It sounds wonderful,
because I've had the flu and it's like --

B.72:  Oh.

A.73:  -- I can't eat, but now, this is making me hungry now, like, um, have to go
home and #make steak dinner.#

B.74:  #Sign that you're# getting well.

A.75:  Yes --

B.76:  Good.

A.77:  -- yes, I think so.

B.78:  [Laughter] Good.

A.79:  Oh, well, now, I'm, I'm, we're pretty much Mexican.  We, when we do go out,
normally we like to leave the kids at home so we can, like go out and --

B.80:  I don't blame you.
 
A.81:  -- not have to fight the children.  I mean, like I said, they are good,
but, there's only so much that kids that age can --

B.82:  Well --

A.83:  -- sit still for.

B.84:  -- there's only so good they can be --

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  -- and then you're just asking for trouble --

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  -- because they can't be any better than they're going to be.

A.89:  Oh, I know, we found one restaurant, uh, String Bean up on Belt Line --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- or Spring Valley or somewhere.

B.92:  Right.

A.93:  They've got a little kids room --

B.94:  How fun.

A.95:  -- which is nice because it's got games, it's got a couple of video games
and toys, and it's like here, Honey, you take the kids in there while I just
kind of stop [laughter].

B.96:  Wow.

A.97:  Let me just relax and you take the kids while we're waiting for supper.
And #it works great.#

B.98:  #That's nice.#

A.99:  Yeah, it, it's real good, and it's not just extremely loud in there, which
a lot of places are when you take kids, so.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  It's, um, pretty much like that, on,

B.102:  Um.  Well that's neat.  I find that I love to go to Steak and Ale.

A.103:  Oh, I do too.

B.104:  #That's one of my favorites.#

A.105:  #Especially for their prime rib.#

B.106:  My son used to work as a waiter there --

A.107:  Oh.

B.108:  -- so I, I feel real good there,

A.109:  [Laughter].

B.110:  because I walk in and everybody says, Well, hi Mrs Bush, how are you.

A.111:  [Laughter].

B.112:  Listen how's your son, da da ta da.  Oh, I feel so good there.

A.113:  It is part of the family, yes.

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  Yeah, we, I like to go there, we don't go there very often, but I do like
to go there just because it's nice to really be cuddled, and that's what I
feel like I'm getting there.

B.116:  Yes, and I like that in a restaurant.

A.117:  Yeah, oh, me too.

B.118:  There's some times I like for it to be quiet --

A.119:  Yes.

B.120:  -- just relaxed, little candlelight, as I said, it just depends on the mood
I'm in.

A.121:  We went to Steak and Ale one night and there was a family at the table next
to us that it was somebody's birthday and the girl went nuts.  This girl was
probably two years old maybe.

B.122:  Oh.

A.123:  She went ballistic because they started singing Happy Birthday, and
apparently she has some kind of a hearing problem.  Anytime she hears loud
noises it really affects her real bad.

B.124:  Um.

A.125:  And so, she just starts screaming and just going off the deep end, and so
for, and that night there were birthdays everywhere, because it was my
birthday too.

B.126:  Oh, my goodness.

A.127:  And the waiter was telling them, Um, you might want to take her outside for
a few minutes because we're fixing to do another birthday.  Well, it's 
like,

B.128:  [Laughter].
