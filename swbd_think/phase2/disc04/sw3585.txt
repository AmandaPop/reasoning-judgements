=======================================================================

A.1:  You go ahead and start or I will, whichever you prefer.

B.2:  Okay, um, well, I, the thing I like to do the most is swim, and I was doing
that real regularly, but I am expecting right now, 

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  and sick, and, uh, so I have kind of slowed down a little bit.  But
anyway, that's the thing that I've found works the best for me, is, is just
doing lap swimming.

A.5:  Well, me, I play, I love playing basketball and volleyball.

B.6:  Oh, do you?

A.7:  I do, and I play, well, I played a lot, [laughter] until I hurt my
shoulders this summer playing volleyball, and they haven't come back to full
swing yet, so, I haven't been able to play as much as I would have liked to
but,

B.8:  Oh.  Did you play in high school?

A.9:  No, in Texas they don't have, um, they don't have volleyball.  I played
basketball, but not on the school team --

B.10:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.11:  -- just played a lot (( )).  I didn't have, I worked, so I didn't really
[laughter] have time, but --

B.12:  Oh, yeah.

A.13:  -- it's, I love, actually athletics is really, for me, it's a great thing
to do.  I did it, one to keep in shape and two just to, to not stress.  It's
my release of tension.

B.14:  Oh, well, I know, my husband likes to do that.  He plays racquetball --

A.15:  Oh does he?

B.16:  -- too, yeah, uh-huh.  He does some.  He's, he's played it since, I guess
he was in college.  And then, um, he plays, uh, two or three times a week, so
he's a member of the Sports Mall in Salt Lake, and --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- he'll go on his noon hour, and he still likes to do that, so, that I
know that, that's one thing that he likes to do, and I think that relieves
stress too.

A.19:  That's awesome.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  Do you guys mostly exercise to relieve stress or to relax or, 

B.22:  Oh, well, I think I do it for, uh, weight reasons, I mean, you know, to --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- so you don't gain weight [laughter], 

A.25:  [Laughter].

B.26:  but, and also I, I know I feel a lot better when I do --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- but, I, like I said, I have just been really sick, and, and, just can't,
I'm just almost too tired.  I, I was going --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- um, in the mornings.

A.31:  Well, I tell you, having a kid is rough, isn't it [laughter].

B.32:  What?

A.33:  From what I hear, having a kid is rough.

B.34:  Well, yeah, we, we also have an eleven month old and a six year old, and --

A.35:  Oh, my.

B.36:  -- and so it's just kind of, 

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  um, finding the time for me to exercise is another thing --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- but I really do like to do it but,

A.41:  Well, great.

B.42:  Anyway.

A.43:  You're a brave woman to do all that [laughter].

B.44:  Oh, gee, well, like the kids kind of keep me exercising too --

A.45:  [Laughter] That's true.

B.46:  -- just chasing after them, I guess.

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  Yeah.  So, you, do you have much time to do that, since you're in college
now?

A.49:  Um, I make time, really if I, if I don't make time my study habits, or
actually I don't, my studying doesn't go as well.  I can't concentrate --

B.50:  And so --

A.51:  -- and so.

B.52:  -- it just kind of helps to work it in there.  

A.53:  Yeah, uh, really it's, if I don't, if I do it I feel like I get a lot more
accomplished in a day than if I don't.

B.54:  Huh.

A.55:  And so, it's, it's for me, it just is worthwhile to find time to, even if
for half an hour just to get out and run.

B.56:  Yeah, I think that's probably true with anything when you work some
exercise in.  It just seems like things seem to go more smoothly.  I don't
know.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  That should be a part of, I guess, everybody's daily things.

A.59:  I tend to agree.  I think it makes it a lot better for the person as well
as, as for a couple if you're married or if you're anything like that.  It
just helps to, I don't know, to have something to do.

B.60:  Oh, I know my husband wants me to take up golf.  

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  That's another thing he does, and, you know, I don't know that I see that
as a real big exercise, though.

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  I don't know.  I've, I've been a few times, but that's something, I am
really bad.

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  [Laughter] I mean, you know, it takes me a million strokes to get it in.
So,

A.67:  That's right, that's me, too, and I'm supposed to be good at it [laughter].

B.68:  Oh, so you do golf, huh.

A.69:  I do, no, I try, I'll put it that way.  I'm not very good at that.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  I enjoy it just because again, it gets me out, it gets me away from every,
all the stresses of school and work and,

B.72:  Oh, yeah.  Well, do you ski?

A.73:  I do.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  That's something I really enjoy, especially now that the snow's good this
year [laughter].

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  I've been a few times and --

B.78:  Have you.

A.79:  -- really enjoyed it.  It's amazing how each exercise works on a different
part of your body.  I never realized, you know, I thought basketball basically
covered it all, but after I skied a few times I've just been dead.

B.80:  Yeah, you felt some muscles that you [laughter], 

A.81:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.82:  Oh, I haven't been skiing for years.  

A.83:  Oh really.  (( )).

B.84:  Huh-uh.  Not downhill.  We do have cross country skies and --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- and I, I enjoy that.  But I don't know, downhill, I was always real bad
at that too, and it's just the, thoughts of it kind of scare me.

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  [Laughter] I was one of these out of control --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- skiers but, 

A.91:  [Laughter].

B.92:  [Laughter] Well.

A.93:  It's kind of how I did it, too.

B.94:  You what.

A.95:  That's kind of how I did it, too.

@@B.96:  Oh, well, so you have, are you just starting out at school?

A.97:  No, I'm about three-fourths through.

B.98:  Oh, are you.

A.99:  I have another year, year and a half until I graduate.  So.

B.100:  Oh, huh.

A.101:  Hopefully we'll make it through.  I'm getting married in May, so we're
trying to get through school as quick as we can.

B.102:  Oh, you are.  Well, that's exciting.  Congratulations.

A.103:  Well, thank you.  It's, it's fun.  It gives me more motive to exercise as
well.

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  [Laughter].

B.106:  Well good.

A.107:  Anyway, we'd better cut this off before they scream at us but, 

B.108:  Well, yeah, it's nice to talk to you and,

A.109:  It's been my pleasure.

B.110:  Good luck in everything.

A.111:  Well thanks, you have a great day, all right?

B.112:  Okay, you too.

A.113:  Thanks.  #Bye-bye.#

B.114:  #Bye-bye.#
