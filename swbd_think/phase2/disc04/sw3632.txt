========================================================================

A.1:  Do you take magazines?

B.2:  Well, the only one I get right now is the JOURNAL, and I'm really kind of
tired of it because it comes out on the newsstand before I ever get it.

A.3:  Oh.

B.4:  So I don't think I'm going to subscribe to it anymore.

A.5:  Oh.  

B.6:  [Lipsmack] {faint}.  #So.#

A.7:  #We# really enjoy the magazines I take.  I take several, uh, or I take two
through the church.

B.8:  #Uh-huh.#

A.9:  #And then# I take, uh, READER'S DIGEST, NATIONAL GEO-, GEOGRAPHIC and
[breathing] BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS and MCCALL'S and, uh, oh, REDBOOK.

B.10:  Oh, that's a lot.  I like REDBOOK.  I'm, I never would have time to read
all those magazines.  Most of the time when I grab one, I'm at the airport.

A.11:  Oh, do you travel a #lot?#

B.12:  #I# do, I travel a lot, and I just usually will do that, you know, grab one
then, and that's about the only time I read them so #[laughter],#

A.13:  #Oh.#

B.14:  Sometimes I'll pick one up because it looks good, and I don't even get to
see it, #so.#

A.15:  #Oh.# Well, I, I, uh, [lipsmack] I work volunteer at the hospital, and a
lot of times I'll take them in there --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and go through them and pick out the articles I like and [breathing] --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- and read them.  But I really enjoy [breathing] the magazines.  I don't
[breathing] I really don't read them as much as I would like to.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  But I do like to pick them up and go through them, especially if they're
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC and READER'S DIGEST.  I really enjoy #those two.#

B.22:  #Well,# READER'S DIGEST is always a good magazine.

A.23:  Yes.

B.24:  So it's great, it's got #lots# --

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  -- of different things in.  But as far as the articles go, I just find we
go round and round on the same things an awful lot, so [laughter],

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  I'm just sort of tired of that and,

A.29:  Oh.

B.30:  [Lipsmack] {faint}.  I don't #know.#

A.31:  #Well,# if the only time you read them is at the airport, I can see why.

B.32:  Yeah, and I prefer to read a book, I really do.  I like to do that better
and,

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  I don't know.

A.35:  Well, you must be, you must have a job then.

B.36:  I'm sorry?

A.37:  You must have a, you must be employed.

B.38:  Oh, yeah.  I'm a nurse and --

A.39:  Oh, are #you?#

B.40:  -- #and# I work float, and so I work lots of days and lots of hours and --

A.41:  Oh.

B.42:  -- different times, and #so,# 

A.43:  #And# you don't have time to read then.  Oh, you, you say that you like a
book better.  #I read books# --

B.44:  #Yeah,# I do.

A.45:  -- too, but I read them at night before I go to bed [laughter].

B.46:  Well, I read about one page, and then #I'm asleep, so I don't get very,# 

A.47:  #[Laughter].#

B.48:  far at night that #way.#

A.49:  #Oh,# 

B.50:  And --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- I guess with the holidays and all, I haven't even picked up a book or a
magazine [laughter] #in about# --

A.53:  #Oh.#

B.54:  -- a month #but,# 

A.55:  #Oh.#  

B.56:  [Breathing].  

A.57:  We have a son that flies, flies for American Airlines #He's a# --

B.58:  #Oh,# does he really?

A.59:  -- he's a pilot, uh-huh.

B.60:  #Oh.#

A.61:  #We# have another son that's a doctor too.  But anyway, I, but when I wake
up in the night and can't go back to sleep, a lot of times I read, and my
husband has been really good about that [laughter].

B.62:  Yeah, yeah, #that's good.#

A.63:  #Because I,# I do enjoy reading a lot, but #I'm# --

B.64:  #Yeah.# 

A.65:  -- not employed outside of the home either, so #I,# 

B.66:  #So# that gives you a little more time to do that, yeah.  I, I have an
application in with American right now for flight attendant, actually, so --

A.67:  [Lipsmack] Oh.

B.68:  -- that's what I would like to do #[laughter].#

A.69:  #Oh.#  He sure enjoys it.

B.70:  Yeah.  Well, I, I was married to someone who worked for American, and I
miss having my flight privileges.

A.71:  Boy, we would too, because we've got kids all over the world.

B.72:  Uh-huh, and, and it's just really, you know, I've got friends all over the
world, so if I ever want to see them again --

A.73:  #Uh-huh.#

B.74:  -- #I need# to get me a job at the airlines and --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- I've always wanted to fly, so with my nursing background, I'm hoping
that I will be able to.

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  [Lipsmack] So we'll see.  But American's the best so #[laughter].#

A.79:  #[Laughter].  Oh, he sure thinks# --

B.80:  Trying to hold out for that #[laughter].#

A.81:  -- #[Laughter]# he sure thinks so.  I saw by the paper today that they're
going to lay off a thousand, two hundred people, though, but it's mostly going
to be ground crew so,

B.82:  Oh, really?  #Yeah.#

A.83:  #And my# son is a pilot too, so he'll be okay I,

B.84:  He'll be okay, yeah.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  Yeah, I've heard that they were expecting some layoffs, #but# --

A.87:  #Uh-huh.#

B.88:  -- I don't know.

A.89:  Oh.  Don't you have time to read when you are at work?

B.90:  No, never [laughter] #no.#

A.91:  #That# busy, huh?

B.92:  [Breathing] I don't even have time to go to lunch #[laughter].#

A.93:  #[Laughter] Oh.#

B.94:  [Laughter]  We grab lunch on the floor.  We #bring# --

A.95:  #Oh.#

B.96:  -- our lunch and we spend ten minutes where we can, and we're busy most all
the time.  There are days when, you know, we can kick back, but then we sort
of visit.

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  You know, that kind of #thing, so.#

A.99:  #Which# hospital are you at?

B.100:  I'm at Presbyterian in Dallas.

A.101:  Oh.  Our grandson just had open heart surgery, but I'm not sure which
hospital.

B.102:  Probably,

A.103:  [Bell]. 

B.104:  Children's Medical.

A.105:  I imagine #so.#

B.106:  #Yeah.#

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  Yeah.  How did he do?

A.109:  Real well, real well.

B.110:  That's good, yeah.

A.111:  Yeah he,

B.112:  Well, I float. 

A.113:  [/Bell].  

B.114:  I go to different hospitals.  I work for agencies --

A.115:  Oh.

B.116:  -- besides Presbyterian, so it, it stays pretty interesting that way.

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  Different places at different times and --

A.119:  Uh-huh.  Oh.

B.120:  -- I keep learning then #[laughter].#

A.121:  #[Laughter]# Oh.  Well, the JOURNAL is one of my, the LADIES HOME JOURNAL,
is that what you're referring to?

B.122:  Uh-huh, #right.#

A.123:  #That's# one of my very favorite magazines.

B.124:  It's always been one of my favorites, and I first turn to CAN THIS MARRIAGE
BE SAVED.  I love that column [breathing] #and,# 

A.125:  #Oh,# yes, me too.

B.126:  Uh-huh #[laughter].#

A.127:  #Uh-huh [laughter]. ((That)),#

B.128:  And it's always been one of my favorites, but I've just noticed that by the
time I get it, I would like to have bought it someplace.

A.129:  Oh.
