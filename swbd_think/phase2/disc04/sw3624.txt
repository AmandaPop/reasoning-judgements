======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, all set.

B.2:  Good morning [laughter].

@A.3:  [Laughter]  Good morning. Let's see, music, um, well, I play a couple of
instruments.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  I try to.

B.6:  What do you play?

A.7:  Um, clarinet is my primary instrument, and I also play a little bit of
saxophone, flute and piano --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.

B.10:  Really, that's too bad [laughter].

A.11:  [Laughter] How about yourself?

B.12:  I play, uh, the violin --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and play trumpet --

A.15:  Uh.

B.16:  -- and I run a municipal band and I sometimes conduct.

A.17:  Oh, wow.

B.18:  So, I'm pretty busy too.  I play in three different symphony orchestras.

A.19:  Wow.

B.20:  We have a --

A.21:  That's great.

B.22:  -- nice big one here in State College, called the ((Nitny)) Valley --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- Symphony.  I play in the Altoona Symphony, was about forty-five miles
away --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- Symphony and Community Orchestra.

A.29:  Uh-huh.  So are you a professional musician?

B.30:  No, I'm, uh, just retiring from Penn State University --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- only I, I should, [laughter] should have been.  I spend about half my
time playing music or preparing for it somewhere.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  But, uh, I've been working at, uh, Penn State --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- and using up all my nighttimes,

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  and weekends --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- uh, going to these orchestra rehearsals and, and concerts and so forth.

A.41:  Uh-huh, I understand, yeah.  I'm in one community band here, and that's
just, well, we rehearse once a week.  We generally have a concert every other
week and,

B.42:  You have one that often.

A.43:  Yeah [laughter].

B.44:  That's amazing because --

A.45:  That's a lot.

B.46:  -- I, I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven
rehearsals per concert.

A.47:  No, we sure don't.

B.48:  Wow.

A.49:  Well, one thing is, we have a summer ser-, summer series, and every single
Sunday night we play at the library to have a little --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- out, outdoor stage set up --

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  -- and so we do that every Sunday night --

B.54:  You are busy.

A.55:  -- during the summer, yeah, and then, I don't know.  We just have an awful
lot of engagements, and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, um,
because, you know, uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to
back or even two days in a row.

B.56:  Where do you get all this music, I mean, you, you must back up and play
some of the music twice.

A.57:  Oh yes, definitely,

B.58:  [Throat_clearing].

A.59:  we really do.  You know, you get your little Sousa book and you just
flip [laughter] through it, and that sort of thing.

B.60:  Oh, okay.  So your, you don't play pretty well a full concert band music
most of the time then.

A.61:  It really depends on who shows up.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  Um, and it's always a mystery, because it actually doesn't matter who shows
up, it matters what instruments they brought, because so many --

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  -- people switch instruments so often.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  But, um, yeah, in the winter we do more concert stuff and,

B.68:  How many people in your band?

A.69:  Um, I think there's about seventy.

B.70:  Seventy.

A.71:  Yeah, there's a lot.

B.72:  Holy mackerel, that's.

A.73:  But, on any given night there's not seventy --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- you know, it alternates quite a lot.

B.76:  Boy, that is a huge organization, that's great.

A.77:  Yeah, it really is.

B.78:  Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty --

A.79:  [Laughter]  Oh.

B.80:  -- in, in the band I have here.

A.81:  Yeah, well.

B.82:  But that fills a stage and keeps us busy, but [throat_clearing] they were,
half have been professionals from, uh, a lot of them are from, uh, faculty at
Penn State here.

A.83:  Oh, okay.

B.84:  And so they want to play things that, uh, push them to do.  So that's why
we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  We have about four concerts per year indoors --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- and two or three that we play outside.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  And the last one we did was in a large, uh, mall close here, we played
Christmas about an hour out in this mall.

A.91:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.92:  So that worked out very nicely.

A.93:  Yeah, that's fun.  

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  Well, let's see.  Well, there's another band around here.  Someone at work
is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and their concert schedule isn't as heavy, but they have more in the
summer, I think they have ten in the summer, you know, one, one week after the
other.  I think they're like Monday nights --

B.98:  Wow, that.

A.99:  -- and they don't have rehearsals during that time period.

B.100:  Are you just saying you, you sight read every concert?

A.101:  Uh, well, it's not really sight reading when you've done it, you know,
again and again and again, but --

B.102:  Okay.

A.103:  -- some people are, yeah --

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  -- some of them are.

B.106:  And where, where does this happen, Laurie, is this in Dallas?

A.107:  Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  We're real close to Dallas.

B.110:  Well, I declare. 

A.111:  Yeah.

B.112:  That's amazing.

A.113:  Yeah, well, it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group
than anything else, you know.

B.114:  Okay.

A.115:  And, and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and --

B.116:  Okay.

A.117:  -- hang around for an hour or so and,

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  That's probably why we get so many people.

B.120:  Do any of your, you, in your group get paid for any of this?

A.121:  Um, well, the conductor gets paid a little bit, you know, we do get some
money from the city --

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  -- because we do play at a lot of city events.

B.124:  Uh-huh.

A.125:  Um, I think he's the only one that gets paid.

B.126:  Uh-huh.  And you do have to buy your music.  Who, who sponsors you
basically, the city?

A.127:  The city, uh-huh.

B.128:  Yeah, uh, my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation.

A.129:  Yeah, it's a similar thing.

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  I can't remember what they call it, but the same type of thing.

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  Um, but we do get an awful lot of music, you know, we can borrow music from
any of the area colleges --

B.134:  Yes.

A.135:  -- or, you know, if some, some group just isn't going to play any more,
they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.

B.136:  Uh-huh.

A.137:  And we do an awful lot of, you know, we don't charge for any of our
performances, but we get a lot of donations.

B.138:  Well, I, I work the same way [laughter].

A.139:  Yeah [laughter].

B.140:  Well, I'll be darned.  It's amazing.
