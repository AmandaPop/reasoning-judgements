A.1:  Do you like them?  

B.2:  Well, uh, the most I've done so far is like, uh, landscaping, you know,
bushes and shrubs and stuff like that.  My wife likes to put out flowers and
stuff in the flower beds [throat_clearing].  So I'm always having to, uh, turn
the flower beds for her every year.  She puts the flowers and I try to
maintain the bushes and trees and stuff.

A.3:  Well, I do vegetable gardening.  I rent a Rototiller once a year in January
and turn everything and then I start putting stuff in in --

B.4:  Um. 

A.5:  -- third week in January and there's stuff pretty much out there until
freeze hits whenever that is.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  So I usually start off with onions and garlic -- 

B.8:  Um.  

A.9:  -- and then I put in beets.  

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  And then, uh, 

B.12:  Green beans?  

A.13:  R-, r-, red beets, but you can eat the tops, too.  

B.14:  Oh, I see.  

A.15:  And then I usually put out, uh, some kind of spinach or some type green
like that and then in April is when the tomatoes and peppers and lima beans
and --

B.16:  Um.  

A.17:  -- black eyed peas and cucumbers and all that other good stuff goes out.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  Uh, each year I try something I've never tried before.  This year I'm
trying a product called, well, it's called spaghetti.  Basically it's a squash
like product when you cook it.

B.20:  Oh, yeah, I've heard of that.  

A.21:  Yeah, I've never tried that before.  Each year I try something new and so
this is the one we tried.  See if it works down here.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  Well, my wife has rosebushes and she takes care of those.  

B.24:  Uh, I see.  I'd like to do vegetable garden, but I don't have the yard size
for it.  I'm in a zero lot line home.  But, uh, we're thinking of moving this
year.  The interest rates are getting so low, we can't afford not to.

A.25:  Well, you know, the vegetable gardens don't have to be very big.  This plot
I have is twenty-two by eight, so that's a hundred and seventy-six square
feet, which is not very big and, you know, if you have crops in the early
spring and then crops in the summer and crops in the fall --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- on the same spot, you can put a minimum of two different crops, like
where I have, uh, uh, onions and garlic, sometimes I'm put other things, you
know --

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- because the onions and garlics will mature in June or July. 

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  [Sneezing] Excuse me.  

B.32:  (( )).

A.33:  [Sneezing]. 

B.34:  So how do your t-, tomatoes do down here, pretty good?  

A.35:  Oh, they do real well.  

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  I used a crop called Better Boy for several years which did well, but it
has not done well the last couple years, so in --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- this past year [sneezing] I tried a new crop called Celebrity.

B.40:  Um.  

A.41:  And Celebrity gave me pretty much continuous [sniffing] tomatoes from the,
uh, first week in June until the freeze hit in November.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  Course, I think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain, but I
had --

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- tomatoes on the table every day for five months, which is,

B.46:  Wow, that's pretty good.  

A.47:  In the, in the past I usually got tomatoes for three, four weeks and that
would be it and then --

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- in the fall I'd, you know, get a couple more weeks, but this is a very
unusual year.

B.50:  Uh.  You try fruit like, uh, strawberries and,

A.51:  Well, we did have strawberries a few years ago, but we don't do them
anymore.  And we had a peach tree and it was too much hassle.  You have to
spray it --

B.52:  Um.  

A.53:  -- and, uh, cover the fruit from the birds and -- 

B.54:  Um.  

A.55:  -- all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was
worth.

B.56:  Yeah.  So vegetables are much easier then.  

A.57:  Vegetables are pretty easy, I think.  Fruit is, has some difficulties.  Of
course, any, some vegetables are probably more work than others.  The --

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- hard part is at the very beginning when you have set up the garden and
everything, but once the plants get going and then --

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  -- it's just a matter of keeping the insects off.  

B.62:  Yeah, well, that sounds neat.  You ever do anything like melons?

A.63:  No.  

B.64:  No.  

A.65:  Never done that.  

B.66:  I remember one year at my parents' old house we grew a, uh, I guess a
pump-, a squash plant, you know turned out to be a pumpkin and, uh, it, it
bore pretty good size fruit.  And then one year we just let one of the
squashes grow out.  Produced a really huge pumpkin.  We're pretty surprised.
And they just got lucky because they didn't do anything to it, no fertilizing
or anything.  Just kind of [laughter] threw the seeds out there.  But, uh --

A.67:  Um, that's strange.  Well, you must have been lucky.   

B.68:  -- that's pretty neat.  Yeah.  This was down in San Antonio, so, I know,

A.69:  Well, the climate's a little better for that down there for hot weather.

B.70:  I think so, too.  I think so, too.  I, you know, I noticed here in Dallas,
well, maybe it depends on where you live, but it's like the shrubs don't do as
well.  They don't grow as fast.

A.71:  Well, that's, sometimes you have h-, cold winters, but we haven't had
anything so far this year.

B.72:  Yeah, yeah, I've got a tree that I planted that doesn't, it's okay, but it
doesn't, you know, my dad planted a tree two years after I planted mine and
his is like three times as big as mine.

A.73:  Wow.  

B.74:  I don't know what it is.  I,

A.75:  Must be the soil.  

B.76:  I think it is.  Uh, I have a feeling that the soil's not there's a lot of
rocks in it because all around me I can see where the erosion is from, from
the creek beds.  There's a lot of rock under me.  I have a feeling I'm, I'm
probably, the roots are probably hitting rocks or something.

A.77:  Um, it's hard for them to go once they have no dirt there.  

B.78:  Yeah.  I try to keep it going, but it's not getting very big.  I think in
five years, it grew like three or four feet.

A.79:  Well, you need,

B.80:  I know I,
