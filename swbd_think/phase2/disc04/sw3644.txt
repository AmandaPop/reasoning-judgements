==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what are the capital punishment laws in your state?  

@B.2:  Uh, they're,   

A.3:  Or do you have it?  

B.4:  Uh, the, the, the death penalty can be imposed.  

A.5:  Yeah, uh, or is it set for a specific crimes, you know, if you're convicted
of this, then it's the death penalty, or, or is it kind of just to the
discretion of the certain cases?

B.6:  Uh, it's, uh, murder can be, is I think, is the only can be tried for, you
know, for, uh, capital punishment.  And I firmly believe in it.

A.7:  Yes, I, I'm the same way.  I feel that capital punishment ought to be
mandatory under certain crimes.

B.8:  I do, too.  Here in Utah, there's been a, a person that's been on death row
for, I, oh, seventeen years I think, and they just keep retrying and retrying
and I just, it's just a waste of taxpayers' money and, and I really think it
would be a deterrent.

A.9:  Sounds like he'd grow old and die long before they get to kill him.

B.10:  Yes, yes.  #But, uh,# 

A.11:  #Seventeen# years on death row.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.  Uh, I think he's, he's the longest one in the nation that, and
they just keep retrying him and retrying him.

A.13:  Well, uh, since they reinstated the death penalty, was it about seven or
eight years ago, I think the shortest anybody's waited has been two or three
years.  I mean, death penalty does not seem to be swift for anybody.

B.14:  No.  Is, what's the death penalty in Mississippi?

A.15:  I, to the best -- 

B.16:  I mean the,

A.17:  -- of my understanding, they do not have death penalty here right now.  Uh,
oh, you know, it doesn't make any sense that they don't, but they don't.  Uh,
and right now to the best of my understanding there is nothing afoot to get it
reinstated.  Uh, personally I think there should be death penalty for, uh, the
death penalty should be available almost any major violent crime and mandatory
for murder.

B.18:  I, I agree with you [laughter].  They,

A.19:  Yeah, it should be at least available as punishment for rape. 

B.20:  Yes, definitely.  

A.21:  I think if it was a serious [breathing] possible being executed for doing
any of the major crimes, that it would be a little less likely for people to
commit them.

B.22:  Well, one think I can't understand is, is the people that, uh, uh, tort-,
torture children and then murder, I mean, you know, and then they're, they
eventually kill them.

A.23:  Yes.  

B.24:  And I definitely think that that should be a death penalty and they get
less than, than people that are murdered.

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  I don't understand that.  I, I just can't see how come a person that h-,
kills a little child can get away with two or three years or five years, five
to fifteen.

A.27:  Yeah, and it, I don't know, I, if, I think also they should be, they, uh,
somebody providing drugs to someone that kills the person --

B.28:  Yes.  

A.29:  -- that ought to be considered murder and potential death penalty.

B.30:  Boy, we think alike [laughter].  

A.31:  Uh, it, they used to have the death penalty in my home state of West
Virginia.

B.32:  Oh. 

A.33:  And there it was death by hanging.  

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  Uh, but,

B.36:  How old are you, may I ask?  

A.37:  Thirty-four.  

B.38:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.39:  And it, when they eliminated death penalty, all kinds of things changed.

B.40:  Yes, they do.  

A.41:  And the rate of crime doubled within a, about a year or so.  

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  And at that point when they were still hanging, the, uh, state prison in
Mountsville, uh, had a very small guard force and they had very little
problems with their, their inmates.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  Uh, after they eliminated the death penalty -- 

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- shut down the gallows -- 

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- uh, place has gotten to the point where people who live in that area are
all trying to get moved away.  It has become a maximum security prison.  They
have had a whole lot more problems with breakouts, with, uh, with violence
within the, the prison.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  Uh, just the whole, whole tenor of the thing has changed completely.

B.52:  I wonder what, I wonder why they don't, uh, don't see that they need the
death penalty, then because haven't you heard that they say that the death
penalty does not, uh, deter crime.

A.53:  Who is it who said the death penalty doesn't de-, c-, well, I'm sure it
doesn't much now, because the death penalty is very seldom --

B.54:  Yes.  

A.55:  -- uh, given and even then, like you say, it could be [breathing] twenty
years between the time,
