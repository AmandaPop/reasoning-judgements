each other a lot.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, are you presently looking, uh, for a used car?  

B.2:  Well, as a matter of fact, I just bought one [laughter].  

A.3:  Just bought one.  

B.4:  Just, just within the last three weeks.  

A.5:  S-, what did you get?  

B.6:  I got a Lexus L S four hundred.  

A.7:  Lexus.  Uh,

B.8:  Which is made by Toyota.  

A.9:  Okay, Lexus is a Toyota subbrand.  

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  Okay.  

B.12:  It's kind of their,

A.13:  I was wondering where that came from because they're talking like it was an
American built car.

B.14:  Right, it, it sounds like it, but it really isn't [laughter]. 

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  It's, uh, marketed, of course, it its own dealerships.  

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  Usually, or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus
dealership, uh --

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  -- sometimes they do that, but -- 

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  -- it's, uh, a brand car, but I've really liked it.  It, it drives just
wonderfully and there is, it's so quiet, almost can't tell the engine is
running.

A.23:  That's their big selling point, uh, other than general luxury and, but the
particular seems to be the, uh, [noise] the quiet ride.

B.24:  It really is.  It's got pretty good acceleration, too.  

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  It's got a C D player in it, so I can, I can play those and,

A.27:  Uh, was, that wasn't a standard, p-, feature, was it?  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  Okay.  

B.30:  But there is not very many options on that car.

A.31:  Uh,

B.32:  There is only about five or six options.  Everything else is standard.

A.33:  Yeah, you get #the impression that,# 

B.34:  #Uh, some of the# tracking control things and skidding control things for
up north.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  The C D and the premium sound system.  

A.37:  Skidding control, you mean the antilock brake system?  

B.38:  Yeah, it's kind of a traction control, I think they call it. 

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  It's, it's not just antilock brake.  I think that's already on most of
them, but --

A.41:  Oh, this is a, uh,

B.42:  -- there is a further traction control, uh,

A.43:  Uh, probably suspension tied into -- 

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- the brakes.  

B.46:  And, and also the suspension can be raised for driving, like in the ice and
snow.  It can raise the car's center up a little bit.

A.47:  Um.  

B.48:  For going under -- 

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  -- a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan [laughter] or
somewhere.

A.51:  Yeah, uh, shoot -- 

B.52:  Mississippi probably doesn't,

A.53:  -- some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.  

B.54:  Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much [laughter].

A.55:  No, snow doesn't happen very often.  

B.56:  If it does, people go, what's this stuff.  

A.57:  Yeah, uh, originally I'm from West Virginia.  We got a -- 

B.58:  Oh, #well, you had some there.#  

A.59:  -- #pretty fair amount# of snow.  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  But, uh, I got down here in June of eighty-four, and the first winter down
here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years, and it was
amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane, manly, adult men
into playful little children.

B.62:  Oh, I know.  

A.63:  We had this group of, uh, surveyors come into, uh, a shop I was working in,
uh, four or five of them, these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all
over the place.  They had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get
the oil checked.  But, while they were there they set back [laughter], drank
about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of
their vehicles --

B.64:  Oh, no.  

A.65:  -- threw snowballs all over the place,

B.66:  [Laughter]. 

A.67:  had themselves a ball for about an hour [laughter].  

B.68:  Well, the, uh, the Lexus, uh, really, and the moon roof I think is also an
option.

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  Although most of them are ordered them with it, but there really is only
about a half a dozen, uh, things and --

A.71:  Yeah. 

B.72:  -- everything else is pretty standard.  I did not get the traction control
which also, when you take the c-, traction control and the [breathing], and
the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats, too.

A.73:  Oh, so that's kind of,

B.74:  You go out and get in that real cold car --

A.75:  #It's a package deal.#

B.76:  -- #and you turn that on,# and it, yeah, and it kind of, uh, but that's
only available if, with the traction control and the other option.

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  And those two are sold together so you have to take a two thousand dollar
option there to --

A.79:  Ouch.  

B.80:  -- to, uh, do it, so I, I opted not for that but,  

A.81:  No, it doesn't sound real necessary in Texas.  

B.82:  And, uh, the dealership I dealt with, they order them all with the, uh,
moon roof and, uh --

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  -- you know, nice floor mats and everything in there.  

A.85:  Yeah, I worked #for Lincoln,# 

B.86:  #So the only thing# I had to decide on was whether I wanted a C D or not in
the stereo system and that was pretty much it.  And they had like three or
four basic packages that they --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- they offer.  

A.89:  Sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer I used to work for.  They didn't
order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got.  Little
Mercury Tracer --

B.90:  Yeah, I've been o-, I've been,

A.91:  -- imagine, or not, they make a, they make a luxury Mercury Tracer.

B.92:  Yeah, I've seen that in the dealership.  I was driving a Lincoln, a Mark
Seven --

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  -- for the last four years before I traded it for this and, uh, I'm leasing
the Lexus.  I usually lease them --

A.95:  Yeah.  

B.96:  -- since I own a business I just run it through my business, but --

A.97:  Uh-huh.  

B.98:  -- but it, the Lincoln ride is certainly good, too, but the, this Lexus is
nothing like I have ever been in before.  It's just,

A.99:  Like sitting in your living room.  

B.100:  Yeah, it really is, and it's got a lumbar support in the seats.

A.101:  Adjustable?  

B.102:  Adjustable, uh --

A.103:  Yeah {faint}.

B.104:  -- power and just kind of brings that support up in the sma-,
