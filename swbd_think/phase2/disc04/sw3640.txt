==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, why don't you tell me about the Brewers.  

B.2:  [Breathing] Well, uh, [breathing] I guess the thing about the Brewers is I
think their personnel policies have been a little misguided lately.  Uh, I
think that's their main problem.  Uh, they seem to have stuck with the same
core of players, uh, Robin Yount, Paul Molitor and Jim Gantner who, uh,
they're real good players, but they seem to just depend on them to produce a
pennant.  And i-, it d-, it isn't working.

A.3:  Well, the problem with the Rangers is they've got a lot of offense, they
just don't have any pitching and really haven't had any pitching for years.
They're the top offensive team around, but defense and pitching wins your
games over the long haul.

B.4:  Except for Papa Ryan anyway.  

A.5:  Well, that's true, but -- 

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  -- he only comes every five times so,

B.8:  That's right, he can't win them all for him.  

A.9:  He win them all and he's getting a little bit up there.  

B.10:  Yeah, I think, uh, the thing about the Brewers is, too, their pitching.
They never have really had real good pitching.  Uh, last time they had really
good pitching was back in the early eighties when they got to the World Series
with, uh, people like Vuckovich and Fingers.

A.11:  Uh, yes, Wally Fingers. 

B.12:  Yeah, yeah and, of course, uh, he got them to the Series but then just
before the Series that year in eighty-two he, uh, uh, threw his elbow out or
something, shoulder or elbow, I can't remember which and, uh, they're number
two right-hander in the bullpen, Pete Ladd who was kind of a rookie that year,
uh, had to take his place and, uh, I think that's why they lost the Series
because in, in game two in Saint Louis, they had a pretty good lead going into
late innings and Ladd got rattled when he didn't get some calls and they ended
up losing the game.  Uh, old, mustache Fingers would not have done that.

A.13:  Well, Wally was, Wally was more, uh, [breathing] oh, I guess he's, uh, is
he in the Hall of Fame already?  I don't even remember.

B.14:  I can't remember if he's made it or not, yet.  He, he may not have been, I
don't know when he retired actually.

A.15:  You got to be retired for five years to be eligible.  

B.16:  Yeah, but that was, I think eighty-two was, well, eighty-one was the year I
think that he won the, the, uh, Cy Young and the M V P and the Fireman of the
Year award all at the same time, I think.  But, uh, but in eighty-two I think
he won something, some kind of award.  Had a lot of saves anyway.

A.17:  Yeah, we had a game here where, uh, we had Goose Gossage this year and
Goose and, uh, Ryan to combine and they got, I don't know [buzz], Ryan got his
three hundred something ((th-,)) win and at the same time Goose got his three
hundred and something safe and they were, you know, the same [/buzz] number.
And they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that.

B.18:  Well, I'd forgotten that Gossage was with the Rangers, the, the, he was
this year.

A.19:  Yeah, but -- 

B.20:  Last year.  

A.21:  -- he's not coming back.  

B.22:  Now did they pick him up, uh, sometime in the middle of the season or who?

A.23:  Well, no, they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the,
and manager Bobby Valentine didn't come along so --

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  -- Goose is, Goose is history.  

B.26:  Yeah, well, he's been quite a reliever in his time.  

A.27:  Oh, yeah, he's a, he's, he's definitely headed to the Hall of Fame.  But
the Rangers have, you know, a, a pretty good lineup now, uh, with the, with
the addition of the, uh, Dickey ((Thorne)) at, uh, short stop.  That ought to
help them, but their problem is, other than Ryan and an occasional flash of
brilliance of other people there is just nobody there.

B.28:  Yeah.  Well, we'll be looking for them to, uh, to improve in that area I
guess because at least the, uh, now that I think about them a little bit, I'm
getting sort of back through the football season back into [laughter] baseball
I realize when you think of the Rangers now you got a real good looking young
outfield there for the most part and, uh, quite a few of the infielders are,
uh, probably have g-, real good careers still ahead of them.  I'm not sure why
they got rid of Buechele but I guess it worked out for him okay.

A.29:  Well, at least he got a play in the championship.  The Rangers have never
won the division so --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- we're obviously not going to last year.    

B.32:  Old Inky went the wrong way, though, didn't he?  

A.33:  Yeah, I think he's history.  

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  He is history.  

B.36:  Now who did they trade him to, I f-, Cleveland?  

A.37:  Detroit.  

B.38:  Detroit.  

A.39:  Well, they didn't,

B.40:  Oh.

A.41:  Yeah, they, he went to Detroit, they really didn't get much for him.

B.42:  Oh, they released him really, didn't they.  

A.43:  Yeah, they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with
somebody.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  But he proved to be a total disaster.  

B.46:  My goodness, when he was, when he was, when he could really get into a
ball, though, he was, uh, had a lot of power.  I tell you, he reminds me a lot
of Gorman Thomas.  Remember him?

A.47:  Yeah.  

B.48:  Center fielder for the Brewers there for a while.  

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  #There is a guy,# 

A.51:  #He did something,# I, I saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when I was
there, but I also him drop a ball that cost a couple runs, ended up costing
the game, so he could, you know, he could be both brilliant and, with a bat,
and just a disaster in the field.

B.52:  Uh, well, I don't think his fielding was generally that bad.  He, uh, as a
matter of fact, he was t-,

A.53:  It was early on, it got better but it -- 

B.54:  Yeah, right.  

A.55:  -- was pretty bad at the beginning.  

B.56:  Yeah, he did get better and I think, uh, he was one of George Bamburger's
big projects when he took over the Brew-, uh, Milwaukee.  He was the guy that
was up and down, uh,
