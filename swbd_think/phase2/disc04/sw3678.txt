uh, hobbies?

B.69:  Well, I didn't, I, we jog quite a bit, um, this.

A.70:  You and your husband?

B.71:  My husband and I, yes.  And, um, we take one of our dogs, she jogs with us,
and just recently I did my first fifteen K, which is a little over nine miles.

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  So hopefully this year I'll be able to do a half of a marathon, which is
thirteen miles, so.

A.74:  Oh, yeah.

B.75:  That's kind of what I'd like to work up to.  I've been ill a little bit
over the holidays so I haven't, um, had time to, um, you know --

A.76:  Uh-huh.

B.77:  -- do any type of running really.

A.78:  We have two sons that run.  

B.79:  Uh-huh.

so they, uh, they do those marathons too.

B.83:  What kind of painting do you do?

A.84:  Tole painting and, uh, painting on wood, wood things --

B.85:  Uh-huh.

A.86:  -- mostly.  I don't do any oil or anything like that.

B.87:  My mother just started painting, and so.

A.88:  With what?

B.89:  Uh, she started water color, and she took a class at the local community
college, and I wanted her to take another class.  She wants to, uh, I think
get into some drawing by hand --

A.90:  Uh-huh.

B.91:  -- because that's what she (( )) best with.

A.92:  Uh-huh.

B.93:  But other than that I don't have a whole lot of hobbies.  I've got three
pets, and they pretty much, two dogs and a cat, and they keep me kind of busy,
and [inhaling].

A.94:  Well, those are hobbies, aren't they?

B.95:  Yeah, I suppose so.

A.96:  What kind of dogs are they?

B.97:  Well, one of them is part Great Dane, in fact we think she's mostly Great
Dane, but, um --

A.98:  Oh.

B.99:  -- we found her.  And then the second dog, she looks black Lab, we found
her too, and --

A.100:  Oh.

B.101:  -- so, uh, we got a bunch of strays running around the house.

A.102:  [Laughter] My husband has a little cocker spaniel that walks with him --

B.103:  Oh.

A.104:  -- when he, when he's here, when he doesn't, you know, he walks at the
University of Utah a lot too, but he's, he, uh, walks here and takes the dog
with her, with him.

B.105:  Is he a professor out there?

A.106:  No, no, he's an educational specialist.

B.107:  What kind of, what, uh, what does that mean?

A.108:  Well, he is a civilian employee of the Army, and he just, uh, tests, uh,
universities and the high schools to place students where they'd like to be --

B.109:  Oh, I see.

A.110:  -- if they join the Army.

B.111:  Uh-huh.

A.112:  Or even if they don't, they can still take the test [laughter].

B.113:  [Laughter]  Have all your kids left home?

A.114:  Ye-, well, yes.  

B.115:  Uh-huh.
