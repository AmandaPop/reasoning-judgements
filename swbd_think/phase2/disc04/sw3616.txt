A.1:  Okay, it's what movies have you seen lately and which,

@B.2:  Well, uh, we just saw J F K, uh, like yesterday.

A.3:  Oh did you?

B.4:  Yeah and,

A.5:  Did you like it?

B.6:  Yeah, um, I'm a big Oliver Stone fan, I mean, so, anything he does, I mean,
I like, but yeah, have you seen it yet?

A.7:  No, I haven't.  

B.8:  I mean, you know, it's just about the assassination and everything so.

A.9:  Is it just more or less the things that we've seen and heard before?

B.10:  Well, what, some of you have heard, some of you haven't, I think, it's
just, it's, it's pretty much every, it's the most plausible theory that, I
guess, um, theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a, um, pretty
much an order, pretty much, I don't know, it's kind of hard to describe, I
mean it's kind, uh, you have to kind of see it, because it wasn't what I
expected, because I was thinking it's going to be just kind of a typical
rundown of what, you know, you've heard the past, you know, ten years --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- but, um, I think it's a great movie because, uh, you leave the, uh,
movie thinking that, you know, the government actually was,

A.13:  Involved in it.

B.14:  They, they, yeah, I mean --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- they, you know, they did, there's always that coverup and that was in
sixty, you know, sixty-three, so, I mean, uh, twenty-eight years later there's
been, there's so much more that they've done, I mean, to screw the American
people around, so it's, it's a great movie --

A.17:  Uh-huh, I,

B.18:  -- and, my family's in, act-, my family's here tonight, um, and they're
wanting to see it, so I'm probably going to go see it again, and I'm not one,
I usually don't like to see a movie, you know, twice, but if it's, gee, that's
a three hour and like twenty minute movie, and --

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  -- I mean, I want to see it again.  It's a great movie.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  It's really good.

A.23:  Oh, well, we, we, uh, most of our movies are, we rent them --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- because, uh, my husband and I are the only ones left home, so we just
rent the movies, and the last one we saw was HOME ALONE --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- and I just loved it.

B.28:  Yeah, that's a good movie, I saw that last year --

A.29:  Yeah, well, my --

B.30:  -- when it came around.

A.31:  -- my, even my grandchildren like it.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  So, it-, it's been a good movie and we've, we've really, uh, we've, in fact
we bought the video --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- so, uh, is there any others that you especially stand out that you like?

B.36:  Yeah, I've seen, uh, saw BUGSY and, uh.

A.37:  Oh was that good?

B.38:  That's a good movie, yeah.

A.39:  That was on the, the racketeers, wasn't it?

B.40:  What's that?

A.41:  That was on the racketeering --

B.42:  Yeah, yeah, that, um.

A.43:  -- and the twenties.

B.44:  Right it's about, uh, (( )) who pretty much started Flamingo out in Vegas.
He had like --

A.45:  That's right.

B.46:  -- the vision of, you know, Vegas, what it could be, what it is today.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  At the time, it was, you know, just a complete desert and --

A.49:  They built it on a,

B.50:  -- pretty much, yeah, he had, he was given a budget of like a million
dollars to go out and build this Flamingo, and they thought he was cra-, it
was a stupid idea.  And, you know, he built it, but it cost like six million
dollars because he had so many overruns, you know.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  I mean, there was nothing out there, and they thought, you know, it was
stupid.  So he got killed for it because, you know, he,

A.53:  He never did live to see the --

B.54:  Right, and --

A.55:  -- uh-huh.

B.56:  -- you know, the great thing is, you know, his six million dollar
investment turned out to be a two hundred billion dollar return, so.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  And they killed him, because they didn't think it was going to work out,
but, yeah, it's a great movie, it's a good movie.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  (( )) did a good job, and, I've seen, uh, gol, what else, oh, I'm trying to
think.

A.61:  Do you go to a lot of movies?

B.62:  Uh, lately I've just seen, this past week or so, because I'm, uh, I had a
coup-, past couple weeks off.  So saw couple of movies.  We just saw BUGSY and
J F K like in a two day period, so that was one thing, and, I can't think of
anything else I've seen lately.  I mean, I, I, I'm a big movie fan, so, I
mean, I usually rent them too.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  But.

A.65:  Well, we, we really,

B.66:  CAPE FEAR, that was another movie I saw.  CAPE FEAR'S real good.  (( )).

A.67:  Oh, have you seen that one?  

B.68:  Yeah, that's a great movie.

A.69:  You've see a lot of the latest ones, haven't you.

B.70:  Yeah, I'm a big Martin (( )) fan, so.

A.71:  Oh, did you see, uh, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST?

B.72:  No, I hadn't seen that yet, but, uh, I'm prob-, I guess I prob-, I probably
will.  These, at first, you know, you think of animation as a cartoon that's
kind of a kid film but --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- but, the more I've heard, I'm, I had a couple of friends actually saw it
and says it's a pretty good film, but.  Um, I, you know, I'll probably get
around to seeing it.

A.75:  Do you have children?

B.76:  No, I'm --

A.77:  Oh.

B.78:  -- I'm twenty-three, but I got a girl friend.  She's big time.

A.79:  Oh.

B.80:  She's been begging me to go, you know, I want to BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  
So,

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  I,

A.83:  So you'll probably take her and go.

B.84:  Yeah, so.

A.85:  Uh-huh. We were, we're going to that tomorrow and take our grandchildren.
So.
