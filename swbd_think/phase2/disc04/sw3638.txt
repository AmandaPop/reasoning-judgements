========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, uh, the Cowboys are my favorite team.  That's pretty easy to say
nowadays [laughter].

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  Lot easier than it was a couple years ago, but they had a big win today.
Uh, did you get to watch it?

B.4:  No, I didn't.  I, uh, have been at my computer all day so,

A.5:  Oh.  Are you a Cowboy fan?  

B.6:  Well, I used to be a real big Cowboy fan and, and, uh, I'm not a Jimmy
Johnson fan.

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  [Laughter] Being an Okie [laughter] -- 

A.9:  Right, yeah.  

B.10:  -- I just really don't care much, uh, it's, it's kind of hard not to be a
Cowboy fan, though.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  They've always been, you know, my favorite.  

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  But, uh, and -- 

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- and I guess I still have a soft spot.  I just hate that that's the coach
[laughter] --

A.17:  Right.  

B.18:  -- that's leading them.  

A.19:  Right.  

B.20:  So, now have they, they're in the playoffs, right?  

A.21:  Yeah, they made it to the playoffs finally like just, you know, two years
ago they were one and fifteen.  They won like just one game and so pretty fast
turnaround.  But this year they made it to playoffs and today was the first
game and they beat the Chicago Bears so everybody's really going crazy, you
know, down here.

B.22:  I'll bet they are.  

A.23:  [Laughter] They're going crazy, so, so they turned it around, but, you
know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, uh, I mean, everybody was
real upset, you know, when they fired Tom Landry, but, you know, now it's
like, you know, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten [laughter] about
that.

B.24:  Uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  Hit a bad season and it's, you know, the coach's fault, let's, let's dump
him.

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  First good season, the coach can do no wrong.  

A.29:  Right, exactly.  

B.30:  But they -- 

A.31:  You know.  

B.32:  -- Dallas has always been good ahead, you know, heading good players and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- both running, running backs and, and defense.  

A.35:  Right, yeah, uh, you know, they have a young team.  It's, you know, a lot
different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old, you know,
players every year and, you know, same coach, same everything, so, now it's,
you know, like a taste of something different.  They're all not, you know,
mister nice guys like they used to be.

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  Now it's like, you know, tough and dirty team so everybody is really
excited.  And,

B.38:  Who is the competition going to be?  

A.39:  Well, it's supposed to be the Redskins, but you know, we beat them already.
We beat them this year in, in Washington so, you know, so everybody has the
feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl, but, you know, it's just
that we have to play every game away, you know, it's going to be tough, but,
but every-, the competition is, are teams that they've already beat this year,
so, I mean, Atlanta, they're in it, too, and we beat them and, uh, see,
Detroit, we play them next week, but, you know, we should beat them.
Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so, it's, so everything's,
uh, looking real good.

B.40:  Course, I think, you know, you can't really go by what happened earlier in
the season --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- because teams jell together or they've had -- 

A.43:  Right.  

B.44:  -- injuries that heal and, you know -- 

A.45:  Right.  

B.46:  -- it can be a tot-, or injuries that, uh, have newly happened --

A.47:  Right.  

B.48:  -- and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one we
played.

A.49:  Yeah, well the Cowboys are on a roll.  They've won, like, I think six or
seven in a row now, so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the, in the
league going into the playoffs so,

B.50:  But, but since you have an O U drop out [laughter] as a quarterback,

A.51:  Right, yeah, Troy Aikman, he got hurt at O U, so he transferred --

B.52:  Well,

A.53:  -- to U C L A. 

B.54:  Well, he, he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at
O U.

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  O U has always been known for their running game.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  More than,

A.59:  They're playing tonight in fact.  

B.60:  Right.  

A.61:  I'm watching them on T V right now.  But they're doing some stomping on
[laughter] Virginia.

B.62:  Oh, I tell you, they've, they've not had much of a team this year, bless
their little hearts [laughter].

A.63:  Really?  Well, they're doing good tonight.  

B.64:  Are they?  

A.65:  Yeah -- 

B.66:  I haven't -- 

A.67:  -- they're winning.  

B.68:  -- been watching.  

A.69:  They're winning forty-one to seven.  

B.70:  Well, good -- 

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  -- for us [laughter].  

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  Oh. 

A.75:  But, yeah, and, uh, that's right, Aikman did go to O U.  I forgot about
that.

B.76:  Yeah, they h-, then he went out to S, to southern Cal.  Is that where he
went?

A.77:  Yeah, uh, U C L A. 

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  So,

A.81:  But, the Cowboys did good today.  I mean, I was proud.  I thought, I
thought they would get beat today because, I mean they're so young, you know,
playoffs,
