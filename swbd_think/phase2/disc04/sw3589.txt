=====================================================================

A.1:  Well, my view, I work for a financial institution and --

B.2:  Oh, boy [laughter].

A.3:  -- yeah, and I love my credit card.  Uh, you end up with more consumer
rights by using credit cards than, 

B.4:  What do you mean by that?

A.5:  Uh, what I mean is, say you pay for something with a check.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Your check clears, you're out the bucks.  You pay for something with a
credit card, you are dissatisfied with it, you take it back and they say
sorry, we, you can't take it back.  If, you know, you can leave it there and
then just have your Visa charge back.

B.8:  Oh.

A.9:  Get your money back.

B.10:  What's your favorite credit card do you use?

A.11:  Visa.

B.12:  Visa.  How come?

A.13:  Well, that's the kind we offer [laughter].

B.14:  Oh, that's a good reason, that's a good reason.  

A.15:  And, uh, we're just offering a, a new card that gives you on-, up to one
percent back of all the charges that you make --

B.16:  How?

A.17:  -- cash back, you know, like Discovers.

B.18:  I was going to say, I know Discover does that.

A.19:  And we're starting to do that.

B.20:  Visa's going to do it too?

A.21:  We are.

B.22:  Who-, all right, who puts out your Visa card?

A.23:  Uh, we do.

B.24:  Who's we?

A.25:  America First Credit Union.

B.26:  America First Credit Union, and you're going to offer the cash back, just
like Discover does, huh?

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Well, I, I'll tell you, that works, because I use my Discover card more
than any other credit card for that sole reason.

A.29:  Did you get much back?

B.30:  Um, [throat_clearing] yeah [laughter].

A.31:  Well, good for you, that must mean, 

B.32:  Unfortunately, I use my Discover card more than I ought to.  Not a great
deal, I get, I get a ba-, a check for about fifty some bucks at the end of the
year usually.

A.33:  And it's one percent, so you spend about five thousand.

B.34:  Yeah [laughter].

A.35:  That's pretty good.

B.36:  I shouldn't tell that to you.

A.37:  Well, I, I do better than that.  Everything goes on mine, and then I've got
a business too, that I use it for charging computers on.

B.38:  Well, I tell you, then, then I have an exact account of everything I've
bought.

A.39:  It is nice.

B.40:  It's all printed out.

A.41:  Yep.

B.42:  As long as you keep your statements, then you know exactly what you've
spent and if, you know, when you bought something, because often I won't
remember, and I can go back, you know, I remember the month, so I can go back
to my, my credit card invoice and there it is.  It tells me the exact date and
everything.

A.43:  Well, how many cards have you got?

B.44:  Well, I have a whole slew of the them, but I really, I use, I have a 
Visa --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- uh, but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit, from my --

A.47:  Uh-huh, a debit card.

B.48:  -- yes.  And so,   

A.49:  I don't like those.

B.50:  I don't either, because it's gone, although they don't debit it until the
end of the month.

A.51:  Oh, really?

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  That's interesting.

B.54:  Um, but it still automatically comes off that month.  If I time it right,
then any, like, my, my date is the twelfth --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- so if I charge something on the thirteenth, then I don't get that bill
until the end of the month, and it's not due until before the twelfth of the
next month.  So I can put off paying for something for free for two months.

A.57:  With a debit card.

B.58:  No, not with a debit card.

A.59:  Oh, credit.

B.60:  With my Discover card I can.

A.61:  Oh, okay.

B.62:  And I use Discover more than any other because of the cash back.  I have
MasterCard and then I have all the different department stores, but I just
really never use them.  And I try desperately hard to pay it off each month --

A.63:  Yes.

B.64:  -- because the cost to use it is terrific.

A.65:  Is it twenty percent interest?

B.66:  Uh, it varies from eighteen and a half to twenty-one percent.

A.67:  Wow.

B.68:  And that's, that's tremendous amount.

A.69:  Our card's thirteen and a half --

B.70:  Oh, you're kidding me.

A.71:  -- with a ten dollar annual fee.

B.72:  How do you get one of yours?

A.73:  Well, you have to be a member of our credit union.

B.74:  And what credit union is that?

A.75:  America First.  It's, we're the,

B.76:  Oh, but see, you're in Utah.

A.77:  Yeah #yeah# --

B.78:  #Yeah.#

A.79:  -- you have to a resident of this state.

B.80:  Oh, okay.  I was thinking about your brother.  He said, Jack (( )) but
that's, you're nowhere near us.  Wow.  That's a neat idea, that perhaps some
other people around here will catch on and do it too.

A.81:  Uh, do you have Mervyn's and all those?

B.82:  Oh, yeah.

A.83:  Have you noticed that they all have started issuing their own credit cards?

B.84:  Oh, yeah, they have for years, but you can still use the three big ones,
MasterCard, Visa, and now Discover.  You can still use those three, um, at
almost any department store.

A.85:  What do you think of Dis-, uh, Sears not taking any one but theirs?

B.86:  They have not done that for years.

A.87:  Yeah.  Do you like that or do you think that's fair or,

B.88:  I don't know, I used, when I was a, a kid [laughter], I worked for Sears.

A.89:  Oh.

B.90:  And, it, I'm just, I'm so used to them not taking anybody but theirs.
They'll take Discover, but see, they back Discover, too.

A.91:  Yeah, it's theirs.

B.92:  So it doesn't bother me because I use Discover most of the time.

A.93:  Oh, okay.  Let's see.  Do you think that, uh, the move towards plastic is a
good thing?

B.94:  I think it,
