========================================================================

A.1:  [Throat_clearing]  Well down here, we've got, um, trials by, uh, jury in
criminal cases and the sentencing can be done by the jury normally, although
the judge can sometimes do it.  How do you all do it up there?

B.2:  Uh, we usually do it, uh, the jury comes to the verdict and then the judge
does the sentencing.  Um, I think the jury can recommend something, but in,
you know, in some cases like, uh, murder in the first degree, but I, the
ultimate decision is the, is the decision of the judge.  Once the verdict has
been reached the jury is dismissed, and there's a separate hearing for
sentencing.

A.3:  We've got a lot of (( )), in federal court they have a uniform sentencing
guidelines that pretty well leave it up to the, uh, judge to assess the
punishment in a certain range.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  Well, I think it's curious that the sentences that are handed down
are usually not served.  I think that's a big problem with the criminal
justice system, but.

A.5:  Right here, in the Dallas area, if you are sentenced to ten years or less
to incarceration in, in the, uh, penitentiary, you will never make it to the
penitentiary and you'll serve about a year in the county jail and then be
released because of the jail overcrowding.

B.6:  Yeah.  Well, I, I understand the jail overcrowding issue, but I, I think
in, in that case as in so many all they ever do is discuss the problems and
they never do anything to solve them.  I think that's why this country's in
the shape it's in now.  But I, I don't really believe that a jury should do
the sentencing.  I think,

A.7:  Well, the judge has a better idea what is probable ranges for that
particular type of offense where a jury is just doing it for one time.

B.8:  Yeah, I just don't believe that jurors have the, the knowledge, the scope
and the knowledge to, to handle the sentencing, whereas the judge does.

A.9:  (( )) in civil cases they can have as few as ten of the jury agree on a
verdict, but criminal normally requires unanimous.  They might make a change
on that, that might make for fewer mistrials.

B.10:  That's, that's certainly true.  I just, I, I don't agree with juries doing
the sentencing, but I do agree with trial, trial by jury.  I just think that's
critical.

A.11:  There's some civil cases trial by jury that wouldn't necessarily work if
you have a big, complex, uh, business type case where a jury could get totally
lost.  In a lot of those cases people decide to just try the case before a
judge and just not have a jury.

B.12:  Right.  Well, I think that can, that makes sense too, because it looks like
it would be awfully hard to pick jurors that could follow something as in a
civil case, I mean, that was really complicated and had a lot of technical
issues in it, but they, there are a lot of criminal cases, a lot of murder
cases that, that are really very complicated, and they seem to be able to get
through those.

A.13:  You had up there in North Carolina that case of that lady who poisoning her
various husbands, what was it, Blanchard or,

B.14:  Blanche Taylor Moore.

A.15:  Blanche, yeah.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  We, we've been reading about that.

B.18:  Yeah, we, have you have you heard about the trial that we've got going on
now with the, uh, the man that's accused of molesting twenty-three children at
a day care center?

A.19:  No. I don't remember reading about that.

B.20:  Well, that's the, uh, that's probably one of the biggest child molestation
cases in the, in the nation's history.  This man and his wife, it's a trial by
jury, but it's really going real ragged.  I don't understand how they're doing
it, and they, he had a hundred and seventy eight charges against him, and his
attorney's managed to get it reduced to ninety-three, but the jury in that
case, they've just absolutely sequestered them.  Nobody even, unless you were
paying attention at the very beginning, you don't even know their names, and
they, uh, from what I've been reading in the paper, they are the ones who are
going to do the sentencing in that.

A.21:  We've got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife
with arsenic, and the jury, the case went to the jury today, and the jury's
deliberating right now.

B.22:  Arsenic is, uh, this, this Blanche Taylor Moore woman was very clever.  She
did it very slowly over a large period, a long period of time.  At least it
was, it was done very slowly over a large period of time, and since the jury
has found her guilty, now the judge did the sentencing in that, and she's
appealing, but I'm assuming that she's guilty, because I really believe in the
jury system.

A.23:  Well, the collective wisdom of the jury usually prevails.

B.24:  Yeah.  Hopefully they're smart enough not to be hoodwinked by legal ploys
by lawyers and prosecutors,
