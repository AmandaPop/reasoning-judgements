A.1:  Yes.  

B.2:  Do you rely on newspapers or T V or what for your -- 

A.3:  Well, uh,

B.4:  -- current events?  

A.5:  Mostly the radio.  I listen to the radio.  I'm home during the day and so I
have the radio going and listen to the news there and then, uh, I watch the
news on T V at night.  We have a local newspaper that we subscribe to but
that's, uh, all the newspaper.  My husband and I used to take the, the WALL
STREET JOURNAL and that had a lot of good information.

B.6:  Are you in Salt Lake City?  

A.7:  We're fifty miles north.  

B.8:  So you're a suburb of it, then.  

A.9:  Right, right.

B.10:  Okay.

A.11:  So we don't take the Salt Lake newspaper.  How about,

B.12:  We have, we have in Dallas what's called talk radio.  

A.13:  Oh, yes.  

B.14:  And it's news twenty-four hours a day.  

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  You don't listen to it [laughter] twenty-four hours.  

A.17:  [Laughter]. 

B.18:  If you're in the car for twenty minutes in traffic, you sure get a bunch of
news real quick.

A.19:  Get caught up on it fast.  

B.20:  So you primarily -- 

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  -- rely on, on the radio.  

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  Yes, and we have, uh, the station we listen to is out of K-, or out of Salt
Lake City and it's an all news or an all talk station also.  It doesn't have
the, the music and the,

B.26:  Do you have where these people call in, express their opinions and talk
back?

A.27:  Yes.  

B.28:  Yeah -- 

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- same thing down here.  It's, uh, really gets some really neat
information that way don't we.

A.31:  Right, get a lot of different, different viewpoints [laughter].  Because
you have,

B.32:  I definitely take the morning newspaper and read the headlines of --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- every morning and,

A.35:  And that helps keep up on, too.  

B.36:  I,

A.37:  How about magazines?  Do you take any magazines?  

B.38:  At the office, nothing newsworthy, uh,

A.39:  Oh. 

B.40:  Uh, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, READER'S DIGEST.  

A.41:  Oh. 

B.42:  Uh, I'm afraid we're probably reliant on newspapers and radio. 

A.43:  Right, uh,

B.44:  Television news, I'm not interested in their, in them.  

A.45:  Right, that, you don't like the television news, the television reports.

B.46:  Uh, no, I don't.  Uh, especially the in depth things like SIXTY MINUTES.

A.47:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.48:  Or, or whatever else they c-, I think they're very biased.  

A.49:  They are, right.  

B.50:  Uh,

A.51:  Presents one viewpoint -- 

B.52:  Uh,

A.53:  -- and not the other.  

B.54:  Journalistic, uh, they'll go into some guy's office with T V cameras
rolling and --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- because he sticks up his hand, doesn't want to be seen, he's c-, he's
supposed to be considered guilty.

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  They're char-, they're making a man look guilty before he's even given a
chance to hear his side of the story but,

A.59:  Well, you know, I think there's a lot of that in the newspaper reporting,
too.  #I think,#

B.60:  #[Laughter]#  Definitely [laughter].  

A.61:  Because a lot, and I don't know how much of what we read is, is really
accurate.  A few of the stories that, that, you know, I've been personably,
person, known what's going on and then you read what's in the newspaper about
it and it doesn't always match up.  So,

B.62:  You really wonder what you hear from this Russia thing that going on.  Is,
is Yeltsin all that great.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  You know, is he really going to, it sounds as more and more came out that
he and, what's his name is gone now --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- Gorbachev. 

A.67:  Gorbachev, yeah.  

B.68:  Gorbachev, got into a political quarrel about three years ago --

A.69:  Oh. 

B.70:  -- and, uh, Gorbachev just got beat to the punch politically. 

A.71:  Oh. 

B.72:  And I mean even with a guy, Gorbachev goes to his office to clean out his
desk for the next day [laughter] --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- and Yeltsin is already there sitting there [laughter].  

A.75:  [Laughter]. 

B.76:  Oh, that's ugly.  

A.77:  Uh, it is, and, and like you say, we r-, I'm really not sure how much of
what we hear is reliable.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  We, uh, my family and I went out, we have a golden spike, uh, railroad
monument.  Oh, it's probably about fifty miles from here.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  Last Friday we went out there to watch the train come in, the steam engine
and there was, uh, there was probably a group of, oh, maybe fifty to
seventy-five people out there and the newspaper reporter was there and he took
a picture and it was in the paper the next day and it,

B.82:  Hundreds.  

A.83:  N-, [laughter] well, just the opposite, they probably had, oh, ten people
in the picture and he said, uh, just a small group had turned out to watch the
steam engine come in and the way it was printed and the way the picture was,
it looked like that was all there was was right there when there was --

B.84:  I'll be dad gummed.  

A.85:  -- quite, quite a few more there, you know.  

B.86:  Um.  

A.87:  So, I think you have to be careful when, when we take in the information,
what we take as truth and what we don't.

B.88:  We lost the second major newspaper in Dallas within this month.

A.89:  [Breathing] Oh, I read that.  

B.90:  The DALLAS TIMES HERALD -- 

A.91:  Yes.  

B.92:  -- went under.  We were one of the few, few cities remaining, big cities
that had two papers.  And --

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  -- and we're sorry t-, now, you got the FORT WORTH PRESS and, uh --

A.95:  Oh. 

B.96:  -- uh, no FORT WORTH STAR TELEGRAM.  The PRESS went years ago and the
DALLAS MORNING NEWS and,

A.97:  Oh, was it financial trouble, and that's what they went under for --

B.98:  Yep.  

A.99:  -- wasn't it?  

B.100:  Yep, competition -- 

A.101:  Oh. 

B.102:  -- killed them and, and then, well, the MORNING NEWS finally bought out
the, the HERALD.

A.103:  Oh. 

B.104:  And, of course, closed it down [laughter].  

A.105:  Yes, oh, well, that's, that's too bad, which one did, did you subscribe to
that one or,

B.106:  Oh, I've been with the DALLAS MORNING NEWS for twenty years. 

A.107:  Oh, oh. 

B.108:  It is the conservative paper and I'm probably lean to being conservative --

A.109:  Uh-huh.  

B.110:  -- as opposed to liberal.  

A.111:  Uh-huh.  

B.112:  So,

A.113:  Oh. 

B.114:  And the other was kind of the liberal paper so,

A.115:  Oh, huh.  Well that,

B.116:  So I feel sorry for all the liberals in town.  They have to,

A.117:  [Laughter]. 

B.118:  read the good stuff now [laughter]. 

A.119:  Oh yes, well that's,

B.120:  [Sniffing]. 

A.121:  I think Tom and I think, uh,

B.122:  The children,
