========================================================================

A.1:  Um, what do you feel about child care?

B.2:  Well, fortunately, my children are pretty much beyond that [laughter].

A.3:  Mine are too, 

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  but I think it's a real, re-, a real serious situation for a lot of
people.

B.6:  It certainly is.

A.7:  And I, don't you know a lot about it wh-, where you're working for this
school department?

B.8:  Yes, um, our Y M C A has after school child care, um, at several of the
schools, so that they don't even have to --

A.9:  #Leave the school.#

B.10:  -- #you know# --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- go any where, yeah, um, and then for other schools that they don't have
it at the school, they have it at the Y --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and they pick them up in a, a, you know, a van or whatever.  I think it
kind of depends on how many students.

A.15:  Well, you're probably in a more, uh, oh, we, we live in a ru-, rural 
area --

B.16:  Oh, okay.

A.17:  -- and so I think most of the people around here that have to leave their
children leave them with, uh, neighbors or --

B.18:  #Uh-huh.#

A.19:  -- #people,# you know, in a home situation.

B.20:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.21:  So.

B.22:  Well, that's always nice, too.  I did that when mine were, were littler.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  The first couple of years that I, I worked only halftime when my first
child was born, and, and he just stayed with a friend, or somebody that maybe
had one child, you know, his age.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Um [throat_clearing] and that always seemed to work out real well and you
know, when somebody would decide to quit or something, I always felt real
panicky [laughter].

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  But, I always seemed to manage to find somebody that I felt was just as
wonderful as the other one, you know.

A.29:  [Laughter] Yeah.  #Did you,# 

B.30:  #So it# seemed to work out.

A.31:  Have you worked all the time your children were little?

B.32:  Um, uh, when I had my second one I stayed home for three and a half 
years --

A.33:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and then, and then went back.

A.35:  So, that's about the time then they could go into a preschool situation.

B.36:  Right, #right.#  

A.37:  #Oh.#

B.38:  Unfortunately the preschool that I wanted the second one to go to, because
my first one had, is a preschool that does not have any day care at all
[laughter].

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  But it's such a wonderful preschool, so I had to find somebody else to keep
them and then, and then somebody to take them there.

A.41:  Oh.

B.42:  So that's always another problem.

A.43:  Oh, yes.  You know, I don't know how people, we-, it's pretty cold here in
Utah in the winter --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and I, I just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up, a
baby --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning.

B.48:  Right, yeah.

A.49:  I think that that, I would, I think I would sooner have it in, someone in
the home taking care of it.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  But then that's awfully expensive, too.

A.51:  In a home?

B.52:  Ye-, well, I mean, if so you have someone come into your home.

A.53:  Oh, yes, uh-huh, to come into your home.

B.54:  That would be real nice --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- but just almost, almost cost prohibitive, prohibitive, you know.

A.57:  Yes, unless you can get, could get a, a nanny or something that, I know a
lot of the girls here go off as nannies --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and stay in people's homes and take care of them after they've graduated
from high school.

B.60:  Oh.

A.61:  Not a lot but some of them.

B.62:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.63:  But, uh, I think that'd be an ideal situation.  I've never had to, to, uh,
work out of the home.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  I've had, we had, uh, six children, and they just, I would just, I was just
here with them.

B.66:  Well, you just worked, period, huh [laughter] --

A.67:  Right [laughter].

B.68:  -- if you had six children [laughter].

A.69:  Right.  Well there was seventeen years between them but, 

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  that, uh, I just, I just really, that's what I wanted to do --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- you know, and, but I know that my children's spouses and, I have five
boys and a girl --

B.74:  Oh [laughter].

A.75:  -- and, uh,

B.76:  Where did the girl come?

A.77:  In the middle.

B.78:  Middle [laughter].

A.79:  Uh-huh, we kept trying [laughter].

B.80:  [Laughter] Oh, that's good.

A.81:  But, uh, the, our, our dau-, or none of them have worked very much while
their children have been little.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  So, but, uh, we have fourteen grandchildren so, 

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  I, I feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home.

B.86:  Right.

A.87:  Because, I, I, I don't know, I just think that those first two or three
years, and again in high school, that they need their mother there.

B.88:  Yeah, that's true, it's true.

A.89:  So.

B.90:  Well, how cold is it up there?

A.91:  Uh, it's in the, How, cold is it, Honey, right now?  About twenty-eight.

B.92:  Oh, okay.  Well, it's about fifty here, so.

A.93:  Is it still raining?

B.94:  Uh, no, it's quit. 

A.95:  Oh, good.

B.96:  Yeah. 

A.97:  Are you,

B.98:  It was bad there for a little bit, but, uh,

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  Anyway.

A.101:  What do you do in the school district?  Do you,

B.102:  I'm a librarian.

A.103:  Oh, well that'd be interesting.  

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  I love books [laughter].

B.106:  Yeah, I like that a lot. 

A.107:  So.

B.108:  And I kind of wanted to continue it, even though my children were, you
know, when they were born but,

A.109:  Uh-huh.

B.110:  Like I said, I was able to stay home for those three years, so, it made a
difference.

A.111:  Well I think if you're trained and I think if you feel it within yourself
that you want to be out, you know, and you have, uh, you have the ability and
stuff, that's great.

B.112:  Uh-huh.

A.113:  There were times when I would have loved to have got, you know,

B.114:  To get out.  #Yeah, that's true I think.#

A.115:  #Uh-huh, to have left my kids and,# you know,

B.116:  Everybody feels that way at times, at least.

A.117:  I'm sure they do.

B.118:  And then also, that you'd love to be home --

A.119:  I'm sure that's so too.

B.120:  -- at, at other times, but, uh, one thing I think it does do, is it, it, it
forces, [sniffing] it forces you to make your children be organized and --

A.121:  And I think it makes them more independent.

B.122:  -- and independent, that's right.

A.123:  Uh-huh.
