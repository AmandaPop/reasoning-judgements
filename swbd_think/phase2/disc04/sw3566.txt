=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay, we're ready to begin.

B.2:  Okay.  Uh, okay, one of the things they said about how you feel about
putting an elderly person in a nursing home.

A.3:  Yeah.

@B.4:  Um, I've had that situation presented to me personally about three years
ago when I had to put my, place my dad in a nursing home.

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  And, um, he had Alzheimer's, and he, uh, wandered, and I had to put him in
there for his own safety, because I could not, I couldn't care for him here
any longer.  I tried as hard as I could.

A.7:  Is that pretty much a full-time care situation, isn't it?  

B.8:  Yes, and, uh, I had to work, and he would get up in the middle of the night
and he could get out and wander down the street, and I was afraid for his
safety.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  Um, and so I had to make that decision.  Um,

A.11:  Did you, did you, uh, check into, um, a lot of different facilities and --

B.12:  Yes, I did.

A.13:  -- see what kind of care they offered?

B.14:  I checked into the facilities.  The other thing that I did, and I recommend
other people to do this same thing sometimes, is to check and with people that
have family members in that nursing facility, you know, see if you can find
out who, who has a family member there, or if you go and check it, stop and
ask somebody when you see them, you know, do you have, you know, what relative
do you have here --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- uh, how is the care, are you satisfied.  Um, it took me quite a while to
choose.

A.17:  Did you find there was a large range of costs involved in, in nursing
homes?

B.18:  Yes.  Very much so.  There was a large range of costs, uh, and the cost
didn't necessarily reflect the care.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  The cost, some of the costs went for other amenities for those that were,
uh, up and ambulatory, like really nice dining rooms and, you know, uh, things
like that, but that was for one segment, but then the other segment that
needed full nursing care I didn't feel I got the benefit of the extra cost.

A.21:  Is that, that's what I'm, I'm thinking.  Uh, my mother right now is, is
able to care for herself --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and, uh, I was interested in looking, uh, for something that would have
a, a range of care, I guess, so that --

B.24:  Right --

A.25:  -- you know.

B.26:  -- and you would want the, maybe, the, uh, extra amenities, you know, like
the very nice dining room, and, you know, the freedom of the grounds to be
nice so they can walk out there, and, you know, activities she would,

A.27:  Yeah, organized activities.

B.28:  Uh, organized activities, and things like that.

A.29:  The ones I saw for more, uh, uh, care, I, I assumed that they have certain
requirements for their, uh, nursing and medical staff, uh, some --

B.30:  Ri-,

A.31:  -- sort of state requirements.

B.32:  Right, yeah, each state is different, but, uh, here in Texas there are
certain, you know, requirements.

A.33:  Yeah.  Is there, um, uh, did you find there was a waiting list for some of
them, or, to get into?

B.34:  Some of them, yes, there was a waiting list.  

A.35:  (( )).

B.36:  Um, in fact, I had one, when I first started I went through a series of,
see I had my dad in two different nursing homes.  When I first started he was
in one that wasn't total, total patient care, but, where he could be watched
but he had the freedom to wander around and, and help caring for himself, but
he could do, you know, he could feed himself, he could do things for himself.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Um, and I had him on a waiting list there, then he got so that he c-, they
could not handle him at that level, and they didn't have a higher level at
that facility, which I really didn't think of, you know --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- when I checked him in.  Uh, so then I had to go and se-, I had to start
all over again.

A.41:  Do you know whether or not, uh, some of the, uh, programs such as a, uh,
Medicaid, uh, help fund any of the costs involved in, in elderly care?

B.42:  Uh, Medicaid will under certain circumstances.  Medicare will, again,
under, you have to be discharged from the hospital and for so many days, uh,
Medicare will, like I said, under certain circumstances.  My dad did not, was
not eligible for Medicaid, and Medicare would not cover Alzheimer's.

A.43:  Okay, so there's, there's, uh --

B.44:  So that,

A.45:  -- some things they'll cover and some they won't.

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  Okay.

B.48:  It almost goes by case by case.

A.49:  Yeah.  Uh, that's, uh, that's something I think many people have to address
at some point or other, and, and, uh, it's a tough decision to make --

B.50:  It is.

A.51:  -- especially depending on your, the care that is needed, and, and, uh, uh,
in today's life more and more children really can't, with working, both
couples working, it gets almost impossible to do that at home anymore.

B.52:  It, it does and,
