A.1:  Brian.

B.2:  Hi, I'm Rita, from Garland.

A.3:  Oh, nice to meet you, Rita.

B.4:  Uh, we have quite a in-depth subject here, don't we?

A.5:  Yeah, we do [laughter].

B.6:  Why couldn't we get something simple like movies or books, something more,
more fun.

A.7:  Exactly, some of these boring ones, you just kind of babble on, I guess
[laughter].

B.8:  Yeah, well, we will, we'll just give them lots of talk about, won't we?

A.9:  All right, we ready to give it a shot?

B.10:  Yeah, that's right.

A.11:  All right.  [Beep] Okay.

@B.12:  Okay, well, uh, I have a business of my own --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and I feel pretty strongly about it.  I don't mind being drug tested,
and I don't feel the employee should.

A.15:  Yeah, I agree with that --

B.16:  Now, you know.

A.17:  -- I think, especially in some of the, the jobs that the government has,
you just need people who are, you know, who are sober all the time to take
care of them.  You know, you're paying them to do a certain job, and if
they're, they're on drugs and doing things they're not supposed to be doing.

B.18:  No, I, I, you know, I think sometimes that when you fly, for example, you
know, pilots and things like that or --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- people, um, that are even using, uh, automated equipment of some kind
where another person could be injured, you know --

A.21:  Absolutely.

B.22:  -- you know, and, uh, well, a lot of times I think it depends upon the
occasion, but, you know, I've never had any problem with being drug tested,
and I wouldn't think that other people should have either.  I guess that's
sort of a personal opinion [laughter].

A.23:  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think part of the things that you do when you
apply for a job is you, you know, you tell them that you're going to do a
certain type of work and be a certain type of person, and, you know, I think
part of that is living the law.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  I know if I had my own company I'd want people who are honest in all
they're doing, so.

B.26:  Well, I have a private high school, and, uh, we get permission from the
parents before the children, the students enroll --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- to allow random drug testing, because I've seen what can happen to
youngsters who were not on drugs being around it and getting influenced by
their peers who are.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  And there's a lot of it in the public school system.

A.31:  Oh, absolutely.  I's, I went to school in Plano when I was growing up, and
just, I don't know, it was [laughter] I was surprised how much of it was
there.

B.32:  Yeah, and of course good kids try to stay away from it, but I've seen kids
start out not being on drugs and end up being there because it was being sold
right out un-, under their noses, you know.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  So, uh, you know, I feel pretty strongly about it.  I, you know, I know
that there are people that say we're violating their civil rights and what
have you, but they don't have to enroll [laughter].

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  You know, they don't have to take that job if that's the way they feel
about it.

A.37:  Yeah, and I think the second part to that is, you know, they are also
violating civil rights when they're using these illegal drugs.

B.38:  Yeah, that's right.  They're violating ours, you know.

A.39:  Yeah.  And I think, you know, personally I, the way I feel about it is it's
a lot better that we go ahead and, and help these people, you know, that when
we find that they are, they're using drugs that we help them to get over that
so they can be good peo-, or not necessary, I'm not saying they're bad people,
but they can be productive people.

B.40:  Well, they can be more productive and more useful.  Yeah, I feel that way
too.  We don't, uh, kick them out, we ask, we call parents in if, we haven't
had one test positive yet, but, if it did, we call parents in and, uh, you
know, get help for them --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- before it's too late.

A.43:  Absolutely.  You know, I think I look at especially some of the
professional athletes, and I was a big Mavericks fan for a long time, and I
watched Roy Tarpley, you know --

B.44:  Oh, #he just,# 

A.45:  -- #he could have# lost his life if it wasn't for someone who cared enough
to say let's give you a drug test and find out where you're at.

B.46:  Uh-huh, and, uh, you know, it's just really a shame that he couldn't get
enough help to keep his career going.

A.47:  Absolutely, I think it's important that we remember that it's not the job
that's important thing, it's, it's the individual.  Kind of like what you were
saying, it's just, I don't know, to me that's, it's putting the focus back
where it should be, you know.  Sure, some people might not appreciate it, but
when it comes right down to it, you're more worried about the individual and
where their status is.

B.48:  Yeah, I think so, and, uh, I think that youngsters who look up to the Roy
Tarpleys and, uh, the other people that have gotten into drugs, I think
they're going to be more conscious of the effect it can have, and they get,
you know, look at what he's thrown away.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  You know, a wonderful career, a tremendous amount of money, uh, because he
couldn't get enough help to overcome it --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- and probably wasn't (( )) early enough either.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  But, I think they can influence the youngsters in a good positive way when
they're good role models.

A.55:  Oh, absolutely, and I think that's the key.

B.56:  Now, I think so too, and I think it's important, you know, I do-, I have
never been against being drug tested myself, and so I feel that the owner of a
company, you know, you set forth policy and you follow through with it too --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- you know, and it doesn't exclude this one or that one.  It's
everybody's.  It's all inclusive.

A.59:  Yep.

B.60:  I know T I does that.  T I -er, you know, they never know who's going to be
called --

A.61:  Well that's goo-, I --

B.62:  -- you know.

A.63:  -- I like that idea very much.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  It's just a random thing that they'll get a call,
