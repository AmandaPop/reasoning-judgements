==========================================================================

A.1:  Set.

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  You, you got the topic, right?  

B.4:  Yeah.  

A.5:  Okay.  Uh, well, where in Dallas are you?  

B.6:  I'm in Richardson.  

A.7:  Oh, okay.  So you do re-, do recycling there?  

@B.8:  Yeah, Richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week
supposedly, if it's not raining.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic
and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to
wait and have a pick up, least of paper, but they don't pick up the other
items.  They don't pick up cans or the --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- plastic.  

A.13:  Are they going to later, do you know?  

B.14:  I'm not sure.  They only started to do the newspaper [breathing], uh, late
last year.  Just kind of like a trial basis.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  And see how it goes, so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other
things.

A.17:  Um.  

B.18:  What about you?  

A.19:  Well, I'm, I'm in Dallas proper -- 

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- in the city of Dallas and I know they do have, you know, a pilot program
going on but it's not here.

B.22:  Um.  

A.23:  So they're not picking up anything [laughter].  

B.24:  Oh. 

A.25:  So, I mean, we, we collect everything [breathing].  We've got all these
boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and
everything.

B.26:  Where do you take them?  

A.27:  Well, there's, there's a couple places.  Unfortunately, we can't find a
place that will take everything.

B.28:  Um.  

A.29:  Uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags --

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- like most of the grocery stores.  

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  And there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything.  I can't
remember what it is they don't take.

B.34:  Um.  

A.35:  And the library will take glass.  So we end up, you know, on the weekend we
pack it all in the car and,

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  and as we go places [laughter] we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off
[laughter], you know.

B.38:  Um.  

A.39:  Drop things off one at a time, but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, I
mean, I would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where
you could do everything.  You know, it would still be more convenient than
what we have now.

B.40:  One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the
stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter.

A.41:  Um.  

B.42:  I think it was -- 

A.43:  Where is that?  

B.44:  -- closer to downtown.  Uh, she's not here anymore -- 

A.45:  Oh. 

B.46:  -- but, uh, yeah,

A.47:  I'm pretty far north.  I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison
actually.

B.48:  Oh. 

A.49:  So I'm, I'm really [laughter] -- 

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  -- I'm, s-, I'm in Dallas, but only technically [laughter].  

B.52:  Well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.

A.57:  Yeah, I've seen those.  

B.58:  You don't get too much money back.  I figure it pays for the gas to take my
cans over there.

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  But normally I collect, oh, like three trash bags full -- 

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  -- and I take them over to that can bank and it's more fun just to kind of
like crunch the cans [laughter],

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  in the can bank.  Don't get too much money for them but,

A.65:  Well, you get something [laughter].  

B.66:  [Laughter].  

A.67:  Uh,

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  We used to do that, but, again, that's another stop -- 

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing, but,
uh, I think that, you know, I heard that it was going well in the pilot area
wherever that is and --

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  -- so hopefully they'll do it soon.  That would be good because we have two
trash pick ups a week --

B.74:  Uh-huh.  

A.75:  -- and, where I grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly
sufficient.  So if they just do, one of them will be trash and the alternate
time would be recyclables, that would be great.

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  So,

B.78:  Yeah.  Uh, I'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in
picking up those papers, you know.  I seem to put them out there --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- on Wednesday and like sometimes they come by, sometimes they don't.

A.81:  Oh. 

B.82:  I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that. 

A.83:  Um.  

B.84:  But I could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic
and --

A.85:  Right.  

B.86:  -- and tin and paper, whatever they were going to, uh, separate into and,
and have them pick it up on, on one of the two days per week.  That would be
easy.

A.87:  Yeah.  Do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and
that, that sort of thing or do they take the whole thing?

B.88:  You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.  

A.89:  Oh, okay.  

B.90:  Uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there -- 

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- and you can't take newspapers.  Now at work, uh, you know, we have
changed our recycling.  At first they were kind of finicky about what kind of
paper you could recycle.  And not too long ago they finally decided if it's
anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first --

A.93:  Let me guess -- 

B.94:  -- they said,

A.95:  -- you work at T I, right?  

B.96:  Yeah, at first they said,   

A.97:  [Laughter] So do I.  

B.98:  They said, no telephone books.  

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  You know, well, that's stupid and then they -- 

A.101:  Um.  

B.102:  -- said no newspapers.  Well, in the, my department everybody gets the WALL
STREET JOURNAL.

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't
recyclable.

A.105:  Yeah.  

B.106:  So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it, say,

A.107:  Well, and they take cans, now, too.  

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  Which is great.

B.110:  I still put my cans in with the cans.  I mean, I don't want it with paper.
Somehow that just seems weird to me [laughter].

A.111:  [Laughter] Well, our department used to collect the cans anyway for the
Christmas tree project.  And, 

B.112:  Oh. 

A.113:  In fact we got, this past year, we got all of our money for the Christmas
tree because we saved cans for the entire year.

B.114:  Ooh.  

A.115:  And it worked out really well.  

B.116:  Well, we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter.

A.117:  Uh-huh.

B.118:  I think that's what that was called.  

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  She collected, she used to collect from the whole department, but she took
them all down to that Dallas Shelter place.

A.121:  Uh-huh.  

B.122:  I wish I could remember the whole name of that place, but it's a charity
for the benefit of this shelter.

A.123:  Uh-huh.  

B.124:  And, yeah, she, u-, she used to collect them from everybody in the
department.

A.125:  Yeah.  

B.126:  She'd go up and down with her little bag [laughter] -- 

A.127:  Yeah.  

B.128:  -- collecting --  

A.129:  Yeah.  

B.130:  -- from everybody.  

A.131:  Because we would get it,
