=========================================================================

A.1:   I am, think that's one of the greatest concerns that, uh, is
in our nation today is the crime problem.  What do you think?  

B.2:   Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  There's a who-, a lot of things that center
around that crime area.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   Uh, you know, from, from just, uh, people trying to make a
living on the wrong side of the law to those who are just trying
to, uh, keep their drug habit up -- 

A.5:   Uh-huh.  

B.6:   -- and, uh, so I think that it encompasses a whole lot of, uh,
concerns.  

A.7:   I know in the large cities, uh, we think that we have more
crime but we have a place out in the country and, uh, we've had
more, more people break into our place in the country than we have
in town.  

B.8:   Oh, really?  

A.9:   And so I don't know that it's confined just to the large
cities.  

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   But, uh, we found that the crime rate in the country increased
when they had let loose some, uh, early parolees.  And the, that
concerned me because I was hoping letting the people out of prison
early on for good behavior would work.  I about decided it didn't. 

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   But, uh, 

B.14:   Yeah, I, I just don't know what kind of criteria they have
used for most of those early parole leases releases so, uh, 

A.15:   I think sometimes it, it depends on what space they need [laughter]. 

B.16:   That's right.  I think you're right.  

A.17:   Yeah.

B.18:   I'm sure it has a lot to do with it.  

A.19:   Do you think that has as much to do with the rising crime rate
as, uh, the, uh, beginning of, uh, of the gangs and things?  

B.20:   Well, I think, uh, certainly that might have something to do
with it.  But I also think that the standards of, uh, what we
consider normal ar-, is drastically changing each generation at
least if not faster by, because of the movies that are out there. 

A.21:   Oh, yes.  

B.22:   And what all the kids are exposed to and also the grown-ups
out there that we're just constantly watching and what we would and
norm-, you know, used to consider awful is almost a normal kind of
thing on T V now and,

A.23:   I see what you mean.  

B.24:   Yeah, and I, so I think that it's, uh, and also I think, uh,
the way our lives, our families are, are, uh, being raised that
with a lot more single families, 

A.25:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.26:   #or a lot# more full-time working families that, uh, there are
a lot more strangers out there taking care of our kids.  And I, I
mean strangers in the sense of not the close family nit type, 

A.27:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.28:   #that they# used to have.  And, uh, I felt, so I think there's
a lot more people growing up confused and feeling not really
considering, uh, you know, necessarily as wanted or loved as they
might have felt, uh, had their family been a little closer nit.   

A.29:   Uh-huh.  Or maybe don't feel as responsible to anyone for
their actions.  

B.30:   That's, that's right.  That's a good, good way to sa-, to say
it.

A.31:   Well, do you think that, uh, with the recession that everyone
says is coming along and more women don't find work and have to
stay home and the economy goes down, do you think that would help,
um, deter the crime raise and, and increase raising a family?  

B.32:   Well, I think it would be a long term,

A.33:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.34:   #change# I don't think that we will, see it too soon.  I think
it will not, I don't think it will slow down for quite some time
just because there, you know, it's going to take that pendulum a
long time to swing, 

A.35:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.36:   #back# the other way.  

A.37:   Well, I see an awful lot of working parents who are very, very
involved in their children.  

B.38:   That's true.  

A.39:   And, uh, I don't know.  I know it's hard especially to monitor
television if you're not around.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   But, uh, 

B.42:   Oh, yeah, I think there are definitely a ways that both
parents can work and have recen-, you know, responsible and, and,
you know, very loving children growing up and staying that way. 
But I think it takes the effort and extra time and effort out of
those parents and not too many, not as many people are doing that
as they should because we're used to having an easy, 

A.43:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.44:   #get it when you want it# society.  And, uh, you know, the
easy way out is considered more appropriate sometimes than, than
the working hard message,  

A.45:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.46:   #that used# to be.  #So,# 

A.47:   #I have# a friend who's a principal in school and she said
that a lot of the parents that she calls they just flat don't want
to be bothered.  

B.48:   Right.  I think we're all tired and having too many pressures
and I, just occurred, when you mentioned principal, it occurred to
me when I was teaching how, uh, it was becoming quite disturbing
realizing how many crack babies there were becoming, 

A.49:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.50:   #you know,# out there in the educational area and -- 

A.51:   Uh-huh.  

B.52:   -- and the things that we'll be dealing with just on the
educational front that, uh, are people tha-, children that will
eventually grow to be older, 

A.53:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.54:   #possible# crime makers themselves because they started out in
life without any (( )) you know, uh,
