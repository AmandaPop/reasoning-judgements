============================================================================

B.1:  Well, you go first.  You called [laughter]. 

@A.2:  [Laughter] Okay.  Uh, let's see.  Um, well, I'm about forty years old so I
was, um, right at draft age,

B.3:  Right.  

A.4:  back, back when, uh, when that was all going on.  

B.5:  Right.  

A.6:  And, uh, so that pret-, it very much affected me as, you know, as far as
being very impressionable right at that time.  Um, I, I didn't think, I was
kind of, kind of a, caught up in the, in the hippie movement back then --

B.7:  Yes.  

A.8:  -- and I didn't think it was, uh, worthwhile or, or right then, and I'm not
any, I'm not like, you know, I'm not a, not that way anymore, but I still
don't think it was, uh, uh, [breathing] I still have a lot of questions about
why,

B.9:  [Noise]. 

A.10:  we were there and, and, uh, the way it was conducted and all kinds of
things.

B.11:  Right.  

A.12:  Yeah.  How about yourself?  

B.13:  Well, I'm, I'm, I'll be forty-two in February. 

A.14:  So y-, 

B.15:  In fact, my husband was in the first lottery.  You know, he, he was in the
first, first lottery and, uh, he got a high draft number,

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  thank goodness, so he didn't have to go, but I never was for it either.

A.18:  Uh-huh.  

B.19:  I, um, I don't know.  I just felt it was a real political thing that I
don't really think ever got us anywhere.

A.20:  Yeah.  

B.21:  You know, I don't, I don't feel that we, that we accomplished much.  I
think ma-, I, I don't know.  I, I want to say well, maybe if we had gone into
really win it, but then I, I'm much more of dove than that so I don't know
that I would have even liked that.

A.22:  Yeah.  

B.23:  I just felt that it, 

A.24:  [Sniffing].

B.25:  it drug on so long and at such a tremendous cost, um, and I think it was
hard for people to keep up good morale in a situation like that.  I mean I, I
can't imagine what it was like for the men fighting over there.

A.26:  Yeah.  

B.27:  I think that must have been a really hard thing to, um, you know, to, to
keep their morale up.

A.28:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.29:  Uh, when they knew that we weren't really trying to win and [lipsmack] and
all of that so I never was really for it.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  I mean, uh, 

A.32:  Well, I was in the, uh, last lottery.  

B.33:  Oh, you were?  

A.34:  Yep.  And I was, I came out number two hundred and fifty-one. 

B.35:  Huh.  

A.36:  And I had been and they, and, uh, they only took up two hundred that year.

B.37:  Uh-huh.  

A.38:  And I had been, uh, in, in R O T C too, uh, so I would at least have a
choice about what I was going to do.

B.39:  Uh-huh.  

A.40:  And when I came up two hundred fifty-one I went, that's it [laughter].

B.41:  Yeah.  

A.42:  I dropped out of R O T C and,

B.43:  Yeah.  

A.44:  and, uh, uh, yeah, I, I don't, uh, I guess, uh, I, I kind of do the same
thing.  I kind of think well, you know, I me-, if, if, at least if we had w-,
going all out to win it, maybe it would have been worth something but then
again I, I, uh, probably too much of a dove myself to really,

B.45:  Well, right.  I, I don't necessarily like that philosophy, but I think I
would have liked that better than --

A.46:  What we did.  

B.47:  -- what we did.  

A.48:  Yeah, because all we had is, uh, like ten, thirteen years and fifty-six
thousand people and,

B.49:  Exactly.  

A.50:  and, and we, uh, I don't know that we, did we accomplish anything at all?

B.51:  I, I, I don't think so.  

A.52:  [Laughter]. 

B.53:  I mean, uh [laughter],

A.54:  I mean the communists got it anyway.  

B.55:  And, 

A.56:  And, uh,

B.57:  and it's still such a mess in that part of the country today. 

A.58:  Yeah.  

B.59:  You know it's not like, you know I think if things had been resolved and
that was in a better situation but I don't think that's true.

A.60:  Yeah.

B.61:  So, uh, you know, I'm not sure that we really accomplished much of
anything.

A.62:  Yeah.  

B.63:  So, I don't know and, and I still think we're paying for that.  I think
that there are, you know, a lot of the men just suffered so terribly in that
situation.

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  Uh, [lipsmack] so, I, I don't know.  I, I'm glad, I nev-, I didn't have
anybod-, well, I had one person close to me that went.  But that's all.  I
didn't know a lot of people that went.

A.66:  Yeah, 

B.67:  Did yo-, did you?

A.68:  I didn't know anyone that, that I can recall that went that which is, uh,
now I've met some, I've met some after the fact, you know, people that I
worked with and stuff that had been, several actually that I worked with (( ))
but I didn't know ((I didn't)), no one that I grew up with.

B.69:  Well, 

A.70:  Uh, 

B.71:  I had one person and he was in the infantry, and he was little and what he
did was he went into the tunnels.

A.72:  No, you're kidding?  

B.73:  No.  And he came back.  He, he lived through it,

A.74:  Huh.

B.75:  which is just amazing, and he would not ta-, um, [lipsmack] talk about it
much at all.

A.76:  Yeah.  

B.77:  He, he just would not discuss it.  Um, he did tell us one time about seeing
someone a, a, a kid about his age, you know, he was probably twenty I think,
and he came up-, upon a, a Vietnamese and they both had their guns on each
other and they just looked at each other and put their guns down and walked
away.

A.78:  Huh.  Very sensible [laughter].  

B.79:  [Laughter] I thought so too.  

A.80:  Yeah.  What, 

B.81:  And, uh,

A.82:  what part of the country were you in when all that was going on?

B.83:  I'm from Phoenix, Arizona.  

A.84:  Okay.  

B.85:  So I was in Phoenix.  Where were you?  

A.86:  I was in, uh, I'm from New York but I was in, uh, uh, Fort Worth.

B.87:  Oh, you came out here to go to school?  

A.88:  Yeah, so I was kind of in and I was, you know, there were, there were about
twenty hippies on the whole campus.  I went to T C U and,

B.89:  Yeah.  

A.90:  there were, there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus,

B.91:  Yeah.  

A.92:  and we were, we were very much minority [laughter].  

B.93:  [Laughter]  Oh.

A.94:  So it was kind of, it wasn't like being up in, uh, Kent State with, uh,
with, uh, ten thousand protesters that were, that were,

B.95:  Well, I was in Arizona State and I can remember, 

A.96:  [Sniffing].

B.97:  um, coming out.  I had gone into a restaurant to eat and coming out and
there were about, oh, I don't know how many thousands of students coming down
the, the street.  They had completely cordoned off the street and, you know,
there was lots of protesting going on there at the time.

A.98:  Uh-huh.  

B.99:  So I wh-,
