========================================================================

A.1:  I was going to say, my, uh, college is Northern State University in
Aberdeen, South Dakota, and our head football coach, Dennis Muir {phonetically
spelled}, used to be an assistant coach at B Y U.

B.2:  Oh, really.

A.3:  So I thought that was kind of an in-, interesting coincidence.

B.4:  Huh [laughter].  So you went to what college?

A.5:  Uh, Northern State University in Aberdeen, South Dakota.

B.6:  And what did you graduate in?

A.7:  I ju-, in what major or what year?

B.8:  Yeah, major [laughter].

A.9:  International business.

B.10:  Oh, really.

A.11:  Yeah.  And you?

B.12:  I'm going to B Y U, and I'm going into nursing --

A.13:  Okay.

B.14:  -- so.

A.15:  Well, that sounds interesting.  How long of a program is that?

B.16:  Forever [laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  Seems like, anyways.  It's about five years, but it's probably going to
take me longer, because I didn't decide to major in that until, [sniffing] uh,
about a year and a half after I was already in school, so.

A.19:  You know, I read a study once, and it said that, uh, like thirty-four
percent of, uh, college students actually graduate in four years from a four
year program.

B.20:  Oh, really.  #That sounds.#

A.21:  #It took me,# it took me five years.

B.22:  Yeah [laughter].

A.23:  So, you just, you get started and you change your mind, or you want to pick
up a second major, if you're management, you, you, thought, I, I'll take that
marketing, it's just only was three more classes --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- you know, and you, just doesn't happen that you get out in four years.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  But.

B.28:  So what is your advice to --

A.29:  My advice is --

B.30:  -- picking a college.

A.31:  -- is, uh, look for, at the student to faculty ratio, you know, if you're
going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred
to one, I don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college
experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  Is that, what was yours more like?

A.33:  Yeah --

B.34:  Was there a,

A.35:  -- it was about twenty-six to one.

B.36:  Really.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Oh, that's great.

A.39:  Which is, you know, it, it's interesting, but it, it's what I thought was
nice is you could al-, there was always time to talk to professor, you know,
and, and they knew you.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  You weren't just in their class, you know, and so you could, you could go
talk to them in their office almost at any time, and, or if you ran into them
in the student union or whatever, you know, you could sit down, talk to them
about a problem.  They're always willing to help you out.  So, but I, I's, I,
I put that against, uh, my high school where we had, uh, a biology class of
three hundred and fifty students and.

B.42:  Wow, in high school?

A.43:  Yeah --

B.44:  Oh.

A.45:  -- it was a biology lecture class --

B.46:  Wow.

A.47:  -- and, you know, it, it just wasn't the same.  You're sitting there, and
you're taking notes and, you know, you got a computerized test scores,
multiple choice, because there's no way they could correct a three hundred
fifty point short answer test --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- uh, you know, a three hundred fifty person short answer test.  And, it
just wasn't the same.  You, you'd run, you'd pass the teacher in high school
and, even in high school you could say high to your teachers, unless you're in
that biology class, and they just, they'd look at you like, do I know you? or
should I know you?

B.50:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, there's, it's, the classes here are pretty big, so, it's
hard to get individual help [throat_clearing].  It's kind of, you're on your
own [laughter].

A.51:  Do you get, uh, a lot of tutoring, or.

B.52:  No [laughter].  Very little, I mean, well, like my, for example, I have,
I'm in a chemistry class right now --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and there's tons of students in it, and there's one T A for the whole
class.

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  And he only has certain office hours, and so there's only certain times you
can talk to him, and.

A.57:  And you could get there and his office hours could, I mean he could have
like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty-two people
waiting to talk to him, and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway.

B.58:  Right, yeah.

A.59:  Well, what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of
attending college?

B.60:  Oh, man.  I think your advice is good.  Um let's see.  My advice would be
to pick a major before you get into college [laughter] --

A.61:  That's excellent advice.

B.62:  -- because I, I didn't, and I took tons of classes that I didn't need to,
and, um, I don't know, I just feel like I'm, it's, it's going to take me a lot
longer than, and not that's always bad, but it's, I don't know, it's
frustrating, I guess.

A.63:  Well, it, it, it does get it.  You know, you get to the point where it's,
I'm never going to get done.

B.64:  Right.

A.65:  You know, I, I mean, I was taking summer classes and (( )) let me get out
of here.

B.66:  Yep.

A.67:  But, uh, no, that's good advice.  Even if you don't have your major decided
on, have an idea what you think you might want, you know, so you don't want
management, but you think you want business,
