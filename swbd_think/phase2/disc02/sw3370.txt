REMARKS:        Speaker B was constantly rustling papers in the
background.  Both strayed from the subject towards the end.

=============================================================================

A.1:   The topic today is credit cards. 

B.2:   Yeah, bummer. 

A.3:   Uh, why don't you go ahead and tell me some, uh, some of your favorite uses for a credit card if, if it all, that supplies. 

B.4:   No, because I don't have any. 

A.5:   Okay. 

B.6:   I gave up all my credit cards when I got my first divorce. [laughter] It's, uh, 

A.7:   Well, I wish I was in your shoes Pat. I, uh, I was, I was in pretty much control of my credit cards up until the point where we moved down here from South Dakota, and then, uh, it took my wife and I about two months to find a job so in that interim everything, 

B.8:   Oh, yeah. 

A.9:   went on the credit card. And, uh, so now we're slowly trying to pay it off, and if I would, I just keep thinking if I would have just been able to take that money and put it in a savings account instead of, 

B.10:   Paying bills. 

A.11:   Right. I'd be, I, you know, I'd, I'd be doing all right today, but no, I've got those darn credit card bills hanging over my head. 

B.12:   Yeah, but that's still, it still helps some. Sometimes they help and sometimes they don't. 

A.13:   Right. 

B.14:   You know I think if I had one I'd probably be maxed out [laughter]. 

A.15:   Well, that's, uh, [laughter] that's always a possibility. 

B.16:   You know. 

A.17:   Um, 

B.18:   Because I'm not very what you call, uh, [lipsmack] what's the word? Uh, controllable. 

A.19:   Okay. 

B.20:   My husband is, but I'm definitely not one of them people. 

A.21:   Okay. 

B.22:   [Laughter]. 

A.23:   Well, I, uh, while we were doing, like I said, we were doing all right, you know, we'd put gas, occasionally go out to eat or pick up a small gift or something, you know, some clothes or something but and we could always pay it off when, 

B.24:   Uh-huh. 

A.25:   when the bill came. And when we moved down here and everything was going on the credit card, I think we, we got a little rampant. We, you know, went out to eat out everything and, you know, we, we ((would have)) to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists, 

B.26:   Yep. 

A.27:   the first, the first month that we were here, 

B.28:   Uh-huh. 

A.29:   and, of course, everybody takes credit cards so -- 

B.30:   Why not. 

A.31:   -- it got, uh, it got way out of hand but thankfully we're, we're now -- 

B.32:   Uh-huh. 

A.33:   -- working to pay them off and, and we haven't put anything on them in a couple months. 

B.34:   Oh, yeah. It gets bad [laughter]. 

A.35:   It can. 

B.36:   Huh. 

A.37:   It sure can. Well, what, uh, what do you find are some of the best advantages of credit cards? 

B.38:   Emergencies. 

A.39:   Uh-huh. 

B.40:   If you have one major credit card, you can do anything during an emergency. 

A.41:   That's true. 

B.42:   Other than that then you are more or less have to have money or, uh, some kind of way of getting some. 

A.43:   Right. Right. 

B.44:   So, that's probably, you know, the best thing I can think of. The, the bad thing is you get accustom to them [laughter]. 

A.45:   That's right you can. You certainly can. 

B.46:   You know, so. I don't know I, I was used to them and then when my, me and my husband broke up and I had to pay all the bills that did it. I, huh-uh, none. [laughter] I don't want any, so. 

A.47:   Well, I understand that. 

B.48:   With -- 

A.49:   You know you can't even rent a car hardly or, uh, get an airplane ticket, 

B.50:   -- without one. 

A.51:   without a credit card. 

B.52:   That's right. 

A.53:   It's, 

B.54:   Unless you got cash money. 

A.55:   Right. 

B.56:   Uh-huh. 

A.57:   Well, even if you have cash, it's hard to, if you're under twenty-five and you, you have cash, you still can't get, 

B.58:   You can't rent a car. 

A.59:   still can't rent a car. 

B.60:   No. You can't rent a car. 

A.61:   You 	have to have a credit card. 

B.62:   Yeah, uh-huh. 

A.63:   And that, uh, I don't know. 

B.64:   [Laughter] I think the only thing that saves me there is you can rent a car through T I if I really had to rent a car. 

A.65:   Okay. 

B.66:   But other th-, 

A.67:   You work with T I then? 

B.68:   Yeah. 

A.69:   Okay. Well, you don't y-, speaking of cash, you don't get the five dollars for the phone call you j-, you get the gift ((part)). Isn't that how that worked if you're a T I employee? 

B.70:   Yeah. I get a little point. You get so many points and you get ((a lit-)) pick a little gift and that's about it [rustling]. 

A.71:   Well, that's all right. That's, that's an interesting incentive. We, uh, we wanted to do it because we weren't from the south and I think we would a-, we'd be able to, 

B.72:   [Rustling] Meet more people. 

A.73:   Well not, 

B.74:   Or get to know, get to know about Texas more, uh, 

A.75:   Yeah, exactly. 

B.76:   Yeah, uh-huh [rustling]. 

A.77:   You know, get, get to, I still have a hard time, uh, understanding [laughter] some people's accent. 

B.78:   Oh, yeah. 

A.79:   You know I, I can't, I just can't understand what they're saying. 

B.80:   [Rustling] Wh-, [laughter], 

A.81:   But, 

B.82:   Yeah, some of them have some strong ones. 

A.83:   Yeah, there are. 

B.84:   Yeah [rustling]. I've only been here thirteen years so [lipsmack]. 

A.85:   Okay. Where are you originally from? 

B.86:   Los Angeles. 

A.87:   Los Angeles. Boy, there's a change. 

B.88:   Definitely [laughter]. 

A.89:   I suppose it's about as cold there as it is here now? 

B.90:   No. Now I wish I was back, so. 

A.91:   Well, 

B.92:   It's hot. 

A.93:   what's life in L A like? 

B.94:   Not good, that's why I'm here [laughter]. 

A.95:   Okay. 

B.96:   Uh-huh. 

A.97:   A lot of crime and, 

B.98:   Oh, very high [rustling]. 

A.99:   Seems to me, you know, I couldn't understand why it would be such a heavily populated area if there's so much crime, so much smog, so much traffic. 

B.100:   ((You just can't)) people can't leave. You can't just up and leave and not know where you're going. I left because I was in the service so I didn-, ha-, you know I had a lot to, I could leave [laughter]. 

A.101:   Okay.
