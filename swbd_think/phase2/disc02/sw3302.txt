A.1:   Well, Charlie, what do you think?  Should we spend more on
AIDS research, or stay the same?  

@B.2:   Well, I don't, I don't think we're, uh, spending enough.  So
I, I think we sh-, I th-, I sh-, I think we should spend more.  

A.3:   Why do you think we don't spend enough?  

B.4:   Uh, let's see.  Uh, you know, to tell you the truth, I, I
couldn't tell you exact-, I couldn't tell you what we're spending,
but, from what I, from what I hear, uh, from most of the, you know,
just reading about AIDS advocacy groups and, oh, people like that,
uh, there have been a couple of deaths, uh, lately, uh, like one
lady that was on the President's AIDS committee, uh, that we're
not, I, it just doesn't seem like we're taking the disease as, as
seriously as we need to.  Uh, lot of, lot of talk about it but
we're, d-, I don't know.  What do you think?  

A.5:   Well, I agree with you.  I think we have a lot of talk, but
not dollars.  

B.6:   Yeah.  

A.7:   And, you know, we, we s-, [clicking] our situation where,
we're faced with people that, you know, choose a lifestyle that may
cause AIDS [clicking], but then at the same token, there are a lot
of people like the children in Florida who didn't choose a
lifestyle, but there was no help for them.  

B.8:   Right.  

A.9:   And, I think one of the things we can do, as far as the
government goes, is just to dispel some of the myths {pause}.  You
know, drinking from a water fountain will give you AIDS.  

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   Using a restroom will give you AIDS. 

B.12:   Yeah [throat_clearing]. 

A.13:   But, at the same token, I feel like heart disease, cancer,
multiple sclerosis, where do we put those in perspective to AIDS? 

B.14:   Uh-huh.  Well, I wonder w-, I don't know what the statistics
are, but I think, uh, it's, uh, the numbers of, of people infected.
Do you know an-, have any idea what they are, what they're
estimating now?  

A.15:   No, I don't, and, you know, I'm like you, I do not know -- 

B.16:   Well, I, you know what it,  

A.17:   -- what the government is spending on AIDS.  

B.18:   Yeah.  What, what I think is that, is that somehow in, in our
m-, a lot of our minds it's still a disease that affects primarily
homosexuals and intravenous drug users, but what we're finding is
that, that, that it's, it's, uh, also, it's affecting a lot more
people than that.  

A.19:   Yes.  

B.20:   That, that there's a lot more, 

A.21:   [Throat_clearing].

B.22:   uh, uh, heterosexual transmission of the disease than, than
we probably thought.  

A.23:   Right.  

B.24:   So, a-, you know, I mean, as long as it's, as long as it's,
uh, limited to those two selec-, you know, two kind of narrow
areas, homosexuals and intravenous drug users, it, it, it's
probably going to get, unfortunately, sad to say, a lot more lip
service than it will actually, actually dollars.  And, uh, it might
be that [clicking] as it spreads among the general population more,
that, that, uh, you know, and, and in all these stories about these
kids who had transfusions and these, oh, there's been a couple
housewives lately that were, you know, r-, national news, that they
had had trans-, trans-, uh, -fusions, and they, you know, and
they're, they're, they died, you know, [laughter] left behind
families and, oh,   

A.25:   Yeah.  

B.26:   Yep.  

A.27:   Well, I'm in Texas and we have a teacher that died from AIDS. 

B.28:   Oh, you, you all did?  

A.29:   Yeah.  

B.30:   In your, uh, in your s-, school district or something?  

A.31:   Well, not my school district, but it was in the state of Texas
and it was because of a transfusion.  

B.32:   Yeah.  

A.33:   And I think that got a lot more publicity because, again, it
wasn't a minority group.  

B.34:   Yeah.  

A.35:   And, you know, we're looking at a situation that, hopefully,
can be controlled.  

B.36:   Yeah, yeah, I don't know, kind of, kind of scary, actually. 

A.37:   It is frightening.  

B.38:   Yeah.  

A.39:   You know, because it could be you or I and then what would we
do?  We'd want help.  

B.40:   What are you, what are you going to do if you're in an auto
accident and, uh, you had, need a blood transfusion?  Are you going
to have confidence in the blood supply?  [Laughter]. 

A.41:   [Laughter] That's true.  

B.42:   I don't, I don't know that I would.  Or will [laughter].  

A.43:   Yeah, well, my mother had a blood transfusion about four years
ago. 

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   And I, I was scared to even mention to her -- 

B.46:   Yeah.  

A.47:   -- that there was an emergency situation, we couldn't give,
she couldn't give her blood and -- 

B.48:   Yeah.  

A.49:   -- we couldn't go down to give h-, our blood for her.  And,
you know, there's always the possibility.  

B.50:   Yeah, and, and, I think as long as it's, uh, as long as it's
still people that are thinking that it's mostly even people that,
that, it's almost like they're choosing to practice those
lifestyles, that they're choo-, you know, that's their choice, that
they ran that risk.  I mean, I, you know, that, that's prob-, I
hate to say that.  That sounds,  

A.51:   No, but, the, I agree with you.  

B.52:   Uh, that sounds cr-, cold and cruel, but that's probably, as
long as people perceive of it being that way, I, I mean, that
probably explains the lack of, uh, lack of concrete money and ((big
expense)). 

A.53:   Yeah, and I think it's, you know,
