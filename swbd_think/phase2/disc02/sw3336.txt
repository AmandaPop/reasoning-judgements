A.1:  Okay, Vic, our topic is budgets.

B.2:  Yes.

A.3:  Do you keep a monthly budget?

@B.4:  Uh, I talk about doing that a lot.

A.5:  [Laughter] Welcome to the club [laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter]  Uh, I, I use a, uh, computer software program --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- to keep track of all expenses.  Primarily it's a checking,
you know, a check balancing program, but it does catego-,
categorize everything --

A.9:  Oh, how interesting.

B.10:  -- and it allows you to either to go in and create a budget
and then compare against it, or actually you will sort of
generate one based on how you categorize things over the months.

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  So I have all the information there.  Uh, it's just that I
haven't been very diligent at, at really tracking it --

A.13:  Well, uh, it --

B.14:  -- and following it.

A.15:  -- it's like the money, it's hard to keep track of it [laughter] --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- as it goes out.

B.18:  Right.  What do you do?

A.19:  Uh, I'm a teacher --

B.20:  Okay.

A.21:  -- and we're at, my husband and I are at a stage in life
where we've got one left in college --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in
college [laughter].

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  Their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  We've quit.

B.28:  Okay.  Um, well the biggest problem that I've had, or one of
the, one of the problems is, um, keeping track of cash, you know,
expenditures --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- uh, I think that one of the things that, uh, makes
budgeting very hard is the convenience of automatic teller
machines, uh, the ability to go up and get cash so easily.

A.31:  Okay, I, see, I stopped those four years ago.

B.32:  Really.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Okay, well, see, you have control.

A.35:  Yeah, oh, yeah, now we are, you know, um, well, we're at a
point in life that we're looking to retirement rather than, you
know, earnings --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- so it's gotten to the point where, um, yeah, aut-,
automatic teller, I only had the card --

B.38:  Okay.

A.39:  -- and it was on my own personal account, and it got way out
of control, very fast [noise] --

B.40:  Huh.

A.41:  -- so I have a tendency now, I take an allowance,

B.42:  #Well that's pretty good.#

A.43:  #when it's gone, it's gone.#

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  Now, I'm finished, if it's gone the fifteenth of the month,
then --

B.46:  It's gone, huh,

A.47:  -- it's gone --

B.48:  Well that's great.

A.49:  -- and, uh, we have a tendency not to use cash, we pay
everything by check --

B.50:  Right, well, that's a good way to do it.

A.51:  -- and so that way, we keep control of what we're spending,
where it's going, what it's going for.

B.52:  Well, that's great.

A.53:  So, um, you know, it's, I take a hundred dollars a month,
that's all I take --

B.54:  Oh, wow.

A.55:  -- and, you know, I mean, I don't buy groceries out of th-,
that's my own little slush fund if want to call it that --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and that's for my little incidentals, or running to the
grocery store to get a, you know, gallon of milk or whatever --

B.58:  [/Noise] Right.

A.59:  -- but, um, after that it's check only --

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  -- so we can, you know, really know where our money's going
and, you know, what's happening.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  [Noise]  What about, how are you on charge cards?

B.64:  Uh, pretty good about that --

A.65:  Good.

B.66:  -- the last few years anyway.  We did have a MasterCard that
got out of hand for a while, but we just, just stopped using it,
didn't get rid of it.  There are times such as, oh, some mail
order type things, uh, where it's very convenient to have --

A.67:  Yes.

B.68:  -- uh, but that's really the only thing it's used for, and
one, one thought I do have is with, uh, is that I, in my job, I
travel a good bit, and have to use my own, uh, credit card, I
don't have a business credit card --

A.69:  Okay.

B.70:  -- so I use that and then have to file expense reports and, uh,
it just adds another complication to properly tracking expenses,
knowing how much of it is reimbursed business expense --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- uh, or how much is my own expense for --

A.73:  (( )).

B.74:  -- now, I use credit cards, not for credit but for
convenience, in other words, I pay, we pay monthly --

A.75:  Okay.

B.76:  -- the balance due.

A.77:  Yeah, well, this might help you because, see, my husband
travels as well --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- and we have separate charge accounts. 

B.80:  Okay.

A.81:  He's got an American Express and that's only traveling.  

B.82:  Okay.

A.83:  Then we both have a Visa or MasterCard.

B.84:  Okay.

A.85:  So --

B.86:  That's a pretty good way to do it,

A.87:  -- anything on his American Express is his and it's his
expense.  Now, he gave me one --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- and if I go with him on work --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- I only charge on that card --

B.92:  Okay.

A.93:  -- I don't put it on my MasterCard.

B.94:  Right.

A.95:  So we've separated those two completely.  And I know what you
mean, because at first we used to intermingle our funds --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and we weren't sure --

B.98:  Oh, yeah, it's hard to be, to be sure,

A.99:  -- or our bills were outrageous --

B.100:  Right.

A.101:  -- you know, because his traveling expenses were, you know, I
mean, he's a traveling salesman, so --

B.102:  Oh, boy.

A.103:  -- we're looking at,
