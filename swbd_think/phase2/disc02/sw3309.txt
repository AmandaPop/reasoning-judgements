B.1:   [Breathing]. 

A.2:   Are, are we paying too much in taxes, and are we getting what
we pay for?  What's your opinion?  

@B.3:   Well, it's kind of a broad subject, uh, I,  

A.4:   [Laughter]. 

B.5:   I think there are some areas where we, where we, uh, pretty
well, you know, get our money's worth, but I, I also think there
are a lot of areas [breathing] especially in, uh, big
government, federal government, uh, where we're short changed.  Uh,
lot of money spent for, uh, things that are not used and, uh, I
was, I was in the Air Force and I was at, there were, there was
equipment at every base I was ever on that was just going to waste.
It was just sitting and rusting and, you know, and [breathing],

A.6:   Okay.  I, I tend to agree with you.  When it comes to
government spending, there are so many studies done that don't mean
anything -- 

B.7:   Yeah.  

A.8:   -- but we'll spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
dollars on.  

B.9:   Yeah.  

A.10:   And it's nice to know something doesn't work or something
doesn't exist, but, it could be put to more practical use.  

B.11:   Yeah, and I, I think that, uh, [breathing] it's a, a tone
of our times that politicians, uh, are into themselves more than
they are into, you know, doing something worthwhile for the people
they represent, which is really unfortunate.  

A.12:   That is true.  I agree with you in that area.  Uh, I have a
tendency to, I'm in, from Texas and I read, you know, how our
politicians voted each week in the paper.  

B.13:   Yeah.  

A.14:   And it's, you know, it's interesting how the votes vary and
what they ran on in platform -- 

B.15:   Uh-huh.  

A.16:   -- don't necessarily come true in their voting in the senate
or Congress, whatever.  

B.17:   And don't really respond to, uh, people who write them and
call them and, uh, you know, unless they're in the limelight and
under pressure [laughter] [breathing].  So, yeah, I think we get
short changed on that.  

A.18:   Right, that's very true.  What, what state do you live in?  

B.19:   Texas.  

A.20:   Okay.  

B.21:   That's,  

A.22:   What do you think about Robin Hood?  

B.23:   Well [breathing], I work for school district and, uh, it's,
it has hurt us a lot.  Uh, there has to be some way, I think, to
equalize education opportunities.  But, uh, you know, our, we, we
tend to think, I think, e-, especially big government, tends to
think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it.  And
I don't, you know, that's just not true.  I don't think the, you
know, I don't think money is going to take the place of
intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills.  Uh, I think there
are, there are too many things that money can't [breathing], uh,
that, that money can't buy that, that are important as far as
education is concerned.  

A.24:   That's true.  What school district do you work for?  

B.25:   Richardson.  

A.26:   Okay.  I work for Plano.  

B.27:   Oh. 

A.28:   [Laughter]. 

B.29:   Great, okay.  

A.30:   So, we're comparable.   

B.31:   Yeah.  

A.32:   As a matter of fact, I just paid my Richardson taxes because
I live in Richardson and supplemented the Robin Hoods very
thoroughly, I think.  

B.33:   Yeah, I think we've, uh,  

A.34:   Our taxes went up tremendously.  

B.35:   Yeah, we have got it on the line [laughter], don't we.  

A.36:   Yes.  

B.37:   And it's not going to get any better.  D-, you know, I mean,
it's going up and up and up.  Uh, I used to live in the Plano
school district, and, uh, there was a, an organization, a taxpayers
organization that, uh, finally communicated the message to the, I
think to the people in Plano that, you know, we didn't want our
taxes raised.  

A.38:   Yes, I remember there was about four, five years ago.  

B.39:   Yeah.  

A.40:   Yes.  

B.41:   But, this, you know, this, uh, I think living in Richardson,
we're kind of spoiled because I think we get, [throat_clearing] we
come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is
concerned, I think [laughter] than probably any, any city in the
country.  

A.42:   Yes, well, did you read in the Dallas paper where they
increased the teach-, the administrators' pay by thirty three
percent --  

B.43:   Is that incredible?  

A.44:   -- after they laid off all those teachers.  

B.45:   That's, that's the biggest mess I've ever heard of.  You know,
how can you, how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you,
you know, if you have to lay people off?  

A.46:   Right.  But, you know, I'm not going to complain because Plano
got, we all got a pay raise this year.  

B.47:   Yeah.  

A.48:   You all got a pay raise this year.  

B.49:   Yeah. 

A.50:   Is that correct?  

B.51:   Well, yeah, I think the teachers d-, uh, did, and I don't know
about administrators.  I, I'm semiretired and I was, I was an
administrator, so I, you know, I don't get a [laughter] raise
anymore.  I just,  

A.52:   Okay [laughter].  

B.53:   I, I work part-time and just get, uh, [lipsmack] [breathing],
you know, my pay doesn't change.  

A.54:   Are you on the early retirement?  

B.55:   Yes.  

A.56:   Oh, are you enjoying it?  

B.57:   Yes, very much.  Uh, course, I, I still work two part-time
jobs [laughter].  

A.58:   [Laughter]. 

B.59:   So, it's not really total retirement.  

A.60:   Well, it's interesting, you know, because when you look at
what Richardson has done with the early retirement you,
