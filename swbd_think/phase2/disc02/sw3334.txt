A.1:  Well, what do you know about Latin American policies?

@B.2:  [Breathing]  Well, I think they're kind of ambivalent,
really.  Uh, I just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out
of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other
situations --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- you know.  

A.5:  Huh.

B.6:  We, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to
support.

A.7:  Are you, uh, relating this, uh, to the, uh, affair we've got
going on in Haiti right now?

B.8:  That, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big
powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that
depend on us so much --

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  -- without, you know, just telling them, running their
country for them but,

A.11:  That, that's just it.

B.12:  It's got to be tough, but, I mean, uh, uh, you sure, you
still have to, you know, let them know how you feel.

A.13:  Right, I guess my concern, [child_talking] you know, no
matter which, no matter which side we take [child_talking], we're
going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, 
antisupporters, I guess, for lack of better term, and, uh, like 
you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset
somebody, but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance.

B.14:  Yeah, it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many
countries in, in South America and Central America depend on
something that damages people, like the, you know, like
cocaine --

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- from Columbia, and --

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  -- uh, [breathing], you know, of course I, I'm sure we have
some enemies down there who wouldn't care what happened to us,
but --

A.19:  That's true.

B.20:  -- but that is, that's a tough deal, and it, I don't think
that, maybe I, maybe it's, you know, I'm reflecting how I feel
about it, but I have a feeling that we, that we really don't
understand basically the, the, the competing factions [laughter]
in lot of those countries and --

A.21:  Sure.

B.22:  -- I mean, they've been hammering (( )), for the last, you
know, ten centuries, and it's still going on, and, uh, we, we
dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some
how, 

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  some times,

A.25:  Yep, that's about the lump sum of it.  Well, um, I was
speaking with a, a woman from, I believe she was from the
Honduras or Guatemala, or somewhere in there, no, she was from El
Salvador --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- and, uh, she was from a relatively wealthy family, and
when, uh, the Contras came into power, of course with, uh, oh,
gosh darn, what's his face, he's in, in Florida jail now, Marcos --

B.28:  Yeah, yeah.

A.29:  -- uh, no, he's, Marcos is Philippines,

B.30:  Yeah, um, well, I'm blank [laughter] on it.

A.31:  Well, you know who I'm talking about.

B.32:  I can see his face (( )) forget his name [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah, I, I know it, uh, anyway, when he came into power, he
basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned
it to himself.

B.34:  Yeah, kind of nationalized it --

A.35:  Right --

B.36:  -- for himself,

A.37:  -- right, and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of
the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the U S government in 
that respect, and in that respect I have to agree that I think 
we're taking the right stance --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- uh, because they were a democracy turned, uh --

B.40:  Dictator,

A.41:  -- yeah, right --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- basically a dictator fascist.

B.44:  And it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible
to that kind of thing, it just --

A.45:  Sure.

B.46:  -- you know, unstable.

A.47:  Well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, U S free trade
agreement we're working on with Mexico?

B.48:  Well, I think it's long overdue --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- uh, I just, you know, there's so much difference in, in
the economies of the two countries, I'm not, you know, I have a
problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,
there's, uh, it seems like there's, and I, this may be unfair to
Mexico, but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in, in
foreign policy a lot of the times.

A.51:  Uh-huh, Mexico, they're, I know they're trying, they're
really trying, the Mexican government is trying, and a lot of the
larger Mexican businesses are trying to, [breathing] oh, make
themselves Americanized, I guess --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- and, uh, which is great because that's what they basically
need to do.  The big problem with the United States is we have
our basic nine to five schedule --

B.54:  Yeah -- 

A.55:  -- you know, and -- 

B.56:  -- yeah.

A.57:  -- we don't have the Siesta, and there's, the cultural
differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really
hurting, uh, the Mexican people, because they've had their way of
life, and we've had our way of life, and, uh,

B.58:  I think their, their version of the good old boy network
going that, uh, you know, has a lot,
