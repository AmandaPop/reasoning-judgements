=========================================================================

A.1:  Go [laughter].  What have you seen?

B.2:  [Laughter]  Do you want to talk first about the one that you've seen or do
you want me to go?

A.3:  Oh, mine was too scary.  Go ahead.  

@B.4:  The last movie that I saw was LITTLE MAN TATE [lipsmack].

A.5:  Oh, was it good?  

B.6:  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  It was, um, [lipsmack] real popular obviously.
It was about a week after it come out I think.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  And, uh, I didn't really have any, um, [lipsmack] preconceived notions of
what it was going to be about,

A.9:  #Uh-huh [dishes].#

B.10:  #so it# was fun to, I want to tell you about it.  I don't know if I should
though [laughter].

A.11:  Yeah.  Have you seen PARADISE?  [Noise].

B.12:  Um,

A.13:  With, uh, Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson?

B.14:  No, no.  

A.15:  No, I haven't seen that one either.  I was hoping you, well,

B.16:  Let's see what else have you seen recently we can #talk about what we've
both seen?#

A.17:  #Well, I rented,# we rented, my daughter and her friend, I have teenagers
--

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- rented SILENCE OF THE LAMB [noise].

B.20:  Oh.  

A.21:  Have you seen it?  

B.22:  No.  See that,

A.23:  Oh.  It's,

B.24:  That's the kind of film that I probably wouldn't see.  

A.25:  #Yeah.# 

B.26:  #Um,# 

A.27:  #Well, I probably shouldn't have.#

B.28:  #there's certain ones# that my husband and I know that he might see with a
friend and I wouldn't #[laughter] want to.#

A.29:  #Yeah.  I, I don't# know that, I don't know, my husband chose not to watch
it and he obvio-, slept all night and I prayed really hard that my kids
wouldn't have nightmares,

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  and I had nightmares for two nights.  

B.32:  Did you?  

A.33:  Oh,  

B.34:  #Yeah.# 

A.35:  #it's just# it's so interesting.  But it, that is the last one that
[laughter] I saw #on home video.#

B.36:  #And, and# did your kids have any reaction to it?  What were the kind of
comments that they had?

A.37:  Well, I probably shouldn't have let my younger ones watch it.  They are,
um, sev-, uh, nine and eleven --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- years old.  

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  But and especially after this Jeffrey Dahlmer thing really had my eleven
year old going.

B.42:  Oh, boy.  

A.43:  You know, and it was, and he had lots of questions and I had to do a lot of
reassuring but wha-, my kids made some really interesting observations about
how Hannibal the Cannibal, you know --

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- was, uh, playing with this gal's mind.  

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  You know, which was something he was #supposed to,#

B.48:  #They were aware that that,# 

A.49:  watch for and I mean it was very awful.  

B.50:  #Yeah.# 

A.51:  #And,# you know, it teaches them to, um, [breathing] be careful of
strangers and,

B.52:  #Yeah,# 

A.53:  #and (( )),#

B.54:  yeah, I guess there is that in those scary movies there's definitely,

A.55:  #Oh, yeah, so that would,# 

B.56:  #the element of, uh,# caution [laughter].

A.57:  But I have bought FANTASIA for my kids,

B.58:  #You know, I, I would,# 

A.59:  #and myself actually.# 

B.60:  Like that as well.  I, I've been looking for that and I haven't
found it yet but I know that it's, um, [lipsmack] I think it's at no-,
not the warehouse but, uh,

A.61:  Kosco tho-, those kind of places, 

B.62:  #Yeah.# 

A.63:  #kind of# discount places?  Yeah.  

B.64:  Yeah.  Blockbuster Video that's the one that I think I,

A.65:  #Oh, yeah, but you,# 

B.66:  #heard that it was,# 

A.67:  yeah, you can just buy now.  The one I'm buying is a used one which I don't
get until December so people will be using it until December, but I got it for
nine bucks so,

B.68:  #Oh, that's great.# 

A.69:  #you know.# Yeah.  Well, I hope it will be okay.  That's the one movie of
all movies that I'm going to buy.

B.70:  [Laughter] Now, I have to ask you about foreign films.  Have you seen
ANGEL AT MY TABLE?

A.71:  No.  Is it wonderful?  

B.72:  Uh, wh-, it's kind of like MY LEFT FOOT if you had, 

A.73:  #Oh, yes.# 

B.74:  #a chance to see that.# 

A.75:  #Yes, I did see that.# 

B.76:  #it's very much like that.#  You know, it #focuses,# 

A.77:  #Oh.# 

B.78:  on an individual who has, well, in, in her case she's very, very shy.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  Um, and that's not a physical disability but it's certainly a,

A.81:  #Oh, yeah.# 

B.82:  #social emotional# disability,

A.83:  #Sure.# 

B.84:  #in her case.# And it's really beautiful, you know, because it shows how
she blossoms and,

A.85:  #Oh.# 

B.86:  #and about# her, her, her development.  

A.87:  ANGEL AT MY TABLE?  

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  Okay.  

B.90:  Um, #another one,#  

A.91:  #We'll keep an eye out for that one.# 

B.92:  that I really liked was called TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY.  

A.93:  Nope.  

B.94:  I believe it's a British film as well.  And #it came,# 

A.95:  #So you like# foreign films?  

B.96:  Well, there are, there are a couple, th-, they tend to, you know, show up
in San Francisco #[laughter].#

A.97:  #Yes.  Yeah, more than (( ))# Washington I'm afraid [laughter]. 

B.98:  [Laughter] There are a couple theaters that usually show good ones.  You
can count on --

A.99:  Right. 

B.100:  -- them to show (( )) something you, you feel like you might enjoy as
opposed to some,

A.101:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.102:  #that are# so eclectic that you can't really relate to them.  

A.103:  Right [noise].  Right.  

B.104:  And, um, TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY is a love story, 

A.105:  #Oh.# 

B.106:  #about# a person, let's see.  It's her husband that dies.  It came out
shortly after GHOST.

A.107:  #Oh.# 

B.108:  #So, um,# I, 

A.109:  #And GHOST was your, one of your favorite [dishes].#

B.110:  #I kind of, I kind of related# to it a little bit because it, it was about
her husband's love and her love being so strong that he was able to sort of
converse with her after he died.

A.111:  Oh.  

B.112:  In such a way to kind of help her make the separation from his death
because she was having a really hard time grieving,

A.113:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.114:  #for like# a year or so after his death.  

A.115:  And it was called what?  TRULY,

B.116:  TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY.  

A.117:  TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY?   

B.118:  Uh-huh.  That, how,  

A.119:  #Sounds wonderful [noise].#

B.120:  #they used to have a,# a game about how much they loved each other.  They
loved each other truly, no truly madly, no truly, madly, deeply.

A.121:  Oh, I see.  

B.122:  [Laughter]. 

A.123:  Oh, it sounds wonderful.  

B.124:  Yeah, it's a sweet film.  It's actually kind of a, a, a spoof on life after
death because --

A.125:  [Dishes]  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  -- he not only comes back to visit her and help her make the transition
after his death, but he brings all of his, his friends,

A.127:  #His friends.#  

B.128:  #and a lot of them,# 

A.129:  #[Laughter].# 

B.130:  #are you know,# playing cards in her house and -- 

A.131:  Oh.  

B.132:  -- jamming on musical instruments.  

A.133:  Oh.  

B.134:  [Laughter]. 

A.135:  Well, that would be comforting in a way, 

B.136:  #It, it's pretty,# 

A.137:  #you know.# 

B.138:  it's pretty funny.  

A.139:  Oh, well that's great.  Um, what else have I seen?  Oh.  Well, we went to
see, um, and you won't, you don't go see dumb things but it was called
HOTSHOT.  Totally a waste of,

B.140:  Um, HOTSHOT?
