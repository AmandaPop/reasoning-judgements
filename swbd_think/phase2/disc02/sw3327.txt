=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, is it Mike?  

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  Do you repair your own car?  

@B.4:  I try to, whenever I can.  I've always been a, a [lipsmack], I guess a
product of a handyman father.

A.5:  Well, I tell you what, that's, y-, count your blessings because --

B.6:  Th-, 

A.7:  -- uh, it really is good when someone can do some -- 

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  -- things to a car themselves.  

B.10:  Yeah.  There's, a-, although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the
cars get more complicated.

A.11:  Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.  

B.12:  Right, yeah.  

A.13:  Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't
they?  [Barking].

B.14:  Yes.  One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick.  

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  Which, after awhile I could, you know, take it apart in my sleep if I
needed to.

A.17:  Is that right?  

B.18:  Yeah.  It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and, now since
then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know
about it.

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  And then start getting into these Nissans and the like and I just can't
keep up.

A.21:  Yeah, I, I agree.  About all I ever, I never was too mechanically inclined,
but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  Course, they don't use, uh, [noise] points anymore.  

B.24:  That's right [laughter].  

A.25:  But, 

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  [Laughter] Uh, they do still use plugs.  

B.28:  Yeah. 

A.29:  And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  [Lipsmack]  And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know,
and starter.

B.32:  Yes.  

A.33:  I don't anymore, but I have on a lot, a lot of times.  

B.34:  Yes, I understand.  My last car repair actually had to do with brakes and
it's one I did not do myself.  I took the car, my, I have a seventy-nine El
Dorado, took it to be inspected --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- and the parking brake failed.  So I got under there and messed with the,
the ten-, that, uh, that adjustment --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- to make, to t-, tighten it up and -- 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- that didn't do the trick and then I got there and tried to,

A.41:  It probably slipped loose, didn't it?

B.42:  Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.  I, I did a lot of
things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes --

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  -- and it turns out that there's a, the parking brake i-, in the rear,
there's a, there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston deal.

A.47:  Um.  

B.48:  And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston
froze up.

A.49:  Oh. 

B.50:  So they ended up having to pound it out.  And one of them, they,

A.51:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.52:  were able to get running, uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it and the
other one they just, it was just frozen solid, so I ended up having to buy one
and altog-, all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or
not, to get all that done [laughter].

A.53:  Y-, well, it really wasn't quite, s-, as bad as you thought, was it, was
it?

B.54:  Y-, yeah, actually, I, I think it was a lot of money, but I, I don't, like
I s-, 

A.55:  Well, it was a lot of money, but,   

B.56:  Yeah, but, I, it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on so,

A.57:  You had to have the help, didn't you?  

B.58:  That's right, that's right.  

A.59:  Yeah.  Well, do you still do much work on them, then?  

B.60:  I do.  Th-, act-, th-, actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of
September and, whenever I can, I do try.  I [throat_clearing] a-, actually,
I'd say this.  I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil
anymore.  Only because,

A.61:  Disposal is a problem.  

B.62:  Well, that is one problem, but also these, uh, these fast oil change
places, you just can't beat them.

A.63:  That's true.  

B.64:  For sixteen bucks they'll -- 

A.65:  That's true.  

B.66:  -- not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a f-, you know,
as good a job as I can do, but they'll, uh, lube, too [noise].

A.67:  Right, that, that, I've, I've quit doing that myself.  

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  And, but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.

B.70:  Yep, that's right.  

A.71:  [Lipsmack]  And, uh, but, it, but, no, I guess, i-, that, and the main
reason that it's, it's quick.
