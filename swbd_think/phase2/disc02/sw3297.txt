A.1:   Credit cards is one of my [laughter],  

B.2:   [Laughter]. 

@A.3:   wonderful topics.  Uh, do you have quite a few or,   

B.4:   I got rid of mine about, uh, oh, it's been about four years
ago now.  

A.5:   Okay.  

B.6:   And, uh, went on a strictly cash basis.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   And, sometimes it's inconvenient, but -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- it is so much better for me.  

A.11:   It is.  

B.12:   Because I, I am the type that will always find an emergency
[laughter].  

A.13:   Oh, [breathing] me, too [laughter].  

B.14:   But, I have found that there were so many things that, with
a credit card, y-, I really did need.  

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   And with cash, once, you know, it took me probably two years
to get on a cash basis when I stopped charging.  

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   But once, once I did, you know, it, it only takes me two or
three months to be able to save up what I want to buy.  

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   And I'm not paying the high interest rates.  

A.21:   That's what kills you on those credit cards.  

B.22:   Because it's so easy, you know, you have these wonderful
intentions of, well, I'll just pay off the whole balance and then
I won't owe any.  

A.23:   Uh-huh.  

B.24:   And then something comes up, you know, and, well, I'll just
pay the minimum.  

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   Well, you just do that forever.  

A.27:   Oh, and, and with the interest charge on the credit cards,
you're not getting anywhere -- 

B.28:   No, you're #paying the interest.# 

A.29:   -- #because you're paying# your interest every [breathing]
month and that's all you're doing.  And with our Visa, that's
really high interest.  We're in the process of transferring from
one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the
cards, so that somehow we can get ahead on that.  But,  

B.30:   You know, I've, I've thought about going ahead and getting
something like American Express --  

A.31:   Yes.  

B.32:   -- where you have to pay within thirty days.  

A.33:   Yes, pay the balance at the end of the month.  

B.34:   Right.  

A.35:   Uh-huh.  

B.36:   And, just for I D purposes.  

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   But, it's become such a way of life.  

A.39:   Oh, it has.  

B.40:   And, like, see, it was so convenient, and then pretty soon,
you get a consolidation loan -- 

A.41:   Uh-huh.  

B.42:   -- to consolidate all your credit cards -- 

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   -- and then they send you another credit card [laughter].  

A.45:   They [laughter], I know, like you paid that one off, now
here's another [laughter].  

B.46:   Right.  

A.47:   When really you're paying a loan for the other one.  

B.48:   So I've, I just finally figured out that for my way of life,
I did much better.  And I've, I've been able to buy as much or 
more -- 

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   -- by just going cash.  And, like I say, it was tough --

A.51:   Uh-huh.

B.52:   -- because it's a really, it's a habit.  

A.53:   It is, because you think, oh, I'll get this and just pay it
off later [noise].  

B.54:   Or, you know, you'll think, okay, I've got X amount to spend
this month and then somebody [breathing] has a birthday or get,
they get married or something.  

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   That, well, I'll just put this one thing on it.  

A.57:   Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.58:   Well, you don't do that once you start.  

A.59:   No.  

B.60:   You know you're going to have a bill coming in anyway.  

A.61:   Uh-huh.  Might as well just, yeah, like you said, there's a
lot of things that I could probably do without that I don't do
without because I have credit card.  

B.62:   Right.  

A.63:   You know.  And, uh,  

B.64:   And I, I just, you know, for, for me, it was a trap that was
too easy for me to get into.  

A.65:   Uh-huh {very faint}.  Yeah, uh, my husband and I just moved
from South Dakota to, uh, Plano, Texas and, uh, that was the thing
that helped us get down here and that's what we're trying to get
down on that, because the credit card helped us move because we had
just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of
more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving
expenses.   

B.66:   Uh-huh.  

A.67:   But, now we're in the process of trying to get that down, too.
But it, it did help in that kind of a situation.  

B.68:   Well -- 

A.69:   But, uh,  

B.70:   -- you know, there are times when, you know, it is, but I,
I've been laid off twice in the last four years.  

A.71:   Oh, really?  

B.72:   And had I had a lot of credit cards,  

A.73:   You're stuck.  

B.74:   I wou-, well, you know, it, it really helped that I didn't
have that to pay for.  

A.75:   Right.  

B.76:   But, in the other vain, had I had them, I would have lived on
them.  

A.77:   Uh-huh, yeah, because you didn't have any other income.  

B.78:   Right.  

A.79:   Yeah.  

B.80:   And, uh, this way, you know, I, I made do.  

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   And, uh, when I was, you know, employed, then I didn't have
all that that I had to go back and say, well, I've got ten thousand
dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now.  

A.83:   Right.  And that, that's good.  That's a good feeling --  

B.84:   It really --

A.85:   -- you know, to know.

B.86:   -- you know, with the first, like I say, it took me over two
years to pay mine off -- 

A.87:   Uh-huh.  

B.88:   -- but the first time, you know, that I could go out and make
a major purchase,  

A.89:   And pay cash.  

B.90:   And pay cash, it was a real good feeling.  

A.91:   I bet.
