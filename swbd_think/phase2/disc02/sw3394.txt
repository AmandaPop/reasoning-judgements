========================================================================

A.1:  Do,

B.2:  Well, the magazines that I subscribe to are, I, I'm, I don't know if you're
familiar with BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.

A.3:  Yeah, I familiar --

B.4:  Okay.

A.5:  -- a little bit.

B.6:  And, um, SESAME STREET [laughter].

A.7:  SESAME STREET.  Yeah, we've had that one before --

B.8:  Okay.

A.9:  -- and, uh, I don't presently subscribe to any.  I think we've, I've
subscribed to SPORTS ILLUSTRATED --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and, um, I think we've taken SESAME STREET actually before --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- and, um.

B.14:  That's the big hit in this, in this house --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- the SESAME STREET, because they have, um, you know, the calendars and
that kind of thing.  But I take the recipes and the home gardening and the
furnishings from BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  So. 

A.19:  Do, uh, do you, do you read it, all the way through every --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- how often does it come out.

B.22:  Uh, once a month --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- and I, yeah, I read it all the way through, more than once, and my
husband, I'll find him reading that too.

A.25:  Oh, yeah.

B.26:  So.

A.27:  Huh.

B.28:  And it's a free subscription, my mother gave it to us, so. 

A.29:  Oh, well, that's the --

B.30:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.31:  -- the best kind.  Oh, oh, we've, uh, I've had SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.  We had
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC when it was free.  My, my mother got that for us.  It was
free.  So, we, and, uh, but, um, I guess I found, um, I li-, I like reading
them, but I, I never seem to ha-, because, see, uh, the SPORTS ILLUSTRATED is
weekly --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and it, I just didn't seem to have time to sit down and read it.

B.34:  Oh, we, we're always reading magazines because we, we don't really
subscribe to them.  We usually buy them off the rack --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- and we're always buying LIFE, and PEOPLE, and, um, a few others, I
can't, really, but, we're, we're, we're always reading magazines --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- in this house.  And, oh, and TIME --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- TIME, and, uh, so what, we're always reading magazines in this house.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  And, um, we saved all the TIME MAGAZINES from the, um, from when, um, we
went to war --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- so we have all of those.

A.45:  Huh, you have a whole collection from the Gulf war.

B.46:  Uh-huh, well, we, yeah, we saved them.  We thought maybe --

A.47:  Well, that's a good idea.

B.48:  -- maybe they'd, you know, be useful --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- later on in life --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- when the boys grow up, because we have.

A.53:  Yeah.  Do you get LIFE every month?

B.54:  Um, no, the, we don't subscribe to those.  We just get them --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- like maybe --

A.57:  When it looks interesting.

B.58:  -- yeah.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  Uh-huh, maybe once every three months or something like that, but.

A.61:  I haven't gotten a copy of that in, well, actually, I don't know, my
parents used to take it --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- and, uh, when it was weekly --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and that was, I used to read it all the time then.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  And I really haven't looked at it much since it went monthly except in the
grocery line, picking it up and looking,

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  looking at the pictures in it, looked --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- looked interesting.  

B.72:  Uh, my husband is the kind of person that prefers the, um, what do you call
those, the, THE SUN, and, um, THE STAR [barking], you know those (( ))
[laughter].

A.73:  Oh, yeah, those, the tabloid things.

B.74:  [Laughter] Yeah --

A.75:  Oh.

B.76:  -- he lov-, he loves those.

A.77:  Does he really?

B.78:  He'll read, he'll read those all the time.

A.79:  And, and, and, and you, and you fess up to it, huh [laughter].

B.80:  No, I just,

A.81:  [Laughter]. 

B.82:  I don't, I don't read them.

A.83:  But you admit your husband does.

B.84:  [Laughter] Yeah.  He does all the time.

A.85:  Isn't that funny?  Huh.

B.86:  And he'll sneak one home every once in a while in the grocery --

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  -- cart, but that's just, I don't know, those are things I don't really, I
don't know, I don't really find interesting.  I don't bel-, and he'll show me
an article that (( )) I don't believe it anyway --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- so.  

A.91:  I glance at them in line.

B.92:  [Laughter].

A.93:  But the stories are so ridiculous, you know, I mean, uh.

B.94:  That's what he does.  He'll stand in line and just laugh.

A.95:  Seven year old gives birth to twins.

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  And, um, uh, uh, ninety-nine year old, uh --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- elopes with ten ye-, I mean, you know, I just, huh.

B.100:  [Laughter] Yeah, well, he, he loves all of those, yeah, so those are his
kind of.  Great role model for the kids, I guess [laughter].

A.101:  Uh-huh.  I read, um, the newspaper like every day, and I guess, um, as I
was thinking about it before, I guess what I like about the magazine is the,
uh, they'll cover the same material sort of --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- but more, more, um, more in depth --

B.104:  Yeah, uh-huh.

A.105:  -- and more thought out --

B.106:  Yeah.

A.107:  -- and more the whole picture instead of just, you know, one little.

B.108:  We usually just get, get the newspaper on weekends --

A.109:  Yeah.

B.110:  -- because we really don't have time during the week, but we usually get
Friday's, Saturday's and Sunday's --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- and that's really about it.  But, uh, we read like the DALLAS LIFE
MAGAZINE, you know, in there, and --

A.113:  Uh-huh.

B.114:  -- those kind of pretty interesting, so.  I mean, just talking to you I, I,
I realize how much we read.  I didn't really realize that.  That's just
amazing.

A.115:  So it sounds like you read quite a bit really.

B.116:  We do, now that I think about it, we do read a lot, so.

A.117:  Almost, I've gotten to where I don't get one unless I'm on a trip, a
magazine.

B.118:  Oh, really.

A.119:  Yeah, just --

B.120:  Oh.

A.121:  -- just about, I mean, I pick up, when I'm going somewhere I'll pick up a
PEOPLE and --

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  -- and, uh, usually a SPORTS ILLUSTRATED --

B.124:  Yeah.

A.125:  -- and, uh, occasionally I go to the library and, and, uh, and, uh, you
know, they have all the current ones every --

B.126:  Yeah.

A.127:  -- every week, and I'll sit down and --

B.128:  Yeah.

A.129:  -- and read them --

B.130:  Yeah.

A.131:  -- read them there.

B.132:  That's a good idea.  Yeah --

A.133:  Yeah.

B.134:  -- I've only done it once, but.

A.135:  Well, I, uh, I've got teenage kids, so I, you know, they're usually there
doing stuff, and I'm, and --
