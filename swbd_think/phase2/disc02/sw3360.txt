========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I guess my personal opinion, I, I don't mind paying taxes
necessarily.  I, I just sometimes wonder if our money is being
used in the best way.

B.2:  Right.

A.3:  Uh, sometimes when I hear what, what they're, even what, even
what the politicians are making, you know, when they're getting a
hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that, uh, I think
that's just a bit too much to be paying them, uh, and that's all
tax money.  When you figure out how many politicians and each one
getting that much, it's just billions of dollars that's, I think
is just being thrown away.

B.4:  Right, right.  And then when you read about that they're
spending all the money on, you know, these studies that have no
relevance whatsoever, that kind of ticks you off, too.  

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  But, uh, somebody, somebody was telling me the other day that
they heard some senator say that what we're paying, it's not that
we mind paying taxes, it's that we're paying too much for a lousy
government.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  And I, I, I tend to agree with that [laughter].

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  I'm not really into what they're doing --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- per se, and I think there's just too many, too many levels
of bureaucracy.  I think it can be, can be managed by less, uh,
less levels.

A.13:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I know any time there's, there's a big,
uh, budget cut, you know, I work with the state, and any time
there's, there is a budget cut or crunches, it's always the small
guy that, that gets hurt.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  It's never the, uh, the person that's making a hundred
thousand there.  It's always the person that's making the least
amount, and --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- uh, and sometimes we're running around there.  I see
these, these, uh, supervisors running around, uh, having
meetings.  I, I really don't know what they do.

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  I sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything, or,

B.20:  Right, well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the
government.  I just, you know, I, I don't know what kind of, uh,
I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take
for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to
start saying, Hey, this is too much.  We're not going to pay any
more.  You know, we're not going to pay for this, and you're out,
you know.  I think we're starting to see it a little bit now, but
I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to
get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it. 
Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much.  

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably
around thirty-five percent, or more.  And that's, that's, you
know, that's me not making a whole lot of money.

A.23:  Yeah.  Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really
hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a
grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little
tax here and you --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- so.  Gas, I don't know about you guys, but there's
probably at least about twenty-five to, to thirty cents of
different taxes on, on our gas.

B.26:  Right.  

A.27:  And you don't realize,

B.28:  Yeah, we got a sales tax.  Our sales tax is like eight
percent, and I don't know what our gas tax is.  I think it's
somewhere around [child_talking] twenty five cents a gallon.

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  So.  I mean, they're hitting us up, and they may not raise
it, you know, federally as much one year, but then they'll raise
it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or
whatever.  It's just, I mean, you can see that you're money is
just not [laughter] going that far.

A.31:  Yeah.  Well, I know they say like with Reagan, they say no
new taxes, but they changed the, uh, deductions on you, and that
just raises your taxes, you know, they just get it a different
way --

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  -- so, I mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes.

B.34:  Right, well, I mean, you [child_talking] could tell just by,
just by how much money you have left over, and all of a sudden, I
don't know [breathing], it's just, it's eating me alive.

A.35:  Yeah, I heard someone say that, uh, if they would just,
something about with the, uh, the defense budget, all that extra
money they're throwing back, if they cut back by so much
percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an
average, six hundred dollars,
