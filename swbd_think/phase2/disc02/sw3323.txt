A.1:  Okay.  

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  I think we can talk now [laughter]. 

B.4:  Well, we're supposed to talk about,  

A.5:  [Cough] The family.  

B.6:  Okay.  

A.7:  And what,   

B.8:  Things, things you like to do with your kids, right?  

A.9:  That's right.  And I bet you like to ski with your kids.  

B.10:  I bet I do.  And I,  

A.11:  Now, how did I know that?  

B.12:  I, I don't know and you're from Texas and you know what, it is snowing, we
have a, three inches of snow on the ground.

A.13:  Oh, [breathing] #it's been raining# -- 

B.14:  #It's so cold.#  

A.15:  -- here all day.  

B.16:  Oh. 

A.17:  But,  

B.18:  Is it cold?  Like what, sixties?  

A.19:  Yeah, probably sixty.  

B.20:  Oh, gee.  

A.21:  [Laughter]. 

B.22:  It is supposed to be eighteen degrees tonight.  I was thinking about you on
the way home from our class.

A.23:  Oh. 

B.24:  Just got home from our computer class.  

A.25:  Oh. 

B.26:  Hey, what are the chances of this happening?   

A.27:  Jeez, I don't know.  

B.28:  How many people do you think?  

A.29:  Oh, I don't know, there's got to be thousands.  

B.30:  I think.  Oh, that is just too funny.  

A.31:  That's wonderful [laughter].  

B.32:  Oh, isn't that great.  That's just wonderful.  Well, I wrote you a little
letter on the latest update so,

A.33:  Oh, good.  

B.34:  Yeah, yeah.

A.35:  Yes.

B.36:  They, they have a board meeting tomorrow, so we may know more tomorrow, but
anyway, just, [breathing] for now, you know, it's just, anyway, it's in the
letter.

A.37:  Oh, good.  Yes,   

B.38:  So, and your rejuvenating cream, so, 

A.39:  I've been wondering about that.  

B.40:  I know you have been and I just couldn't talk last night.  

A.41:  I know.  

B.42:  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  I know.  And we'll, I need to give you that number, too.  But that's one
thing we should do, pray with our kids, right?

B.44:  Oh, oh, you have to.  In fact, when Nicole was having her problems with not
starting, you know, we prayed a lot and we prayed as a family on the way to
the tournament.  What night did we, I guess on the way to the ((SELA)) game
last Thursday which, they're kind of our big rivals.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  And we p-, prayed that she would get to start and that she would play well
and she did.  She played the best I've seen her play.

A.47:  Oh. 

B.48:  And as consistent as I've seen her play, and, but we prayed as a family.
We, I made all the kids go because, you know, all, they, boys sometimes don't
like to go, and it was just great.  And her little friend was there.  And, in
fact, I've got to talk to her and, we just got home and, to see if she talked
to him today and stuff, because see, he had a soccer tournament out of town
yesterday --

A.49:  Oh. 

B.50:  -- so he had to get up at six o'clock in the morning and they got home at
one thirty [laughter].

A.51:  Oh, jeez.  

B.52:  I told you, she just ran in the house.  

A.53:  Yeah, uh, yes.  Oh. 

B.54:  Okay, and, let's see, and, what you like to do with your kids is go to
their sports.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  Basketball.  

A.57:  Yeah, tennis.  

B.58:  Orchestra, tennis.  

A.59:  Orchestra, yes.  Uh, watch them #dance.#  

B.60:  #Golf.#  

A.61:  Golf, yeah, racquetball.  We do a lot of things --

B.62:  Yep.

A.63:  -- with our kids [laughter].  

B.64:  Is Dave, is Dave playing racquetball?

A.65:  We haven't played yet this year, but, you know, the, the park and rec
center that's right beside us, you know, it doesn't cost you anything [noise]
if the court isn't reserved, you can play for free.

B.66:  Oh, that's great.  How's Barry doing with his weight, is he working out?

A.67:  Oh, [breathing] no, he hasn't had time.  

B.68:  Yeah, he's, he's going to be a while getting settled.  

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  You know, getting things going.  

A.71:  They're putting in a new dialogue system at the university and so he's been
working nights and, you know, he's been really, really busy.

B.72:  Oh, bless his heart.  

A.73:  But,  

B.74:  This lady over D W, she's so bad.  

A.75:  Oh. 

B.76:  Keep your, keep your -- 

A.77:  I know [noise]. 

B.78:  -- keep your ears and eyes open.  

A.79:  Well, this is a good steppingstone for him.  

B.80:  It's a great stepping stone.  It's a great stepping stone.  

A.81:  Yeah, so we're real proud of him.  

B.82:  Oh, I got a one hundred percent on my test!  

A.83:  What test?  

B.84:  My test for my class, my computer class that -- 

A.85:  Oh. 

B.86:  -- Dan and I are going to.  

A.87:  Whoa.  

B.88:  We got them back, this is from last week, so we're, I'm pretty jazzed,
because I got a eighty-two on the first one and Dan got a ninety-two,

A.89:  [Breathing]. 

B.90:  and so [laughter], and then we both got a one hundred on this last one
and I thought it was harder than the first one, but we studied a lot more so,

A.91:  Oh. 

B.92:  Yeah, we're pretty jazzed.  

A.93:  That's wonderful.  

B.94:  Yeah, tonight we learn spreadsheets.  

A.95:  Oh, see, 

B.96:  And last week we, the last three weeks we've been doing data base.

A.97:  Now we've, I work with a spreadsheet at work.

B.100:  #It's pretty darn neat.#  

A.101:  Yeah, they are neat.  They're -- 

B.102:  Oh. 

A.103:  -- scary at first, but, they're neat.  

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  And you need to be teaching your kids that stuff because it will really
help them.

B.106:  Oh, yeah, well, we're just really basic, basic, basic stuff, you know.

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  And our teacher, his wife is the teach-, one of the teaching leaders of the
Bible Study Fellowship.

A.109:  Oh. 

B.110:  Yeah, and I, and I've had her been and I thought I recognized the name.
Oh, he's just the most wonderful man and we weren't even in his class to start
with and then it just, I mean, the way God works, you know, we ended up in his
class and we just couldn't be happier.

A.111:  Oh, that's wonderful.  

B.112:  I mean, he's just a marvelous teacher.  

A.113:  That's wonderful.
