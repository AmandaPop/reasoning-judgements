========================================================================

A.1:  Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, 

B.2:  [Laughter].

@A.3:  since I am a, am a healthy eater,

B.4:  [Laughter] Well, I, I try to be as well,

A.5:  [Laughter] Well, I'm not, uh, I, there really isn't any kind of
particular food that I, I don't, don't like really, and I like a good Italian
restaurant --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- or a good, uh, uh, especially like good prime rib --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,
and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York, and there are a lot of good
restaurants around here.

B.10:  Oh, you're in New York, I was going to, there's a place, if you ever make
it to Dallas --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- they have the best prime rib.  It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's
seasoning salt --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- and it is absolutely wonderful.

A.15:  Really.

B.16:  And, uh, we were there a few months ago, and it, I mean, it's kind of
pricey, well, from New York it probably doesn't matter, but [laughter].

A.17:  Oh, no, I'm in upstate New York, and it's actually very inexpensive, I,
there's a --

B.18:  Oh, is it, okay.

A.19:  -- there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh,
fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars --

B.20:  Wow.

A.21:  -- for a whole meal, you know --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards, so that,

B.24:  Yeah, well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen, and it
includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff, but --

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  -- it is absolutely wonderful.  It's the best I have ever had.

A.27:  Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever
had, so,

B.28:  Yeah [laughter].

A.29:  I'll have to go there when I get to --

B.30:  Well,

A.31:  -- get to Dallas.

B.32:  Yeah, well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food --

A.33:  Uh-huh, sure.

B.34:  -- so, um, that's, I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my
favorites.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  But, um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff.

A.37:  No, no, I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,
but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and
things like that, uh --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- that they, uh, I go on, I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite
a bit on business --

B.40:  Oh, okay.

A.41:  -- so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a
month, once every two months or so --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and, uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit --

B.44:  Oh, yeah --

A.45:  -- but, I love that,

B.46:  -- fresh seafood down there,

A.47:  Yeah, and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great, you get the crabs --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- it's like, I can't go anywhere where I [laughter] --

B.50:  Yeah [laughter].

A.51:  -- where I don't enjoy myself, so,

B.52:  Yeah, seafood seems to be a lit-, a little bit more expensive than, than
other types of food.

A.53:  That's true.

B.54:  But it sure is good, and it's supposed to be good for you.

A.55:  Yeah, well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so
expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans
have the greatest re-, resource of food --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- on the planet, and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out
a way to harvest it economically --

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  -- [Laughter] so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about
everything else, but, uh, 

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  but not, uh, not seafood.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  Do you like spicy foods or,

A.63:  Yeah, yeah, I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili and around here the big
spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings --

B.64:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.65:  -- and so, uh, it, people, they, you know, you go out to get the chicken
wings and those are really hot --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- and the hotter the better,

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  [Laughter].

B.70:  Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce,
Picante sauce, or salsa --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- whatever you all call it --

A.73:  Sure.

B.74:  -- and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  But I like it hot, but I don't like it real hot --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- because then my nose starts running [laughter].

A.79:  My, generally my, my scalp will start, I can feel just the top of my scalp
getting hot, 

B.80:  [Laughter].

A.81:  [Laughter] the weirdest, weirdest sensation, 

B.82:  [Laughter].

A.83:  almost like a tingling, but, uh, I don't know, but, uh, yeah, well,
there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine, I never been
really fond of that stuff.  You talk about spicy, that'll, that'll literally
blow your head off, it's so hot.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um,
well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, 

B.88:  [Laughter].

A.89:  my tolerances,

B.90:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.91:  So.  Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a
restaurant is always nice though, too --

B.92:  Oh, yeah,

A.93:  -- #that's one thing,#

B.94:  #and the price.#

A.95:  What's that?

B.96:  And the price.

A.97:  Yeah,

B.98:  Make you want to come back.

A.99:  Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working
waitressing jobs or waiter,
