=============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, well, I, I kind of feel like we pay, um, um, maybe a li-, uh, too much,
actually, I mean, like twenty-five, thirty percent of our income --

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- the average family you know --

B.4:  Yes, absolutely.

A.5:  -- and it just seems, uh, um, and yet you have big corporations that, that
manage, just because the way the laws are written, not to pay anything at all
--

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- year after year after year.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, no, I agree with you there.  Um, I've gone to other states
where there's no food tax, you know, some things that aren't taxed at all --

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- and I think that that's really nice.  I think they, that's what Texas
needed to do also is to discriminate as to, uh, which should be taxed and what
shouldn't be taxed.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  So.

A.13:  I don't, I've never been any place that didn't have it.  We went from here
to North Carolina for a while --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- and they had a food tax there.  So I guess I'm just kind of, well, see,
we don't, they don't food here, do they.

B.16:  No, they do.

A.17:  They do ta-,

B.18:  They do, uh-huh, yeah, but I have lived in other states in which they
don't, uh, tax, uh, food --

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  -- clothing, items, personal things like that --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- and, um, so that was, that was really neat.  But I guess the way that
they get around it, though, is that there's no quote state income tax.

A.23:  No state income tax, right.

B.24:  But then you pay [laughter] ten, fifteen percent taxes --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- um, you know, I know that that's only eight and a quarter or whatever it
is, but, uh --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- but yeah, I really think there's, it's way too much. 

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  Whenever you buy an item, especially a large purchase item, it's, it's
something in which you, you're paying, and you've always got to add in that
about ten percent tax [laughter].

A.31:  Uh-huh.  What do you feel about, do you feel like, um, how do you feel
about for what we get back in the way of services and things?

B.32:  In the last what?

A.33:  In, in the way of services for, for the money that we pay.

B.34:  Oh, the money that we pay?

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Um, well, now for the City of Plano, um, I really like the, the things that
they offer here.

A.37:  Yeah, I do too.

B.38:  Um, I, and I can't say that for all of Dallas or all of Texas --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- um, but for Plano, I do, I really think that I get my, my money's worth.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Uh, we seem to be ahead of any other, um, city in, in the things such as,
uh, you know, separating out your glass and your paper now, and having the
great big, you know, gallon drums, uh, keeping Plano beautiful, and I think
that they really do a good job at it, too.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  So, yeah.

A.45:  Yeah, well, we participate in a lot of the recrea-, you know, use the
recreational facilities --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and, uh, [throat_clearing] where we came from in North Carolina, I mean,
it was a nice area, but we didn't, I mean the, the rec-, recreational
facilities they have here are just unbelievable.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  So, I think that we get a good deal --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- in the way that goes.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  Well, and I think you get spoiled, and you expect it whenever you
go to any place else and it's just not quite up to standard or par, and it's
just like, oh, gee whiz, you know, it makes you really appreciate, I think,
uh, you know, your city and what it has to offer.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Now as for the state, you know, I, uh, uh, you know, I guess the, the
highways outside of what, metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay?
[Laughter].

A.55:  I don't know, I, I haven't been much, I haven't been much outside.

B.56:  [Laughter].

A.57:  Uh, yeah, I used to travel when I was here, and they seem to be okay.

B.58:  Yeah, the outside, I mean --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- the state highways I, I think, you know, are pretty a-, uh, adequate --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- but gosh you get into the cities and [laughter] --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- might as well forget it.  Um.

A.65:  Yeah, now we lived in Houston for a while (( )) --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- and in the city was pretty, pretty, pretty rough --

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  -- in places.

B.70:  Right.  

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  Yeah. So, um, I, I don't know, I'm, I'm really glad that they didn't go to
the, um, the, the state income tax.  Um, I'm hoping the lottery is going to,
uh, take care of it.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  Uh, I know that there's a lot of religious issues and et cetera, um, but I,
I'm hoping that, uh, in a way, people can, can see that as a contribution then
to the state.  Um, I did live in Ohio for a couple of years, and I know that's
how they kind of got around, um, you know, having to, uh, taxes, or increase
in taxes was, was by the lottery.

A.75:  Is that right?

B.76:  Yeah, yeah.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  And, and I know the people are concerned that it's only going to be the
lower, you know, income people who are actually going to, you know, be the,
the biggest participants in this.  Um.

A.79:  Yeah, so some of those folks probably say you're taxing them anyway then if
you're --

B.80:  Right.

A.81:  -- dangling a lottery out there in front of them.

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  Yeah, ab-, absolutely, and, um, I only saw it as being, you know, really
positive, and of course, it, you know, was just a fluke if you won, because I
really never expected to win and, and I never did, the big, big lottery we're
talking about.

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  Uh, but you know, every once in a while I'd come up with two or three
dollars or something --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- but I felt good in the sense that I was really putting my money, the way
I felt it was, back into, uh, the taxes --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- and it went, actually most of it went to the schools, and, uh, to school
reforms, things like this.  So, uh, yeah, I, I felt really the positive thing.

A.91:  Yeah.  How do you feel about, um, federal services and things?

B.92:  [Laughter].

A.93:  What, what are the federal services?

B.94:  Yeah, uh, yeah.

A.95:  What do we, I mean, I know we got a big army and, and, you know, uh, I
guess, I guess they have matching federal funds for a lot of our state and
local projects.

B.96:  Right, well because I was looking at some of the services that I actually
use.  Now I did, um, uh, way back when, I did use government, uh, things such
as, uh, uh, food stamps,
