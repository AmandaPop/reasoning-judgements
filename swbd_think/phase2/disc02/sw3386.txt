B.1:   Well, Sid, have you established what kind of requirements you
are looking for, for your next vehicle?   

A.2:   [Lipsmack] Well, I don't know if I really have [laughter] a,
a lot of, uh, requirements.  Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the
best deal.  

B.3:   [Noise]. 

A.4:   Uh, that's my main objectives normally.  Whoever is willing to
deal and, and give me a good price.   

B.5:   Okay.  Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess.  Uh, I
determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for,
whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a
personal mover.  Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what
types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily
highway or, or local mileage more often.  And, uh, hanging in the
back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars
for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand
miles.  

A.6:   {Very faint} Uh-huh.  

B.7:   So I'm, I'm real picky.  I-, if you are going to keep
something that long, [laughter] you know, you better get something
that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a
long time.  

A.8:   Yeah.  I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know, even
if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh,
you are going to get some good life out of it.  Uh, my, my
Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty
thousand and it's still in pretty good shape.  Uh, there was a flaw
in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke, and it cost me
some bucks to, to fix that but that was, you know, something that
was unforeseen.  But I still think I c-, I'm going to get probably
a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it.  

B.9:   Sure.  Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite
a ways also then.  

A.10:   Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but,
uh, but not FROM PASADENA. 

B.11:   [Laughter]. 

A.12:   But, uh, yeah, I, I baby them as much as I possibly can.  Uh,
it's a pretty big expense nowadays.  Uh, and I guess I like to take
care of it, uh, so I don't have to buy one too often.  

B.13:   That's true.  Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in
your fleet?  Uh, do you have a family fleet or, 

A.14:   Yeah, I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury
that, uh, doesn't want to die on me so I, I just keep running the
thing.  Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits, but
it just doesn't seem to want to.  I'll probably have, uh, three,
four hundred thousand before it wants to die.  

B.15:   Well, that may be.  They, Chrysler made some really good old
engines back then like the, the three eighteen was particularly an
exceptionally good engine. 

A.16:   ((Oh.))  I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler
but it runs good.  

B.17:   Yeah.  At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac ((Cimarron)) which
is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new
Plymouth Voyager.  It's only a, a couple of years old.  But that's
the second one of, of those that we've had, and that's the, the
family travel vehicle.  You know, not only does it do all the, the,
uh, carpooling around during the week, but it's also the vacation
vehicle that we all drive in.  I think that what I'm getting ready
to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change
the, the vehicle a lot.  Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do
get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the
problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better
to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit
and that kind of stuff.  

A.18:   Yeah.  

B.19:   Just because I can't see, you know, I'm to, my ((Cimarron)) is
just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any
vehicle [laughter], 

A.20:   #Yeah.# 

B.21:   #that's in# front of me.  

A.22:   Yeah.  Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup
truck myself for the next vehicle.  Uh, I just have so many hauling
projects a lot of times and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing
some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around.  I just feel that,
