==========================================================================

A.1:  Seem to have the topic already on top of th-, tip of your tongue there so
why don't you go ahead and start.

B.2:  Yeah.  Isn't the, uh, the subject auto repair,

@A.3:  Yes, sir.  

B.4:  for tonight?  Yeah.  That's great.  The reason I say that is pretty timely
because just tonight I went out and changed the oil in my car and,

A.5:  Okay.  

B.6:  that's something I like to do and, uh, something I, something I can do with
now the sophisticated auto,

A.7:  Right, exactly.  

B.8:  cars we have today with all the computers and everything.  

A.9:  [Laughter]. 

B.10:  It's, uh, and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and
electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car, but I do like to get out
and tinker with a car and it's something I can do still.  Do you enjoy working
with your car?

A.11:  I sure do.  I, uh, in fact, the last thing I have, I've done I, I don't
even remember what it is.  I've had to have oil changes done myself because I
live in an apartment complex,

B.12:  [Laughter]. 

A.13:  where we are not allowed to, 

B.14:  Oh, dear.  

A.15:  work on our vehicle.  We can't even wash our vehicle, so.  

B.16:  Oh, that's too bad.  

A.17:  Uh, but the last thing I can remember doing wh-, I had a sixty-six Mustang,

B.18:  Oh.  

A.19:  and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days,
I guess.

B.20:  Oh, yes.  

A.21:  And, uh, you know, you could do a lot of it yourself still, and, uh, I
didn't tinker too much with the engine.  It was, it was in pretty good shape,
but my main concern and what I enjoy doing was, was the interior.

B.22:  Oh.  

A.23:  And, uh, it was, it was pretty shelled, uh, but it was fun.  It was taking
the whole thing, you know, the whole interior apart and, you know, ordering
new carpeting and, uh,

B.24:  And did you install all that yourself?  

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  Well, that was, 

A.27:  And, 

B.28:  I bet that was a lot of fun.  

A.29:  It, it was.  I, my wife enjoyed, uh, she, you know, helped out a little.
We sanded down the, the insides of the door panels.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  And painted, 

B.32:  Wow.  

A.33:  those and,

B.34:  Do you still have the car?  

A.35:  No, I sold it.  

B.36:  Well, that's too bad.  A sixty-seven Chev-, uh, Mustang is about the, uh,
top, [noise] top year for the Mustang [laughter] car.

A.37:  Yeah, it was fun though.  It was fun.  I, I really enjoyed it, and I was
surprised at, at, uh, the availability of parts yet.

B.38:  Yes.  

A.39:  You know, you can, you can still get factory original parts. 

B.40:  Huh.  

A.41:  But, uh, you pay a premium but you just don't get them.  I, I didn't.  I
went ahead and got, you know, Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were
made, Canada.

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  You know, prefabs and all that stuff but,

B.44:  Well, you know, that's, that's fine.  I, I don't think that there would be,
uh, [breathing] you know, a, a quality difference.  I don't know.  You
wouldn't, you didn't notice the difference, did you?

A.45:  Well, actually there was.  

B.46:  Oh.  

A.47:  And, uh, I had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate
[throat_clearing] certain patterns, uh, exactly.

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  And so like the, the glove box was just a little,

B.50:  [Laughter]. 

A.51:  little wider, 

B.52:  Oh, dear.

A.53:  little harder to fit in, and --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- the carpeting, uh, stretched a little too far.  I had to cut some of the
sides down.

B.56:  Oh, dear.  

A.57:  But just, just little things.  You know, one of the screws on, on the door
regulat-, uh, window regulators you could get three of the, three of the four
to lineup.  The fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did.

B.58:  Oh, 

A.59:  You know, thin-,

B.60:  I bet that was frustrating, wasn't it?  

A.61:  Oh, it was but,

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  the end result is after you put your, your panels on, nobody sees that
[laughter] you got one screw missing in your, your window regulator anyway
and,

B.64:  Right, right.  

A.65:  it, it runs.  It works just the same, so.

B.66:  Yeah, that's, that's true.  Well, you know, that, that is something I
really enjoy doing.  Um, working on our car too, the, uh, I just changed my
oil, oil tonight but, uh, I enjoy also working on things like the brakes and,
uh, in fact, just two weeks ago I helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his
car.  And, uh, either if it's a drum or, or disc brakes, I enjoy working on
those kind of things.

A.67:  Disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem but I, I honestly don't
have the tools for the drum.  I know you got, uh, certain spring lever that
you got to have or some, uh --

B.68:  Yeah.  Spoons and,

A.69:  -- some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back
over onto that notch.

B.70:  Yes, you do [laughter]. 

A.71:  Uh, my dad has got all that and, and I, I helped him when I was growing up,

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  but I don't have that stuff now, 

B.74:  Yeah.  

A.75:  because of the drum brakes I, you know, don't have any choice but to take
them in.

B.76:  Yeah, that's true.  And, you know, it, it doesn't, doesn't hurt every once
in a while to have them done professionally too because, um, I was helping my
neighbor out and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced and I don't have, of
course, the equipment to do that,

A.77:  Sure.  

B.78:  so he took it into a shop and had it resur-, uh, resurfaced and, and fixed
that way.  But, yeah, it is true, uh, you know, I did have a sixty-four Ford
truck that I wish I still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around
with it and work with it,

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  because you didn't have all the extra, extra stuff,

A.81:  [Laughter].  

B.82:  that's in there now.  

A.83:  I'll tell you what.  The other, the nicest thing about them is, uh,
everything was standard.  You didn't have to worry about finding a metric
anything.

B.84:  [Laughter]  Oh, yeah.  

A.85:  Boy, I tell you.

B.86:  And you know,
