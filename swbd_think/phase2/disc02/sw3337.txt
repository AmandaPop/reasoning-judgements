A.1:  Okay, uh, what, what is it, what does camping mean to you
and, and what camping have you done?

@B.2:  Oh, we've done a lot of camping, actually, that's one of our
favorite pastimes.

A.3:  Um.

B.4:  Um, to us, camping is, is a combination of tent camping as
well as environmental camping.  Uh, and I think that really what
it means to me is being outdoors in a sort of a wilderness
environment and being able to enjoy nature.  What does it mean to
you?

A.5:  Well, what, uh, what, what do you mean by environmental
camping?

B.6:  Um, there are a number of environmental cabins near where we
live that, uh, offer some sort of dwelling, some sort of, um,
security from the elements, but there's no electricity, no heat,
no water,

A.7:  Oh, okay.  But, yeah, that's neat, I've not, not, not had
that available anywhere that I've --

B.8:  Oh, yeah.

A.9:  -- lived at.  Well,

B.10:  State park system I think is probably what supports a lot of
those, they're state as opposed to county facilities.

A.11:  What, what state is that?

B.12:  California.

A.13:  California, okay.  I'm in Texas --

B.14:  Oh.

A.15:  -- and, uh, uh, but most of the camping that we've done, we
spent, uh, ten years in New England, and my wife and I --

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  -- did a lot of tent camping before, uh --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- our first, uh, boy was born, uh, there in the state parks
in, uh, New England.

B.20:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.21:  And, uh, here in Texas there are, there are state parks where
they have, uh, uh, shelters, they're called.  They're wood frame
on a concrete slab, screened in --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- kinds of, of shelters, and, but they have electricity and,
uh, water at those cabins --

B.24:  I see.

A.25:  -- (( )) cabins.

B.26:  Actually in the cabins, so it's like a, a --

A.27:  Well that's --

B.28:  -- a sink.

A.29:  -- the, no, the, there's uh, one outlet and a light in the
cabin, uh, an overhead, one overhead bulb, and then just outside
the cabin there's a, a faucet, coming up out of the, pipe coming
up out of the ground --

B.30:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.31:  -- so that there's access to water like that.  Uh,

B.32:  In, in Texas, what are the camp parks like?  If you go tent
camping, are you near a real wooded area, or does it tend to be
more, um --

A.33:  Well --

B.34:  -- plains.

A.35:  -- uh, no, it's, it's, the ones that I'm familiar with are,
are, uh, basically wooded areas, uh, Texas has an awful lot of, of
man made lakes --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and, uh, uh, tend to be, uh, wooded areas around those --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- lakes.  I'm in, I'm in Dallas, northeast --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- uh,

B.42:  What a difference from New England, though, I bet [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah, oh yes, yeah, yes.  There you, you could, you know,
depending on what kind of camping you wanted, why, uh, you go an
hour in a different direction.  Here you go three hours in any
direction and it's still about the same.  So [laughter] --

B.44:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.45:  -- uh, that's a difference, but we also,

B.46:  What was it like camping with your son when he was young?

A.47:  Well, well, we didn't, we took a break from camping, uh, for,
with the, the, uh, boys until they, uh, they got into scouts
basically, and, uh --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and our biggest one, we rented a pop-up tent trailer, uh,
several years ago and went up to, uh, the Black Hills and back
down through the -- 

B.50:  Oh, wow.

A.51:  -- uh, Colorado --

B.52:  That's a pretty area.

A.53:  -- Rocky Mountain National, uh, Park and --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- Colorado Springs area, and so forth --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- Pikes Peak.  And that was a, that was a lot of fun.

B.58:  I bet it was for them too.  

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  It's been an experience, uh, with our daughter who's turning
two in a couple of days.

A.61:  Oh, okay.

B.62:  Because she [noise] {television} was probably six months old
the first time, and we had kind of missed camping, the last time
we'd camped before she was born I think I was eight months
pregnant, because we like stretched to the very end [laughter] --

A.63:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.64:  -- and that was a little rough in a tent, but, uh, she's
actually done very well, and has enjoyed it a lot, even as a
little  --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- little kid, so it's been kind of fun, uh, trying to adjust
our routine and, and doing it with, with her as she grows up.

A.67:  Yeah,

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  I'm sure it'll be a lot different when she has a chance to
really participate more --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- which is like your kids have done.

A.73:  Right, at, at, at, at two she's old enough to walk but not
too far, I would guess, and,

B.74:  Right, and she's fairly cautious so we're not too --

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  -- concerned about her running into the poison ivy --

A.77:  Right.

B.78:  -- or whatever.

A.79:  Right, right.  But you also don't do a lot of hiking
associated with the camping --

B.80:  Exactly,

A.81:  -- I presume, yeah, yeah,

B.82:  Staying close to the camp,

A.83:  It sounds good, sounds good, and, uh,

B.84:  Well, it sounds like you've, um, continued it no matter where
you've been and how your family's grown.  So.

A.85:  Yeah, yeah,

B.86:  [Laughter]  That's my aspiration as well.

A.87:  [Laughter]  Uh, uh, and, uh, although it, it, after a while
it gets, with teenage boys at this point, well, one's in college,
but uh --

B.88:  Oh, wow.

A.89:  -- uh, uh, it, it turns different in that the, the problem
becomes one of getting, getting time when they're available and
don't have other activities, uh,

B.90:  Right, right,
