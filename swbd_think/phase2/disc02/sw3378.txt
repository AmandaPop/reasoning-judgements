==========================================================================

A.1:  All right, what's, what's the last thing you had done Berney?

B.2:  Oh, the last thing I had done or did, let's see.  Uh, [laughter] was
getting a, an old seventy-eight Jeep Cherokee ready to trade in.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  And, uh, so I was basically just going around and doing what I could do
fixing door locks and checking the transfer case fluid and things like that.
I'm kind of a motor head myself so this topic is [laughter] actually pretty
good for me.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Huh.

B.6:  Um, I've got a seventy Chevelle that I'm restoring too so it's, uh, there's
constant work going on,

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  to that car.  

A.9:  So you do a lot of, a lot of repairs for yourself?  

B.10:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.11:  Yeah.  I didn't, uh, used to do too many repairs but I got, we ended up
with a real old, uh, car that kind of needed constant repairs just to keep it
running.

B.12:  Sure.  

A.13:  And, uh, it got to be too expensive to take it in so I started, uh, I guess
the first thing I did was replace the star-, you know, I did sparkplugs and
things and,

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  and then I ha-, it needed a starter so I replaced that.  It needed a water
pump so I replaced that, and, uh, just about a week or two ago I had to pic-,
change an intact manifold gasket.

B.16:  Oh, wow.  

A.17:  Which was, which for me was, you know, I'd be, I'm, I'm forty.  I have
never done much auto repairs until about the last year or so,

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  so talking about taking the carburetor off and the,

B.20:  (( )) that's some, that's some serious work.

A.21:  Yeah, 

B.22:  Not only, uh, you have to have a,

A.23:  yeah.  It was, uh, it was,

B.24:  ((yeah, but)) you have to have a knowledge of quite a few of the, the
systems there to, to do that (( )).

A.25:  Yeah.  Well, I didn't have, I don't have much knowledge of the systems but
I just kind of know, you know, I, I make note of when I take a (( )) off and,
and, uh, [throat_clearing] so, you know, generally if you just kind of make,
make note of where everything goes as you are taking it off,

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  uh, you can,

B.28:  Have you tried any like the Chilton's, uh, manuals?  

A.29:  No.  Ho-, how are they?  

B.30:  Oh, I, I recommend them.  I've, uh, us-, I, uh, I have a Chilton's manual
in my Chevelle and every,

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  anytime I undertake anything ((that)), I start with that, that book.

A.33:  Well, does it tell you kind of a step-by-step, 

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  how-to type of thing?  

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  Oh, it does, huh?  

B.38:  Yeah.  They're, they're pretty good.  

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  Uh, the only problem I've noticed with them is that when I started working
on cars I, um, [lipsmack] uh, didn't really have much knowledge of them at all
and, and, you know, it's hard, the language of mo-, automotive mechanics is a
language all it's own.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  And just the names of some of the parts, 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  you know, they tell you to put the wrench on something and --

A.45:  Yeah, I have trouble with that trying to, 

B.46:  -- you know.  

A.47:  talk to people with parts shops now.

B.48:  Yeah, you know, and it took,

A.49:  [Throat_clearing].

B.50:  awhile before you figure out what everything is and, uh, and what you are
supposed to be doing with it, but I think it's a lot better than, than
starting from, starting cold,

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  and that's for sure.  

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  ((No)).  

A.55:  [Lipsmack] What kind of, uh, well, you pretty well do everything.

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  Yeah, I used to, uh, pay to have tune-ups done and, uh, oh, brake jobs and
things.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  And kind of had to do them [breathing] on this old car and, and, uh, I, I
don't think I'd ever pay to have someone put plugs and, and things in and then
the brake, changing brake pads was, that was easy.

B.60:  Oh, I know, 

A.61:  That was nothing, 

B.62:  brake job,

A.63:  that was nothing.  Th-, I, you know, I didn't have to bleed the lines down
or anything but it looked like if you were just, um, it looked like in most
cases you probably couldn't get air in those lines.

B.64:  Right.  

A.65:  Is that right?  

B.66:  Well, I, I don't know.  I've got, I've gotten the Chevelle, ((I've, did)),
done the brakes all the way around it myself,

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  and, uh,

A.69:  That was easy.  

B.70:  Well, this one has got drum brakes though.  

A.71:  Okay.  

B.72:  Drum bra-, drum brakes are a little bit tougher, 

A.73:  Tougher.  

B.74:  than disc brakes, 

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  but, uh, but still it's not anything that, that, you know, it's just a
matter of putting the parts in the right place,

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  and there isn't really anything you can do wrong to it.  

A.79:  Yeah.  

B.80:  Um, and those ones did have to have the lines bleed though.

A.81:  They did?  

B.82:  But, but bleeding the lines is just a matter of, uh, you know, just having
somebody on the, uh, pumping the ped-, the brake pedal for you.

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  And when it is,

A.85:  And you just open a, a valve of some sort until, until fluid comes out,

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  I guess and,

B.88:  Yeah, exactly.  

A.89:  Yeah.  Well, that, uh, the disc brakes, I mean that, you know, I, I used to
pay like sixty, seventy dollars to have that done.

B.90:  Sure.  

A.91:  I, I spent ten bucks on pads.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  And it took a couple hours.  

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  And they just, they just snap in basically.  I mean it was, it was, uh, it
was easy.

B.96:  Yeah, there's no, not, not too much trick for that.  

A.97:  Yeah.  

B.98:  Or, uh, ((buy)) I just, this new vehicle I ((buy)), just bought a
ninety-one G M C ((Sonomo)) which is a little pickup truck with a, and I'm
wondering when the time comes for the maintenance on this thing how much I'm
going to be able to do myself.

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  And how much is going to require all their diagnostics and, 

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  all that.  

A.103:  [Sniffing]. 

B.104:  It looks pretty simple.  I used to have an eighty-five Chrysler Laser and
this one certainly looks a lot more simple than, than that motor.

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  But, uh, I haven't, I haven't gotten into fuel injectors and things like
that,

A.107:  Yeah.   

B.108:  and everything is fuel injected so I don't know what the, uh, how that
will, will be.  The only thing I've ever done on a fuel injector is replace
the hose on it.  It was leaking, so.

A.109:  Huh.  

B.110:  [Laughter] I don't know.  I like the old cars.  You open up the hood on my
Chevelle and there's nothing under there but a big motor and, uh, [laughter]
you know, no,
