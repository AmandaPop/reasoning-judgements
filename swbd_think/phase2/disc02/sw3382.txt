============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I guess, uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and
stuff.  I've,

B.2:  Uh-huh.   

A.3:  read a lot of the,

B.4:  Uh-huh.   

A.5:  the, uh, astronomy books and,

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  and stuff like that.  Uh,

B.8:  Uh-huh.  Have you been following the, uh, the progress of the (( )) space
((health code))?

A.9:  Uh, to a degree.  I haven't kept up as, uh, much as I would like,

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  I've just been so busy, uh, 

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then, so. 

B.14:  Yeah.  I think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh, it would be
interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be
more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans and, uh, yeah, I think I would be
very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it
is at all possible.

A.15:  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one, 

B.16:  [Laughter]. 

A.17:  or right now but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.

B.18:  [Laughter] Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been
making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh,
abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.

A.19:  Right.  Yeah.  Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.  I think a lot
of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space
travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,

B.20:  Yeah, I agree.  Uh, as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to
Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there, and, uh,
one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- and, uh, that ((vacuum)), uh, little space program was one of the big,
you know, backers of that.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  It's amazing, you know, you, it's hard to imagine what life was like
without it now.

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  I don't know if you ever watch ((Gallagher)), you know, he's one of the
comedians and --

B.28:  Uh-huh, yeah, I've h-, seen him before.  

A.29:  -- and, you know, he, he talks a lot on, on Velcro.  

B.30:  [Laughter].  

A.31:  Wh-, i-, what would we do without it?  [laughter].

B.32:  Yeah.  Yo-, we were talking about that just the other day.  What did we do
without it back then?

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.

A.35:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  Yeah, there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come
((up)).  I know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh, concentrated foods
for one maybe [laughter] I don-,

B.38:  [Laughter] That's right.  That's right.

A.39:  Uh, I don't know it's also just I've, I've often pictured, uh, in my mind,
you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept
on going, kept on going?

B.40:  Uh-huh.  That's true.  

A.41:  Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it?  Uh, finite --

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object,

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  and it's hard to, to see, you know. 

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.

B.50:  Yeah, that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think
about.  I agree.  You know like you say we're used to finite things and
something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.

A.51:  Yeah.  But,

B.52:  But, uh, yeah, I would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make
space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, en-, enjoy.

A.53:  Yeah.  I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do
something.

B.54:  ((Uh-huh.))  

A.55:  And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you
know, 

B.56:  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  I wouldn't even mind being [laughter] not so much
being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out
and explore something they haven't,

A.59:  Huh.  

B.60:  or experience something, you know, indifferent.  

A.61:  I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our
curiosity.

B.62:  Oh, sure.  Sure.  Of course.  That's true.  

A.63:  There must be some better so-, better way of doing this.  A better place to
be or whatever, you know it's,

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  So you, you are always looking for something better.  

B.66:  Yeah, that's true.  

A.67:  I know at work, uh, people always complain to me I, well, you are always
whining and,

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  it's, I'm always looking for something better.  Uh,

B.70:  Yeah [laughter]. 

A.71:  There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.  

B.72:  That's right.  That's right.  And if you are just content with being, you
know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a
pretty dull life.

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  [Laughter]  Because if yo-,

A.75:  Well, they are always finding easier ways and, you know, just because they
don't talk about it or something like that.

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  And they are doing it un-, you know, unconsciously.  

B.78:  Yeah, I guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much.  I guess you
are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff but yo-, it, it's
in a subconscious, you know, thing.  You know, somewhere they can sit down and
write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon, you probably
wouldn't have a pretty good list.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  But you just don't think about them.  

A.81:  Right.  

B.82:  [Lipsmack] And that's true.  I think, uh, you know, we've gotten different
programs at work, you know, to, to, uh, make it visible to management that we
are doing things better,
