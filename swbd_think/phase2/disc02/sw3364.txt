B.1:  What's your favorite T V show?

@A.2:  Oh.  You know, I used to like ST. ELSEWHERE.

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  That's one of my old favorites.  Um, and that's, I'm being
beeped, so I'll just ignore it.  Um, and now, I, I did like
THIRTY SOMETHING --

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  -- oh, yes, my daughter says NINE OH TWO ONE OH.  We like
that one.

B.7:  Yeah, that's one of my favorites.

A.8:  Good, and how old are you?

B.9:  I'm twenty-eight.

A.10:  Oh, so you're little bit younger than I am, but yeah, I think
if my seventeen year old, my fourteen year old, my other two
children like it, I'm over forty, and I like it.  I think it's
wonderful.

B.11:  Yeah, it's a good show.  I like MURPHY BROWN and DESIGNING
WOMEN, too.

A.12:  [Laughter]  Oh, yeah, now see, I, we are so busy with, all of
our kids are in sports, and I hardly ever watch T V, but that's
one that, that we watch.  And then Sunday nights we watch, uh,
LIFE GOES ON.

B.13:  Yeah, I like that, that's, that's a good show, too.

A.14:  Very good.  Did you see the one on Sunday?

B.15:  Yes, it was a, uh, uh I did miss that Sunday, no I didn't.

A.16:  That one kid that Becca likes --

B.17:  Yeah, it's a good episode.

A.18:  -- he has AIDS.

B.19:  Yeah, the, the new character on there did.

A.20:  Right, right.  All the way to North Carolina.  What time is
it there?

B.21:  Uh, it is twenty minutes to nine.

A.22:  Oh, my gosh.  See, I'm twenty minutes to six here [laughter].  

B.23:  Three hours difference.

A.24:  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What else do you like?

B.25:  Uh, let's see, I like a lot of different shows.  Let's see,
um, I like MURDER, SHE WROTE.  That's, that's,

A.26:  Oh, I never, I never watched that ever in my entire life.  

B.27:  And MATLOCK is another good one I watch.

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  Um, then during daytimes I like, I like ALL MY CHILDREN. 

A.30:  A small bowl will be plenty.  Oh, that's mine.  That's the
only one I watch whenever I, oh, a small bowl will be better
[talking] because it's pretty fattening.  Talk to my daughter. 
Um, um,

B.31:  ALL MY CHILDREN, I've watched that for about twelve years.

A.32:  Yeah, I've, I'm sure I watched it for more than that
probably.  Twenty something.  I used to watch GENERAL HOSPITAL
when I was a teenager because I,

B.33:  I quit watching GENERAL HOSPITAL when Leslie got killed.

A.34:  Oh.

B.35:  So that was a long time ago.  I used to watch it, was in high
school and college --

A.36:  Right.

B.37:  -- when Laura's mother got killed.  She was my favorite
character on there.

A.38:  [Laughter].

B.39:  I just, I read the reason she got, they, they killed her off
was because they couldn't settle a contract, and I said, well, if
they're going to do that to her, I won't watch it.

A.40:  [Laughter] Oh, that's great.  Well, I do like ALL MY
CHILDREN, and I, and I like it, you know, I don't know.  I just,
I like the people on it, I guess, you know.

B.41:  I, I, I like it.  I just wish they'd bring some of the old
characters back. 

A.42:  Yeah, well, Tad's going to come back, I bet, do you think?

B.43:  Yeah, I'm sure he will.

A.44:  He'll come back, show up at just the right moment.  

B.45:  I kind of wish that, uh, Nina would come back because she --

A.46:  Oh.

B.47:  -- because the story, you know, just for a brief visit or
whatever, because it never has been resolved with Palmer
remarrying, and everything,

A.48:  Yeah, like Daisy, pops in once in a while, and, I forgot
about Nina and Cliff, right.  

B.49:  Yeah, Cliff's on THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS now.  

A.50:  Oh, he is.  So he's out for good.  

B.51:  Yeah, he's out for good.  

A.52:  Did they marry?

B.53:  Uh --

A.54:  Nina and Cliff?

B.55:  -- that's how they left the show, but not in real life.

A.56:  Um.

B.57:  Now she's married to some guy in New York, and she's happily
married and that's the reason she left the show.  I guess she
wanted a private life.

A.58:  Oh, okay, oh, see I, I, I watch it maybe twice a month, so, I
don't watch it everyday like I did when I had babies.

B.59:  Oh, well, I, I watch.

A.60:  Because I play lots of tennis and I'm gone a lot, so, I don't
get to watch,

B.61:  I watch it everyday, religiously.  I videotape it when I have
to miss it.

A.62:  Oh, no kidding.  

B.63:  Yeah.

A.64:  I use to be, I used to be like that [laughter].

B.65:  I'm that way about a lot of different shows.  I'm that way
about MURPHY BROWN, DESIGNING WOMEN.

A.66:  Now isn't DESIGNING WOMEN, don't they have a new chick on
there instead of the, instead of what's her name?

B.67:  Uh, yeah, there's two new characters on there.  There's, um,
uh, Jan Hooks from SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE.  I don't know if you know
her or not.

A.68:  Huh-uh.  That's a show I like.

B.69:  And then, and then, uh, [lipsmack], uh, the blond headed
girl that used to be on NEWHART.

A.70:  Oh, yeah, oh.  

B.71:  I don't like her on it, I never have liked her, so.

A.72:  Well, I, I just know which one she is.  I don't, you know.

B.73:  She's taken the Suzanne's part, and then Jan Hooks has taken
Charlene's part.

A.74:  Charlene was Delta Burke?

B.75:  Charlene was Jean Smart, the blond headed.

A.76:  Oh, okay, well, see, I never watch that one either.  I really
don't watch a whole lot of T V, just, you know, on Sunday nights,
LIFE GOES ON comes on about the time that we eat dinner, and my
whole family's home, because I don't allow the kids out on Sunday
night --

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  -- you know, because they've got to go to bed and go to
school the next day, and so we, we sit around and eat popcorn
and, oh, then we watch AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS.  Those are
always pretty cute.

B.79:  Well, MURDER, SHE WROTE comes on opposite of that, and so,

A.80:  Oh, so you don't watch that one --

B.81:  Yeah I --

A.82:  -- instead of,

B.83:  -- I pick nights pretty much so on T V that I watch different
networks, but --

A.84:  Sure.

B.85:  -- BEVERLY HILLS NINE OH TWO ONE OH, I, I watch it
religiously.

A.86:  Yeah, we like that real well.

B.87:  It, be sure to watch it tomorrow night --

A.88:  Uh-huh.

B.89:  -- because somebody's getting killed on it.

A.90:  I know.  The kids already know who it is, I don't know who it
is, though,

B.91:  Who is it?  Ask them [laughter].

A.92:  Let me ask Nicole.  {Speaking to someone in room} Nicole.
