B.1:   Go ahead.  

@A.2:   Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.  I'm, uh, that,
that's a whole, pleased with the pr-, practice that is they, I, uh,
I don't, ((you would favor)) invasions of privacy on the other hand
that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical
to public safety should have to meet special standards.  Uh, I
haven't given this matter enough thought.  

B.3:   Do you work for T I?  

A.4:   No, #uh,# 

B.5:   #Oh.#

A.6:   I'm in the Washington area.  I work for ((N I S T)).

B.7:   Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  Well, see we have the testing
already here.  We've had it for, oh, about five years.  

A.8:   Uh-huh.

B.9:   It used to just be for new employees.  #And now# --

A.10:   #And now,#

B.11:   -- it's for all employees.  They, uh, randomly select employee
numbers and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to
go and, and be tested.

A.12:   #Okay, and how do people feel about it?#

B.13:   #So, we're familiar with it.#  Oh, we have a lot of, um,
people upset about it at the beginning.  Some not all.  But what
was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the
company there was a lot of drug abuse.  Um, [breathing] mainly the
areas whe-, where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type
things and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a
little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening, and
we had people using on the premises and actually selling and
dealing, you know, on the premises.  

A.14:   Well, okay, that's, that's a very different issue.  

B.15:   [Laughter] Well, yeah, it was, you know, combination of, of,
uh, both activities and, uh, and using too so they developed this,
uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate, there's some parts of
the company that we do, uh, government contracts, and I think some
of those require the drug testing, but now T I thought well, we'll
just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety
issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for
all people to work in and that we shouldn't have, um, people on
drugs within our, you know, offices and such.  

A.16:   #And,# 

B.17:   #I haven't# personally ever been tested, but I don't have a
problem with it.  

A.18:   Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs? 

B.19:   No, but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching
it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking
somebody else's prescription drug.  You know, it happens a lot of
times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and,
you know -- 

A.20:   #((Well)),#

B.21:   -- #then# they give it to everybody else in the family and don't
always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another
prescription.  Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take
a prescription drug it has to be in your name.  It, you know, it
can't be in your spouse's name so they will look, I mean, the
testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs, and you have to
tell them what they are taking a prescription for.  

A.22:   So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs
you are taking?  

B.23:   Right.  Yes, yes.  When you get tested you are supposed to
tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.  And
then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to
show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.  

A.24:   Okay.  Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they
don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many
prescription drugs but that I, but they ((don't say in advance)),
uh, #so,# 

B.25:   #Well,# what they wo-, be testing for are the ones that would
have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in
them.  

A.26:   The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances
or #something ((anyway)).#

B.27:   #Right, right.#  I guess that's what i-, they wouldn't be
looking for penicillin and an-, antibiotics and stuff.  They would
be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates
#amphetamines.# 

A.28:   #So what they are# asking you to tell them is all the
prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances. 

B.29:   Right, right.  You pretty much, you know, put down what you
remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.  But
afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled #substance [laughter].#

A.30:   #Is Contact a,#

B.31:   Well, #[laughter],#

A.32:   #Bo-,#

B.33:   you, you probably put down, you know, you had ((Drixoral)) or
Contact if you would remember that you did it.  

A.34:   Okay. Is Contact a, 

B.35:   No.

A.36:   #(( )) substance?# 

B.37:   #[Laughter] I'm,#

A.38:   Okay.

B.39:   just saying you probably pro-, put down on the sheet --

A.40:   #Okay.#

B.41:   -- #anything# you have taken.  But if they had a controlled
substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that
prescription in your name.  I know I had one contract employee
through Manpower was not a T I person,

A.42:   Uh-huh.

B.43:   but was a contract person, and they test them too even if you
are not a real, uh, T I -er.  If you are a contract employee here --

A.44:   #Uh-huh.#

B.45:   -- #they test# you too.  And he had taken some kind of, um,
[lipsmack] oh, you know, uh, just, he had some kind of flu or
something.  He got a real bad migraine and he took his mother's,
