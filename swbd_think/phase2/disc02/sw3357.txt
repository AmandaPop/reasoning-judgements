REMARKS:        Apparently the phone was accidentally disconnected. The 
last speaking as shown, of both B and A, comes from the monologues.  It 
does not match exactly what seemed to happen during the dialogue.  Also, 
the last speaking of B seemed to be in A's voice, but was in B's 
monologue, so that is where I put it.

==========================================================================

A.1:  I guess we get started now?

B.2:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

A.3:  I don't know, I, you know, I've always was interested in, in woodworking.
I watch a lot of the P B S stations where they have, uh, you know, the
woodworking --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- uh, shows and that, but I've never really done anything myself, because
I don't really have the tools for it --

B.6:  Is that right.

A.7:  -- but, uh, someday, when I can get up, uh, enough of the tools, I, I want
to try and make a lot of the stuff.  I got books on it and everything that
shows you step by step on how to do it --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- but, uh,

B.10:  Yeah, I've never made, made much myself.  I guess, uh, do they count, uh,
uh, let's see, I guess tree houses and things like that don't count as wood-,
woodworking, do they.

A.11:  Oh, well I think anything from, you know, building a house, uh, to
cabinetry would be woodworking.  I mean, I, I think that would be --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- classified that.  You built a tree house.  Pretty good.

B.14:  Oh, yeah, you know, hold on a second.  You can't pull up, hold on, you
can't pull up on it, it'll disconnect.  Um, yeah, I've done tree houses and
crafts, you know, craft type of things, you know, out of plywood --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- [Cough] things of that.  So I have a, a few saws, I mean a few, a few
tools --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- that you need for that kind of stuff.  Just not a, not like for book
shelves, well, I can make book shelves, too, I guess.  Nothing like for
cabinets or tables or things like that.  You know, you have to have special,
some special things for that --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- well, but, [sniffing] I mean, I do household repairs.  I guess that
counts as woodworking doesn't it.

A.21:  Yeah --

B.22:  Yeah, uh,

A.23:  -- I think so.  You get skills in that, uh, that helps you in almost
anything you do, so --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- yeah that's fine.  Yeah, I wanted a, maybe I might try and, uh, even
though I don't have too much tools, but I don't think it takes too much to
build a book shelf.  I know I, I need one, so, maybe.

B.26:  No, it doesn't take too much for that.  My dad does a lot of woodworking, I
mean, he makes like furniture [laughter].

A.27:  Yeah, well, it sounds like both our dads are good.  My dad made a, a whole
wall cabinet, uh, closet type thing, and all he did was, he hired someone once
to build it, and then he watched them, and he, uh, built it himself, and he
did,

B.28:  Yeah, now what did he make?  A cabinet?

A.29:  Yeah, it's kind of a, a, a closet cabinet, uh, built on a whole wall --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- took up the whole wall, and it's got, uh, the, for hanging up shirts and
pants area, and drawers, and all sorts of things in there.  It's pretty (( )).

B.32:  Uh-huh.  Takes up the whole wall?

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Huh.

A.35:  Pretty fancy.

B.36:  Yeah.  I've always wanted to make furniture and stuff but [throat_clearing]
the, uh, the tools and, uh, you know, I have to watch my dad do it.  But the
tools have gotten me, and, uh, [throat_clearing] seems like it's very
time-consuming.  I've never, never with all my kids, I've never had much time
for that, for the time-consuming things.

A.37:  Yeah, yeah, I know, uh --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- I know, watching these programs with some of the fancy tools they have,
that it makes it so easy that I think almost anyone could do it if they could
afford the probably four or five thousand dollars for each item they got.

B.40:  [Laughter].

A.41:  Uh, it, just about everything it does, uh, you know, different things for,
for different cuts and that and --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- uh, I think it would make it so much easier, but --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- I think that would be more for the professional, if you're going to do
it as a business those types of tools are fine.

B.46:  Yeah.  Well my dad doesn't do it as a business, and he's, and he's got
thousands of dollars worth of [beep] {pause},

A.47:  Yeah, yeah, are we, 

B.48:  We got disconnected.  We talked for a pretty good while.

A.49:  Are we,

B.50:  It was here, it was on this end.  

A.51:  I'm still here.  Hello.  [noise] [child_talking] Hello.  {Talking to
someone in the background}.  Hey, what happened?  What do they do when you're
done?  Do they just disconnect you?  [Voice] {woman telling him what happens
when time runs out}.  Well, I just got disconnected.  [Talking] {woman
speaking to A} I think his, he's got a kid there [clicking] [ringing].
