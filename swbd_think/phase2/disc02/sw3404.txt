A.1:  Hi, my name is Donna Donahue.

B.2:  Donna.

A.3:  Yes.

B.4:  Hi, I'm Lynn Randall.

A.5:  Okay, I have a cold this morning, so you have to excuse my, my sound here.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  Um, I'm from, uh, Plano, Texas.  Where are you from?

B.8:  Plano, Texas [laughter].

A.9:  Oh, okay, that's nice and easy.

B.10:  Yes.

A.11:  Um, let's see, would you like to, to start --

B.12:  Sure,

A.13:  -- or would you, okay.

B.14:  That'd be just fine, we might as well go ahead.

A.15:  Okay.  Um, did you want me to start?

B.16:  Yeah, you have to.  

A.17:  Oh, I'm sorry.

B.18:  You have to push the button.

A.19:  Oh, I have to start.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Okay.

B.22:  Push one.

A.23:  Well, um, my, oh I did.

B.24:  Did you yet push the button?

A.25:  I did push one.

B.26:  Oh, okay, okay.

A.27:  Shall I push it again, you think?

B.28:  No, no, that's, that's it.

A.29:  No, okay.  Um, my, um, I love to cross stitch, and my husband and my son,
who is now eleven watch so much sports on T V --

@B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- that lately I have been just in a cross stitch frenzy --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- because I cannot stand being in the same room with the T V on with all
the sports, so, so much that I have to si-, I can sit there as long as I'm
cross stitching and while I'm doing that, so that that's one of my, my favorite
hobbies, that I, that I like to.  What, what about you?

B.34:  Well, I do cross stitch also.

A.35:  Okay.

B.36:  In fact I was just sitting here getting ready to start some things.

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  So, um, I've done it for a number of years, and, uh, so that is one of my
favorite things to do also.  I find it very relaxing.

A.39:  I do too.  I.

B.40:  And, and, so like if I, um, you know, if I haven't done it for a while I
like to have a, I just like to have a project going, um --

A.41:  Yes.

B.42:  -- because I think it, it's, it's just a real good thing --

A.43:  It is.

B.44:  -- to have.

A.45:  I, I enjoy it too, and I have found a wonderful framer on Fifteenth Street
down in Old Plano, about two doors down from, uh, Nooks and Crannies --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- um, who, who does, he's really an artist, and he does a wonderful,
wonderful job with, I just give him my things, and he triple mats everything
--

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and he has really nice frames.  And I think when you, it's very
satisfying after you do something like that to have it framed and hang it up.
Um, it, it's always, that's kind of the fun part.

B.50:  Now do you think he's reasonable, in terms of prices?

A.51:  Very reasonable.  I have brought something to Michaels, and I was very
disappointed in it, and it was just a small little picture for my daughter's
room.  In fact there were two little cross stitches I did for her room --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and, um, apparently two people framed them differently, they, two people
took, instead of one person doing, doing the framing --

B.54:  Ri-, uh.

A.55:  -- two people did it because the mats were just different sizes and to put
them next to each other, it just didn't look right --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and, um, he is so reasonable that, um, and he has all these unusual
frames that he uses.  His name is, um, I guess I can just tell you his name --

B.58:  Sure.

A.59:  -- it's Matte ink and it's, um, I think the address is ten eleven and a
half on Fifteenth, because it's a skinny little door next to I think Bows and,

B.60:  So, is it, is it, so,

A.61:  It's upstairs and this little skinny door, it's right on Fifteenth Street,
right down --

B.62:  Well I'm glad to know that.

A.63:  -- right down by the railroad tracks.  His name is Dan.

B.64:  Okay, so it's closer to the railroad tracks then --

A.65:  Yes closer to the,

B.66:  -- from Nooks and Crannies,

A.67:  Right down --

B.68:  Okay,

A.69:  -- down from Nooks and Crannies --

B.70:  Okay.

A.71:  -- and it's Matte, M A T T E, Inc, I N C period --

B.72:  Okay.

A.73:  -- and, um, he does such a beautiful job, I'll take something in, I do
simple cross stitches, mostly, samplers, and a few that are a little bit more
complicated but I don't really, um, with three kids running around it's, it's
hard for me to get something too intricate --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- so I like something that's kind of quick and, and I love, I like doing
the samplers, I have a whole wall of them, and he'll just take this sampler
which is just, you know, mediocre, not so great, and when he puts the colors
he picks out --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- little bits of, um, colors that he'll pick from your, from your work
and, and matte it with that little color, and it just, it just makes this
wonderful piece of art.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  Um, so I'm real, real happy with them, and they have some really nice books
down there.  Have you seen the books in the small shops in, um --

B.80:  Oh, yes.

A.81:  -- on Fifteenth Street --

B.82:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.83:  -- you know, I'm fairly new to the area so, I'm always glad to find a nice
little shop that has different books.  But, uh.

B.84:  I basically, I basically buy most of my things there in Nooks and Crannies
--

A.85:  Do you --

B.86:  -- at that --

A.87:  -- uh-huh.

B.88:  -- at that store.  Um, there used to be a wonderful store on Fifteenth but
it closed.

A.89:  Oh.

B.90:  And she had fabulous things but it's been closed a couple of years.  So,
really, in my, now I didn't, I, in fact I was just there yesterday but I
didn't go across the street.  I saw that there's a place across the street I
didn't go in --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- to that place but I generally buy most of my things in Nooks and
Crannies.

A.93:  Do you?

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  Um, now I really usually don't get the real expensive linens to work on,
which, uh, maybe that's what you do, it's probably really, really beautiful to
do that.  But I, I just get the regular piece of cloth --

B.96:  Yeah.

A.97:  -- you know, and do it on that --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- but, um, 

B.100:  Well, it depends on what I'm doing.  I turn to, um, see I make up most of
my own things --

A.101:  Oh, okay.

B.102:  -- and, and, so, um, in fact, I make up almost everything I do now.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  I used to do, uh, you know, kits and all, or I'd use books --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- but I, I tend not to do that much anymore.  Um, so it depends on what
I'm doing as to what I use.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  I recently did one on linen and that's the first time,
