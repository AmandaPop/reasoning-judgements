another call trying to ring through on call waiting. 

========================================================================

A.1:  Now we're ready.  Do you have a personal computer?   

@B.2:  We have one.   

A.3:  You do, in your home?

B.4:  Yes, yes, ma'am.   

A.5:  I do not have one in my home.  I use one all day at work, but I don't have
one at home.

B.6:  Do you wish you,  

A.7:  Do you find you use it a lot?   

B.8:  I don't use it as much as my children and my husband do.  My, actually my
husband and I are taking a class at our local junior college called micro,
micro computers one o one and we're just touching on data base, spreadsheets
and word processing and just kind of, you know, different kinds of [noise]
storage and we're just kind of touching on a basic --

A.9:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.   

B.10:  -- computer.   

A.11:  What kind do you have?   

B.12:  We have an I B M compatible.  It's a Gateway brand --   

A.13:  Uh-huh.    

B.14:  -- that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  Well, that sounds interesting.   

B.16:  Yeah.  What kind of a computer do you use at work?   

A.17:  I have a, a P S one I B M type.   

B.18:  Uh-huh.   

A.19:  Uh, and I use it all day at work and I put all my personal stuff on it at
work [laughter].

B.20:  Uh-huh.   

A.21:  So I really don't, haven't had a need for one at home but probably if I
didn't have access to one all the time at work, I'd want one at home.

B.22:  Right.  I worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four
years.

A.23:  Uh-huh.   

B.24:  Which was different [laughter].   

A.25:  Yeah.   

B.26:  But I didn't,   

A.27:  What is that tracing, tracking the flights and things?   

B.28:  Right, right.   

A.29:  Uh.   

B.30:  How long are we supposed to talk on this?   

A.31:  They tell us when we're through.   

B.32:  Oh, okay, okay.  This is,   

A.33:  They come in and tell us.  Have you just started doing this? 

B.34:  This is my very first time.   

A.35:  Oh really?  

B.36:  Yes. 

A.37:  They'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it's time
for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that.

B.38:  Oh, okay.   

A.39:  It's not more than five min-, [clicking],   

B.40:  Uh-oh.   

A.41:  But, I'm going to ignore that.  That's a call on my other line, so --

B.42:  Oh, okay.   

A.43:  -- I'm just going to ignore it.  But,   

B.44:  Oh, okay.  That, I have that, too.   

A.45:  [Laughter] It's kind of a hassle when you have this, but other times
[clicking] it.

B.46:  W-, where do you work?   

A.47:  I work at Texas Instruments.   

B.48:  Oh, you do?   

A.49:  Yes.   

B.50:  Oh, well, of course.   

A.51:  I sure do.   

B.52:  Of course.  That's why you [laughter], why you're making these calls,
right?

A.53:  Well, no, I'm doing this at home.  I'm already home for the day.

B.54:  Oh, I see.  Well, this is a pretty good deal.  

A.55:  I [clicking] do it, you know, I can't do it at work.  I, I'm, I work in the
legal department so I'm pretty busy.

B.56:  Uh-huh.   

A.57:  But I use my P C there mostly for creating legal documents.  We use Word
Perfect, Lotus.

B.58:  Uh-huh.   

A.59:  Uh,   

B.60:  Oh, you do know Lotus, huh?  Oh, that's great.  That's something we want to
learn.

A.61:  Yeah, it's really, I love Lotus.   

B.62:  Oh. 

A.63:  I think that's about my favorite.   

B.64:  I've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it.

A.65:  Uh-huh.   

B.66:  That's great.   

A.67:  It really is, and I know there's still a hundred things I don't know how to
do on it.

B.68:  Uh-huh.   

A.69:  But, uh, you know, you learn something every time you use it. 

B.70:  I have a question.  On this, this thing that I'm, this survey or whatever,
you know, this --

A.71:  Uh-huh.   

B.72:  -- I volunteered for.  Do I start calling in myself or do I wait for people
to call me?

A.73:  You can, did they give you a number to call?   

B.74:  Right, and eight hundred number.   

A.75:  You can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you but you can only
make one call a day.

B.76:  Oh, only one a day.   

A.77:  Yeah, if you've talked to someone, like you're talking to me now --

B.78:  Right.   

A.79:  -- and I place the call, this counts as your call.   

B.80:  Oh,  

A.81:  So you cannot make a call now until tomorrow.   

B.82:  Oh, I see.  Okay, so then, do you get the five bucks or do I? 

A.83:  No, we both do.   

B.84:  Oh, we both do.  Well that's --  

A.85:  Didn't they --  

B.86:  -- a,    

A.87:  -- ask you for your I D number when you answered?   

B.88:  Right, I had to put that in.   

A.89:  Okay so you both do.   

B.90:  Well, that's a pretty good deal.   

A.91:  From what I understand.   

B.92:  So why, why are we doing this?   

A.93:  It's for research.   

B.94:  Actually, I'm doing this for somebody else but, you know, for a friend of
mine.

A.95:  It's a research type project on -- 

B.96:  Uh-huh. 

A.97:  -- uh, voice activated electronics, you know.   

B.98:  Oh.  

A.99:  To, uh, it's, uh -- 

B.100:  It's almost like that,  

A.101:  -- well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up.

B.102:  Like a voice command --  

A.103:  Uh-huh.   

B.104:  -- computer type --  

A.105:  Uh-huh.   

B.106:  -- thing, oh.   

A.107:  They're doing research for a lot of big companies from what I understand on
this.  Now I don't know,

B.108:  Well, that's wonderful.   

A.109:  I don't know everything about it but they, uh, try to get as many people
as they possibly can to contribute to this and that way they can check voice
patterns.

B.110:  I see, different kinds of voices and things.   

A.111:  Uh-huh, and get the computer where it recognizes voices.   

B.112:  Wonderful.  See that's why I, it's interesting because you have I, I'm
going to say you have an accent [laughter].

A.113:  Well, I probably do because I've,    

B.114:  And I, and I think that I don't.  I mean to you but,   

A.115:  [Laughter].  

B.116:  you know.   

A.117:  Well, I've been b-, I was born and raised in Texas.  Have lived here
forever so I probably do.

B.118:  And you're in what city?   

A.119:  I'm in Richardson.  It's right outside of Dallas.   

B.120:  Okay, my sister, one of my sisters lives in Plano.   

A.121:  Uh-huh.   

B.122:  And that's right outside of,    

A.123:  Well, Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano.   

B.124:  How about that.  I probably went through Richardson, then.  

A.125:  You probably did.   

B.126:  And then I have a sister that lives in Austin.   

A.127:  Uh-huh.   

B.128:  But,   

A.129:  Well, what are you doing way in Washington?   

B.130:  Well, we're actually all from Nebraska.  They just are recently moved
there.  My brother-in-law is director of Admissions at the University of Texas
--

A.131:  Uh-huh.   

B.132:  -- in Dallas.   

A.133:  Well, that's interesting.   

B.134:  Yeah, and then my sister works at the Air Force Base.   

A.135:  Uh-huh.  So I imagine they use personal computers.   

B.136:  Actually, yes, they both have personal computers.   

A.137:  Do they do their correspondence on it?   

B.138:  Uh, I think they just send Christmas letters on it.   

A.139:  Uh-huh.   

B.140:  As far as I, mostly my one sister uses hers for her children. 

A.141:  Uh-huh.   

B.142:  You know, children's games.
