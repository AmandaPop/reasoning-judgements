A.1:   So, who's your favorite team?  

B.2:   My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.  

A.3:   Pittsburgh?   

B.4:   #You bet.# 

A.5:   #I used# to be a big Pittsburgh fan when I was little.  

B.6:   Well, I, uh, when ((John)) ((Stallworth)) played he was from my
hometown in Alabama, 

A.7:   #Oh, really?# 

B.8:   #so I# kind of grabbed on to that team,

A.9:   Huh.  #((That's pretty nice)).# 

B.10:   #way back when.#  

A.11:   ((Yeah,)) that's good.  I, I used to watch them a lot when
they were playing the big iron curtain, 

B.12:   #That's right.# 

A.13:   #or steel curtain.# 

B.14:   How about your favorite team?  

A.15:   Huh.  Well, last year it was Buffalo and I, I still try to
keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as
being so efficient and they never score.  They never blow out their
opponents.  They just score just enough points, 

B.16:   #Uh-huh.# 

A.17:   #and that really# impressed me.  But then down here I li-, 
(( )) is pretty close to New Orleans and I've been keeping up with
the Saints a lot.  

B.18:   Well, they are exciting, aren't they?  

A.19:   Yeah, the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you
know, a lot.  

B.20:   Boy, they are, they are just a fun team to watch.   

A.21:   This, it, they are really.  Did you see the game Sunday night
or, 

B.22:   #Uh,#  

A.23:   #Sunday# afternoon?  

B.24:   no, I didn't.  

A.25:   It was funny.  There were, they ha-, uh, a fireworks display
at halftime.  

B.26:   [Laughter] Oh, yeah?  

A.27:   Yeah, and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the
roof caught [laughter] on fire.  

B.28:   Oh, #you're kidding [laughter].#

A.29:   #So, they had# to stop the game ((in lieu of)) the third
quarter -- 

B.30:   [Laughter] Oh, my gos-, 

A.31:   -- and put out this fire.  Those big piece of something came
flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field so there's
this big fire on the field and they were dumping the ((Gatorade))
bucket and everything.  

B.32:   Oh, I can't #believe that.# 

A.33:   #It was funn-, I mean,# you just really can't tell what's
going to happen.  

B.34:   That's hilarious.  

A.35:   I know.  It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the
Saints.  

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   And ((Morton)) Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal.  

B.38:   Oh.  

A.39:   And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle.  

B.40:   Oh, boy.  He is tough, he has -- 

A.41:   He is.  

B.42:   -- an incredible leg.   

A.43:   Yes.  

B.44:   Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make
it this year,

A.45:   #Uh I s-,#

B.46:   #past the first# playoff game?  

A.47:   I sure hope so.  I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play. 
Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.  

B.48:   Who's that?  

A.49:   It's pretty much going between Washington.  They are
undefeated.  

B.50:   Right.  

A.51:   And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has
only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo.  And they beat the
Saints.  Their only time they lost.  

B.52:   What do you think about, uh, Houston?  

A.53:   Houston.  I saw Houston play this summer in Memphis.  

B.54:   Oh, yeah?  

A.55:   Yeah.  Uh, from what I saw they were playing, when I was at
the game we sat right on the front row,

B.56:   #Huh.# 

A.57:   #right# behind the Houston Oilers, and from what I saw the
game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot.  

B.58:   #Huh.# 

A.59:   #But my# brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon
was just having an off night, and if that was an off night I'd hate
to see when he's on a good night.  

B.60:   Oh, yeah, he's -- 

A.61:   He's,

B.62:   -- he definitely, uh, is one of the best I think.  

A.63:   Yeah, the, their, their backfield is really impressive. 
Haywood ((Jeffreys)) and Drew Hill -- 

B.64:   Right.  

A.65:   -- and ((Allen)) (( )), they really impress me.  

B.66:   Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday.  

A.67:   That's right.  Who, who did they play?  

B.68:   They played Dallas.  

A.69:   Dallas, that's right,

B.70:   #They won,# 

A.71:   #all because,#  

B.72:   in overtime.  

A.73:   That's right.  I remember that now.  

B.74:   So that was, I, I watched that game and, uh, that was, uh,

A.75:   Do you have a favorite between those two?  

B.76:   Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, I kind of pull for
Dallas.  

A.77:   Really?  [Laughter]. 

B.78:   Yeah.  Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division so,

A.79:   #Well, that's true.# 

B.80:   #I'll almost always# root against them.  

A.81:   [Laughter] (( )).

B.82:   [Laughter]. 

A.83:   I hate to say it but I hate Dallas [laughter]. 

B.84:   That's okay [laughter].  Well I, you know, I, I was never
really a big Dallas fan -- 

A.85:   Yeah.  

B.86:   -- until we moved here and they just kind of grew on me.  

A.87:   Yeah, I imagine.  That's the way, I've never been a big Saints
fan until the last year or two and they, they've actually started
doing something.  

B.88:   Yeah.  Yeah.

A.89:   So, I've actually pl-, paid attention to them.  

B.90:   [Laughter] Well [breathing],

A.91:   Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're
thinking about bringing in?  

B.92:   To tell you the truth I haven't paid too much attention to
that.  

A.93:   Really?  

B.94:   Um, what cities are they looking at?  

A.95:   Uh, right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to
get the #teams.# 

B.96:   #Uh-huh.# 

A.97:   And that's, that's where I was when I saw, uh,

B.98:   #Uh-huh.#  

A.99:   #Houston# play.  St. Louis is trying to get a team.  Uh,
Baltimore is trying to get a team, and there's some other city. 
I'm wanting to say Raleigh ((Durham)) but I'm not sure.  

B.100:   You know, I think you are right.  I think it is Raleigh.  

A.101:   Think so?  

B.102:   I think I remember hearing that.  

A.103:   Uh-huh.  Because I know they've got a (( )) football team but
I think it might be them.  

B.104:   That would be fun.  I'd like to see some more teams get in.  

A.105:   I would, definitely.  I think they are supposed to put two in
by either next year or the year after.  And right now I think
Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good
shot at it.  

B.106:   Uh-huh.  

A.107:   Because I know St. Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when
I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets
than St. Louis did.  

B.108:   Oh, really?  

A.109:   Yeah.  It's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in
Memphis holds about sixty-two,
