========================================================================

A.1:   One of the hardest things in finding child care is deciding
to let go.  What do you think?  

@B.2:   Now, what do you mean by letting go?  

A.3:   Well, like going back to work and, uh, it seems like parents
have a very difficult time, especially mothers, have a very
difficult time in, uh, finding someone, well, first off in going
back to work.  They, uh, with the little babies.  

B.4:   Uh-huh.  

A.5:   And then finding someone that satisfies them.  

B.6:   Right, right.  Well, uh, gosh, my kids are older now, so I
feel like that, that my, uh, choices are, are different -- 

A.7:   Yes.  

B.8:   -- than when I first, when I first went back to work, uh,
you're right, I, I wanted to have somebody who came into the house
and -- 

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   -- who performed, you know, certain functions and that
closeness.  And, I noticed that as the older they got, you know,
the less and less picky I got about that, uh, uh, that criteria. 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   Uh, but, you know, now, uh, you know, I wish there was
somebody, not so much to baby-sit the kids, but tutor them in
homework [laughter].  

A.13:   Oh, yeah, and help, help with the housework a little bit.  

B.14:   Really, really, so, but,  

A.15:   The, the best one I ever had was, uh, when I had only one
child and, uh, was an infant and it was an older woman and she came
to the house and, uh, she had noon meal cooked and my husband and
I -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   -- came home and ate and everything.  

B.18:   Oh, see, and that would have been wonderful.  

A.19:   Well, of course, it was extra special for us -- 

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   -- because he was a student and I had to work.  

B.22:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.23:   So, uh, that really helped.  

B.24:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, those, uh, those people who can, uh,
stay, you know, home and, and take care of the kids and, uh, you
know, do that, I think are really special people.  

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   Uh, so you just don't find that anymore.  Uh, even now the,
the day cares, though, are so expensive.  

A.27:   Oh, yeah.  

B.28:   That, uh, I don't know how parents afford them.  

A.29:   I don't either.  Well, a lot of mothers have had to quit work
because of that.  

B.30:   Right, right.  

A.31:   But, yet, one or two children, one child, and, could be fifty
to seventy five dollars a week.  

B.32:   Oh, yeah.  

A.33:   And then you get two -- 

B.34:   Uh-huh.  

A.35:   -- and it just multiplies.  

B.36:   Yeah, I, I think it's gone up to like a hundred dollars a week
and depending on, on what age they are -- 

A.37:   Yeah.  

B.38:   -- and, uh, you know, if you want quality day care to where
they have, uh, not only just their meals taken care of, those basic
necessities, but also, uh, their education, too.  

A.39:   That's true.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  Because, 

A.41:   Study time and, uh, if they watch television, it's educational
only or -- 

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   -- you know, monitor that, don't just turn them loose on it. 

B.44:   Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  So, it's a, I, I think it's changed over
the years.  Uh, but, you know, I found, uh, like I said, they, at
least when my kids were growing up that, uh, it was harder,
especially companies didn't have programs -- 

A.45:   I know.  

B.46:   -- to where they would help you find --

A.47:   Uh-huh {faint}.

B.48:   -- baby-sitters.  

A.49:   You found someone in the neighborhood if you -- 

B.50:   Uh-huh.  

A.51:   -- were lucky.  

B.52:   That's right.

A.53:   Yeah {faint}.

B.54:   That's right, because, 

A.55:   But, 

B.56:   Uh-huh.  

A.57:   Have you had any experience with people who have chosen
nannies?  

B.58:   [Lipsmack]  No, but, you know, I've read, uh, you know, some
stories, uh, about that.  

A.59:   Uh-huh.  

B.60:   And, uh, now, now I don't, do you -- 

A.61:   Well,  

B.62:   -- know of anybody?  

A.63:   I'm, I do the kind, kind of work, we, we do medical checkups
on some who are going to be nannies -- 

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:   -- and the criteria they're using are they want, they, they
require them to have certain blood tests and -- 

B.66:   Uh-huh.  

A.67:   -- [Throat_clearing] as well as their educational requirements
and -- 

B.68:   Uh-huh.   

A.69:   -- the one, nannies I've talked to who bring the children in
are very, very, uh, oh, enthusiastic about -- 

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   -- what they're doing with them and,  

B.72:   Uh-huh.  

A.73:   Uh, they present themselves well -- 

B.74:   Yeah.  

A.75:   -- but that's as close as I've come to them.  

B.76:   Yeah, no, I just, you know, read in a, uh, oh, I don't know,
the, the want columns. 

A.77:   Uh-huh.  

B.78:   Uh, but I guess when I had thought about it since I've been
a single parent for so long that, uh, you know, I wished I had the
money for something like that.  

A.79:   Oh, yeah.  

B.80:   Because of the special, uh, oh, I don't know, the, uh, the special
closeness, that bond that's formed versus taking them to a day care where they
just, they're one of many children.

A.81:   Right.  

B.82:   Yeah, so that's, a, that's, to me, that's extra special.  

A.83:   Well, there's only, I think the one good thing about day care,
of course, I'm in the grandchildren age -- 

B.84:   Uh-huh.  

A.85:   -- and one of my grandchildren needed the day care because he
needed to, the other, uh, other, uh, younger children needed to
learn to share.  

B.86:   Sure, sure.  

A.87:   He was, uh, his mother couldn't get two feet from him.  

B.88:   Right, right.  

A.89:   And, uh, they're hoping that that helps on that.  Course, that
may be just his age.  

B.90:   Yeah, it, it could be age, but, you know, I, I can never
regret, regret, uh, the children, uh, going through that day care
experience because they learned so many things.  Uh, such as
responsibility, independence, uh, you know, that sharing.  I mean,
there are a lot of good things.  I, I know there's a lot of
drawbacks to women going back to, to work -- 

A.91:   Uh-huh.  

B.92:   -- but, uh, I think there was so many positives that, that I
saw -- 

A.93:   Yeah.  

B.94:   -- uh, that I really didn't have that much guilt about it.  

A.95:   Well, good, good.  Course, what really helps is when you know
you have to, right.  

B.96:   Yeah [laughter].  That made it real easy [laughter].  

A.97:   [Laughter]. 

B.98:   But I, I,
