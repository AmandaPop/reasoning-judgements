==========================================================================

A.1:   Golfer?  

B.2:   Well, yes, I am as a matter of fact.  

A.3:   Well, 

B.4:   Not a good one, but I am a golfer.  

A.5:   Well, that's about the way I am.  I don't consider myself a
good one, but I do enjoy it.  

B.6:   I, uh, haven't been out all year.  I didn't get out this year,
but, uh, I enjoy both watching it and playing it.  

A.7:   I usually play a couple of times a month.  Sometimes more, but
lately it's been just about that.  But, I do enjoy, I think the,
one of the things I enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf
courses.  

B.8:   Yes, and, the, the peacefulness.  

A.9:   Uh-huh.  You can get out there,  

B.10:   And the little critters that are around.  

A.11:   [Laughter]. 

B.12:   [Laughter]. 

A.13:   Yeah, that's really neat.  You can just get out there and lose
yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what
you're seeing out there.  

B.14:   That's right and it's such a personal challenge.  

A.15:   Uh-huh, yeah, it really is.  

B.16:   More than competitiveness against someone else.  It's, it's
a competitiveness against yourself.  

A.17:   [Laughter] And, you know, it's so frustrating, I keep
wondering sometimes why do I do this because it's so frustrating. 
You think you do pretty good one day and you're doing a whole lot
better, you know, and then all of a sudden you go back out and it's
just terrible.  

B.18:   Well, you'll,  

A.19:   You can't do anything,   

B.20:   [Throat_clearing]. 

A.21:   right [laughter].  

B.22:   Or you'll hear thirty and think, boy -- 

A.23:   Boy, I'm improving.  

B.24:   -- I got my game together.  I've had a par and a birdie,

A.25:   [Laughter].

B.26:   and a bogey and then you quadruple bogey [laughter].  

A.27:   Uh-huh [laughter].  And you think, my goodness, why did I
think I was doing better [laughter].  

B.28:   Being down there, do you, uh, get to see, like the colonial
or any of those?   

A.29:   I don't, I guess I could.  I've never been to a golf, to a
major golf tournament.  

B.30:   Oh. 

A.31:   I, uh, watch them on T V a lot.  

B.32:   You really should go at least once.  You know, we've --

A.33:   Uh-huh.  

B.34:   -- had, uh, the P G A up here.  

A.35:   Uh-huh.  

B.36:   Uh, a-, and in Tulsa and I've been to both of them and it's
[breathing], it is so much fun to -- 

A.37:   Really?  

B.38:   -- see these players you see on T V to, and to hear that ball
go whizzing by.  

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   I mean, it's, it's like a bullet going by.  

A.41:   I'll bet, um.  

B.42:   And, you know, to, to see their concentration and yet to see
them, how friendly they are when they're, walk by you, you know,
and -- 

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   -- how good they are to their spectators.  

A.45:   Well, I've only been playing like about three years now.  My
husband's played for twenty-five.  But, I just took it up about
three years ago and, uh, we play in a lot of couple's scramble
tournaments.  We belong to a country club a little ways outside of
Dallas, and -- 

B.46:   Both,  

A.47:   -- we have developed a tremendous number of friends that -- 

B.48:   Yes.  

A.49:   -- couples do this and, you know, it's fun to go on vacations
and things and go to golf courses.  

B.50:   Yes, it is.  

A.51:   You can meet some really neat people.  

B.52:   The scrambles are fun.  

A.53:   Uh-huh, they really are.  I just love them.  

B.54:   I belong to the country club there in El Reno when I lived
there and -- 

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   -- it, you know, it, it's fun because it's so uncompetitive. 

A.57:   Uh-huh.  

B.58:   You really, on those, you really go out for fun.  

A.59:   That's right.  

B.60:   And, you know, you won't, you know you're stroke is just one
of one or two or three -- 

A.61:   Uh-huh.  

B.62:   -- or four, you know, that's going to make any difference.  

A.63:   That's right.  And you just do your own thing and be relaxed
and enjoy it [laughter].  

B.64:   That's right.  I used to, when I worked at Kerr McGee, I used
to play in their tournaments.  

A.65:   Really?  

B.66:   And, uh, now that was very competitive.  

A.67:   Really?  

B.68:   And, I enjoyed it tremendously, but, uh, I, I'm more, I think
I get more enjoyment just couple friends going out.  

A.69:   Uh-huh.  

B.70:   And if, if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the
green, so be it.  

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   You know, we just think, well, the next time has got to be
better [laughter].  

A.73:   [Laughter] Yeah, I have never played in any tournament except
just a scramble.  They have a lot of them there at the club, you
know, they have A B C D type tournaments and then they, they have
the club championships and everything with the women's slots as
well, but, I don't know, I've just never really gotten into that. 
Now, my husband and all the men, I mean, they love the real
competitiveness of playing for money, you know.  

B.74:   Oh, yes, every hole.  

A.75:   Uh-huh.  But I, I'm not good enough for that [laughter].  

B.76:   Does your club have a good woman's association?  

A.77:   Yes, they do.  I don't do much with it since, uh, most of
theirs, they have a traveling league, and, uh, most of their
meetings and all are during the week and I don't, don't get to play
except on the weekend.  I work during the week all the time.  

B.78:   It's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game.  

A.79:   Uh-huh.  Someday when I, I get where I live closer to the club
and partially retired, maybe I'll, uh, be able to play a little
more but, 

B.80:   It, uh, it's, it's a, it's a good game.  I, uh, I wish I had
more time to play and I felt, you know, had more energy to play it,
too.  

A.81:   Uh-huh.
