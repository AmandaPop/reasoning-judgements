=======================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I guess I, I've rented most of the time, so I, I haven't
done much home repair.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Uh, I do small, little, little odd jobs.

B.4:  Yeah.  I, I live here at home with my parents and, uh,
[inhaling] not too long ago, uh, we, uh, put in a, a storage room
out in the, in the back part of our hall here, we took, took part
of the garage and turned it into inside of the house, and walled
it off and put cabinets and stuff in, and took a good, gee,
probably two months to do all of it, working on weekends and
stuff like that.

A.5:  Yeah, I, I worked, uh, with a guy, uh, it was quite a few
years ago, uh, and, uh, he built his own homes, stuff like that
and --

B.6:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].

A.7:  -- I, I helped him quite a bit as from, from everything, from
the carpentry work right electrical, plumbing, just about
everything --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- so, it was kind of fun to do that.

B.10:  Yeah.  I, I worked construction on a, a new American Airlines
building, and I'm here for couple of weeks [breathing] hanging
six stories off a side of a building from scaffolding isn't my
idea of fun [laughter].

A.11:  No, no, that's, uh.

B.12:  I, I prefer to keep my feet on the ground, and like that,
[laughter] but, uh.

A.13:  Well, I had, have a jo-, kind of delves into, uh,
construction a little bit, where, uh, we worked on wooden
railroad bridges --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- and, uh, some of them, uh, in the country, uh, get pretty
high --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- and you're overlooking, uh, uh, a small body of water,
mostly rocks down there, and you're just,

B.18:  Yeah, yeah, I can imagine that's, uh,

A.19:  Yeah, so, uh, it's not fun to work too high, but, uh, you
know, the, uh, I think more what they're talking about is into
the --

B.20:  Yeah --

A.21:  -- the home.

B.22:  -- the home improvement stuff.

A.23:  Basically most of that I, you know, I've done some minor
repairs, electrically, and --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- minor repairs, plumbing, stuff like that.

B.26:  My, my dad and I always haven't to fix light switches or put
in new, uh, outlets and stuff, because, you know, mother wants
another, another outlet somewhere, so we go climbing around in
the attic and dropping wire and cutting holes in the wall.

A.27:  Yeah, yeah.  I, I enjoy doing a lot of projects like that,
but not alone.

B.28:  Yeah, yeah.

A.29:  I, I prefer having someone that, uh, has some knowledge in
that, and, and I, uh, help and learn and --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- that route, but if I had to tackle, you know, building an
addition totally by myself, uh, I wouldn't enjoy it at all.

B.32:  Yeah, it's, it's, doing something like that, you have to, you
have to plan it all out and make sure that you've got all your,
your measurements and calculations down before you ever even
start to knock a hole in the wall or something, you know.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  But, uh, we didn't, I mean, we, that, that room that we
built, we put, they, we built cabinets and stuff, and made a
little desk top, and my mom put, uh, uh, some tile on the, on the
desk top --

A.35:  Um.

B.36:  -- so it's, it's like a, it's just a flat board that has tile
on it.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  It doesn't, she doesn't ever go back and sit down and write
on it or anything.  I think she just did it for decoration.

A.39:  Um.

B.40:  But, uh.

A.41:  Sounds like quite a project there.

B.42:  Yeah, it, it was sometimes fun [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah, I guess a lot of times when you're, when you're pressed
for time and have to do it and want to get it done, then it
doesn't become fun any more.

B.44:  Right [throat_clearing].

A.45:  I think the, the smaller projects tend to be more fun. 
Something you can finish in maybe a week or something.

B.46:  Yeah, thing, things that, that, that take a long time or
you're doing them in the middle of the summer when it's hot is,
is not fun.

A.47:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, uh, especially on stuff like roofing when
you're doing it in --

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- ninety to a hundred degree weather and,

B.50:  And the sun's bouncing off the roof to start with, and so you
it's even hotter, and --

A.51:  Yeah, for sure.

B.52:  -- working with (( )) the, the black tar paper.  That stuff
gets really hot.

A.53:  Yeah, and then it always seems like a lot of that, uh, tile
up there is, is almost starting to melt in your hands.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  It's real hard to handle.

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  Well, I don't know about you, but I'm, I'm about out.

B.58:  Yeah, I, I, I, I think we're at a, at a loss here.

A.59:  Yeah, so I think we'll just end it short.

B.60:  Okay, it was nice talking to you.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  Bye-bye.
