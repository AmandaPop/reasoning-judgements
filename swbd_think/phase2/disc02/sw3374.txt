=======================================================================

A.1:  Um, 

B.2:  Do you want to start?  [Laughter].

A.3:  Yes.  On, uh, taking care of the elderly, do you have an older relative
that you are concerned with right now?

@B.4:  I just have one grandmother,  

A.5:  #I see.# 

B.6:  #that's, that's alive# and I'm use-, I think in her low eighties, but she
lives by herself and takes care of herself and stuff and she's healthy.

A.7:  That's very important.  

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  I tell you, I have, uh, faced this whole subject myself because my mother
is not quite that old.  But,

B.10:  #Uh-huh.#

A.11:  #she,# uh, has Parkinson's and, uh --

B.12:  Huh.   

A.13:  -- we tried taking care of her in the house, 

B.14:  #Uh-huh.#

A.15:  #and# it got to where it wasn't safe.  

B.16:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.17:  #And then,# uh, [lipsmack] we had to, to, uh, try different things and
finally she's in a nursing home.

B.18:  Huh.  Did you hear they are coming closer to a cure for Parkinson's?

A.19:  ((Huh-uh)).  I hope so.  

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  Because it really is a bad disease.  

B.22:  Because a lot of people in, uh, I think a country like Guam or something
have it,

A.23:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.24:  #so,# um, they are studying those people and coming closer to a cure.

A.25:  Well, they know what causes it, 

B.26:  #What?#

A.27:  #uh,# and, you know, it's a, an insufficiency in the brain.  

B.28:  Uh-huh.  I think th-, it was on the news and they mentioned, 

A.29:  #Yeah.# 

B.30:  #something like that,# 

A.31:  #But, uh,# 

B.32:  #some chemical.#

A.33:  so far they haven't, uh, that I know of they haven't figured out why
there's a deficiency and --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- the medicine they give them is supposed to replace it but it,

B.36:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.37:  #it# doesn't.  It also has side affects.  

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  How do you feel about having to, 

B.40:  #[Throat_clearing].# 

A.41:  #place# someone in a nursing home?  

B.42:  Well, I hope I can take care of my parents someday.  I hope I can afford
to.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  Um, um, I guess it depends on what the nursing home is [laughter] like
because there's some very nice ones that I wouldn't mind checking into it,

A.45:  #Well,# 

B.46:  #myself.#        

A.47:  Well -- 

B.48:  And, 

A.49:  -- I think another part of it, it depends on whether you are, uh,
physically able to do it.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  To give them the care they need.  

B.52:  Uh-huh, that's true.  If you have to work, you know, you don't have a
choice.

A.53:  Well, and then too, uh, I found that even if I didn't work -- 

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- I couldn't holdup -- 

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  -- to taking care of mother twenty-four hours a day.  

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  #Because,# 

B.60:  #It's hard work.#  

A.61:  it just, uh, uh, you know, she couldn't do anything by herself.

B.62:  #Uh-huh.#

A.63:  #And,# uh, her mind wonders and she wonders [laughter]. 

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  And, uh, I've tried it on weekends and stuff and my feeling on it,

B.66:  #Uh-huh.#

A.67:  #is that# the nursing home is there if you need it -- 

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  -- but you hope you don't need it.  

B.70:  Uh-huh.   

A.71:  [Lipsmack]  And I think your health is impor-, as important as theirs.

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  Um, have you ever thought about what, uh, kind of things you would look for
in a nursing home if you ever had to choose?

B.74:  Well, I guess just a nice caring environment for one thing.  

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  And just cheery atmosphere.  Um, I've gone to this nursing home over on,
uh, Forest Lane and,

A.77:  #Huh.# 

B.78:  #Greenville# out there.  

A.79:  Yes.  

B.80:  Um, just for like field trips.  I'm a teacher.

A.81:  Yes.  

B.82:  And I take my students to nursing homes because, um -- 

A.83:  Good.  

B.84:  -- we study old age and stuff, and, um, there's, this one particular one
over there that I visited that was really nice and --

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- the director would hug the elderly people, you know, 

A.87:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.88:  #hello# and, um, we the days we were there we played games with them and --

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  -- just real nice atmosphere.  Real cheerful.  

A.91:  #That's good.# 

B.92:  #atmosphere# and it's a gorgeous nursing home too.  Um, 

A.93:  They love the, the older people love to be around children too.

B.94:  Uh-huh, and the kids I have to like drag them out of there too so,

A.95:  [Laughter] Isn't that great?

B.96:  Uh-huh.  I think it's mutual.

A.97:  Yeah.  That's #great.#

B.98:  #So,# like a grandparent or something.

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  So, um, #I don't know.#

A.101:  #Of course,#

B.102:  #If I could,#

A.103:  #(( )),#

B.104:  um, put my parents in a place like that I wouldn't feel bad,

A.105:  #Uh-huh.#

B.106:  #you know.#

A.107:  Well, I think the wor-, worst thing about having to do it is the guilt you
do feel.

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  And I think the first thing is you have to be absolutely sure that's what
you need to do.

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  And, uh, I know, in my situation we had to consider nursing care and, uh,

B.112:  Uh-huh.  #That's (( )) medical,#

A.113:  #the doctor is available# and the fact that it's clean and,

B.114:  #Uh-huh.#

A.115:  #you also# have to, you have to, uh, pay attention to how much it costs
too.

B.116:  Huh.  Yeah, I bet because it can probably cost a fortune.

A.117:  Uh-huh.  It, it can and it costs more than most people make in a year.

B.118:  Huh.

A.119:  But, #uh,#

B.120:  #Does# insurance help cover it at all or,

A.121:  There is a special insurance you can buy --

B.122:  Uh-huh.

A.123:  -- for nursing home insurance.  In fact, my husband and I take it
[laughter].

B.124:  Huh.

A.125:  Because, we hope we never have to use it.

B.126:  Uh-huh.

A.127:  But, uh, it would, uh, take care of an interim period until, you know, if
it was a long-term care until Medicaid,

B.128:  #Uh-huh.#

A.129:  #would# kick in.

B.130:  #Do you have children or,#

A.131:  #Because Medica-,# uh, pardon?

B.132:  Do you have children?

A.133:  Yes.  I have four.

B.134:  Uh-huh.

A.135:  Uh-huh.  But, uh,

B.136:  So you have, um, plenty of people to take care of you some day.

A.137:  Well, um,
