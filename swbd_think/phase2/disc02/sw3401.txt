============================================================================

A.1:  So what do you think?

B.2:  Well, shoot, I think they ought to have it.  I think they ought to have,
uh, uh, you know, a health care for everybody.

A.3:  Um.

B.4:  My, my only problem is, uh, uh, I don't want to pay for it [laughter].

A.5:  This is true.  I'm paying enough as it is.

B.6:  Well, uh, they've had some really startling discoveries recently as to how
much things cost that the, uh, at a hospital and health care --

A.7:  Yes, I know.

B.8:  -- I think the health care, the costs have really gone crazy.

A.9:  Yeah, see, I had, I had surgery in July, so, you talking to, yeah, they got
the right two persons on the phone.  I think they ought to do something,
either make it so everybody can afford it, or do something about controlling
these peo-, these doctors and these bills.

B.10:  Well.

A.11:  It don't make no sense to charge, because, okay, I had breast surgery.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  They charged me eighty dollars for a bra.  Now you know, that's ridiculous.

B.14:  Wow.  Really?

A.15:  I mean, you can't, you can go get one made for forty.

B.16:  What, uh, what, what bothers me is, uh, my wife was in [ringing] just for a
little bit and she went in to the emergency room.  They charged, they had two
needles, one was like [ringing] twenty-seven dollars.  One was twenty-eight
dollars --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- for a needle.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  And that stuff just, uh, is just completely out of line.  

A.21:  I think they need to char-, if they're going to, if they're going to be
like, I wish they could almost be like Russia, except for, then you be worried
about who gets what care.  See what I mean.

B.22:  Yeah, yeah.

A.23:  If you old, are they just not going to work on you, to me, you know, but if
you got insurance, you know, that's supposed to help, but, who, who's, who's
going to determine what, if they do it that way, see --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- that would, that would bother me.  So, I think that they need to do
something, they need to get a hold of it, because it's definitely going up.

B.26:  Now, we, we were in, uh, my wife went into the emergency room, and she was,
we were there for about four hours --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and it came out to about fifteen hundred dollars.

A.29:  Well, I was in the hospital for one day, my surgery was five hours, and
they charged me six thousand dollars, sixty-eight hundred dollars, I'm sorry,
and that was just for the hospital.

B.30:  That was just, just for the hospital?

A.31:  You know, the hospital and the surgery.  That didn't include the doctor.

B.32:  That wasn't a doctor?

A.33:  No.

B.34:  Whoa.  I sure hope you had insurance.  

A.35:  Well, see, that's the only reason why I didn't, see I had Kaiser insurance.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  So the, the doctor and everything like that was paid for, but if I, if I
didn't have Kaiser, then I would have to pay the doctor, too.

B.38:  So it's like an H M O?

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  Wow.

A.41:  So you think about the six, I didn't pay six thousand dollars.  Don't get
me wrong.  Medical City, I mean, the doctor, Kaiser paid it, but it's the idea
that they billed them that much money.

B.42:  Yeah.  Gee.

A.43:  They're not, you, you, you know, they charge you for every-, that's just
like they charged me five dollars, three dollars for a phone and two dollars
for the T V or whatever.  I was knocked out.  How was I supposed to know what
I supposed to do?  I didn't need a phone.  I didn't need the T V because I was
knocked out, and by the time I woke up it was time to go home.  So, you know,
to me, that's unnecessary.

B.44:  Wow.  Six thousand dollars.

A.45:  Yeah.  That's how much, and that's not, that's just the ro-, the, the, what
do you call it, the, the operating room [barking] cost me three thousand
dollars.  The recovery room was like a, uh, another six hundred.

B.46:  Wow.  For a day.

A.47:  No, for just, I, I'm talking hours here [barking].  The hospital room was
four hundred dollars for one day.

B.48:  I'd want to stay in there that whole day.  

A.49:  Well, I, I did, more or less, because I went in early that morning, okay --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- I had surgery.  I went home the following morning [barking].  You see
what I'm saying.  I went home --

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  -- by twelve or [barking] something like that.  So they consider that one
whole day.

B.54:  Jeez [barking].
 
A.55:  But they charge me for the, the operating room and everything used in the
operating room [laughter].

B.56:  Probably even the electricity [barking].

A.57:  Well, that's the time that they charge you for, you know, the time
[barking] and the, and the, they even charged me, now I went and gave my own
blood.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  They charged me to give me my own blood back.

B.60:  No.

A.61:  Yes, they did.  They charged me to heat it up and, and check it, and
everything, because even if it was mine.  I told them they didn't have to
check it, it was mine [laughter].

B.62:  Well, what, uh, jeez, I wonder what they would have charged you if you had
somebody else's blood.

A.63:  I don't know.  I don't want to think about that.

B.64:  Jeez.  What'd they charge you for that?

A.65:  Check it, just to cross check --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- was a hundred twenty dollars.

B.68:  How many, how many pints?  [Barking].

A.69:  Two pints [barking] --

B.70:  Gee.

A.71:  -- of my blood.
