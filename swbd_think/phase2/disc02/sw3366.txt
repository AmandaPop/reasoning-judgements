=======================================================================

A.1:   Uh, uh, do you have any, uh, particular books that you've read
lately that are, are good books that you've enjoyed?  

B.2:   I haven't read much lately.  I've always, reading is one of my
favorite things but somehow the last few months I just haven't
read.  I've read more magazines then books and which is most
unusual for me, but, um, have you read anything lately?  

A.3:   Not real lately.  When they came up with this topic I thought,
gee, I read a lot of books and [laughter], 

B.4:   [Laughter]. 

A.5:   now I thought what have I read lately [laughter].

@B.6:   We-, [laughter] I can't, I know I read a bunch a few months
back but I can't remember the titles [laughter]. 

A.7:   [Lipsmack]  Oh.  Isn't that funny.  

B.8:   Oh.  

A.9:   I will have to say,

B.10:   I'd have to go look around my room for the books I've read
[laughter] and they're still stacked there [laughter].

A.11:   Oh.  Well, it seems like I have read a lot of children's books
lately [laughter]. 

B.12:   Well now I have too [laughter].

A.13:   To my, my kids and things like that but,

B.14:   Well, I have grandchildren,  

A.15:   Oh.  

B.16:  and, uh, the oldest is two but he, you know, loves books so,
so I have read more of those myself,

A.17:   [Laughter]. 

B.18:   lately.  I did buy the sequel to, uh, GONE WITH THE WIND
the other day.  

A.19:   Oh.  

B.20:   And I've read the first chapter and, and I thought it was real
good and I have not even picked it back up, [laughter] you know.  

A.21:   Huh.  

B.22:   And GONE WITH THE WIND is my all-time favorite book, 

A.23:   Oh.  

B.24:  you know, so you would have thought I'd have had the whole
thing read by now.  

A.25:   Is it by the same author?  

B.26:   No, uh, no.  See Margaret Mitchell died, uh, oh, maybe ten
years after she wrote GONE WITH THE WIND and she, 

A.27:   Oh.  

B.28:  that's the only book she ever wrote.  And, uh, so the heirs to
her estate, after fifty years, picked this Alexandra ((Ripley)), I
think is her name,  

A.29:   {Very faint}  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  to write the sequel which she did.  And,

A.31:   Well, that may, that may be the reason you can't get into it
as, as much.  

B.32:   No, no.  It, 

A.33:   Oh.

B.34:  it was very good.  It brought all those characters back to
life. 

A.35:   Oh.  

B.36:   I just, 

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:  I just, well, I don't know.  I've just been busy, and I just
haven't read where I've, I used to find time [laughter]. 

A.39:   Yeah.  I, you know, if I get reading a book I like to just
close the door and just read, you know, and even stay up really
late at night and -- 

B.40:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.41:   -- and just stay into it until I finish.  Uh,

B.42:   I used to be that way [laughter]. 

A.43:   Yeah.  Sometimes it is hard to do that with our lives.

B.44:   Well, I get, well, I'm fifty-three and I, you know, I just get
sleepy and I go to bed early.  So where I used to do that years
ago, I don't anymore.  And I do, I work.  My husband is an
accountant and we moved our office home about two years ago.  

A.45:   Oh.  

B.46:   So I work at home but I have a lot of work to do, you know. 

A.47:   Uh-huh.  

B.48:   And, uh, then when I'm not doing that, like I have my
grandkids a lot because my daughter travels, and she has a twenty
month and then a four month.  

A.49:   Oh.  

B.50:   [Laughter]  So, that's why we are going to Plano today.  

A.51:   I s-,

B.52:   That's where we pick them up at day care [laughter]. 

A.53:  Oh, I see.  [lipsmack] Well, some of the books that I have read, uh, that
I really enjoyed getting into was, uh, the one Ellen ((Drurey)) books, you
know, ADVISE AND CONSENT and have you ever read any of those?

B.54:   Now is that like a classic?  

A.55:   Yeah, it really is.  Um,

B.56:   I mean, I mean written quite a ways back that you like maybe
read in high school or something?  Or am I thinking of a different
one with that name?

A.57:   It's been around awhile but it's not, you know, it's not from
the eighteen hundreds or anything.  This is, it's a book, um, it's
written in the nineteen hundreds and it's written, uh, about what
goes on in Washington, you know, 

B.58:   Oh, no, 

A.59:  with the Senate and the House and --

B.60:  that's not what I was thinking of.  

A.61:   -- the President and everything.  And, uh, it really gets into
kind of the wheeling and dealing type thing and -- 

B.62:   {Very faint}  Oh, yeah.  

A.63:   -- it's just, it gets really fascinating.  I didn't think
something like that would catch, 

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:  my interest but, uh, the way it's written and everything, it
is excellent.  It just really, uh, it is well worth reading.  

B.66:   I'll be darned.  Okay.  Well, I sure wish I could remember
what [laughter] I've read,  

A.67:   [Laughter]. 

B.68:  [Laughter] so I could tell you that,

A.69:   Oh.  

B.70:  [Laughter] I did read that.  Oh, gosh.  

A.71:   There's another book out that is called ALL I EVER wh-, uh,
NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN.  Have you ever heard 
of,

B.72:   Now I have seen that.  What is that about?  

A.73:   That is just real cute.  It's, uh, it's just got a lot of
ideas in it about basic things, you know, that we do and, uh,
[lipsmack] you know, things that you learn in kindergarten that,
that really apply to your life.  Um --

B.74:   Oh, uh-huh.  

A.75:   -- there is one little section in there that, that talks
about, um, uh, holding hands and sticking together and, uh, you
know having cookies and milk and wouldn't it be nice if we could
all still take a nap [laughter], 

B.76:   [Laughter]. 

A.77:  in the afternoon, you know.  And it's,
