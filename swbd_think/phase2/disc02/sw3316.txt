========================================================================

A.1:  Feel about this?  

B.2:  Well, I've, I've seen all kinds of carnage and I'm very much in favor of
laws to restrict the access to guns.

A.3:  I am, too.  

B.4:  Uh, I, you know, I cannot understand the, the argument on the other side.

A.5:  Yeah, I, I hear the argument of, uh, you don't have anything to protect
yourself with and, and all this that I just, I don't know, I don't know.
There's a guy at work, you know, that's trying to get a gun for his wife
because she works in a divorce type position --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- and she's scared that somebody might turn on her sometime, and, I'm
like, why do people need guns in their desk at work.  I just don't understand
that.

B.8:  I don't understand, either.  Now, there prob-, there probably are cases --

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  -- of certain occupations, certain, actually, certain individuals --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- in certain occupations who would, for who that may be legitimate.

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  Uh, but there are whole countries where guns are banned.  Uh, I think in
the United Kingdom of Japan where the homicide rates are far, far lower --

A.15:  Uh-huh. 

B.16:  -- than the United States.  I don't see how it possibly makes sense for us
to have all these guns lying about.

A.17:  Oh, I don't either.  And you can go to a store and pick out which one you
want and just, you know, it's, it's weird to have something like that.  You
know, I've never been a hunter or have been around anything like that, that,
uh, there have been guns in the house or anything like that.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  And to see those kids having, you know, like you see on the news, these
kids, like, are you in Dallas or, 

B.20:  No, I'm in Washington.  

A.21:  In Washington.  

B.22:  Yes.  

A.23:  Okay, well we just had an acc-, accident here that, uh, a fifteen year old
got into a f-, uh, you know, like you always do in school.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  High school, you know, you always had little fights with kids.

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Well, he had a fight with a kid and his older brother who's eighteen came
to the school and shot the kid --

B.28:  Yes.  

A.29:  -- and killed him.  And I'm like, what in the world [laughter] are these
kids, and then they confiscated twenty-three guns from that high school out of
lockers.  And it's like --

B.30:  That's a-, that's amazing, yeah.  

A.31:  -- I just can't understand why these kids have guns.  It's just awful --

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  -- to see something like that.  

B.34:  Yeah, well, it happens a lot around here, too.  

A.35:  Does it?  

B.36:  Uh, in fact, maybe even worse.  

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  In terms of frequency.  Uh, drive by shootings in high schools, and, you
know.

A.39:  Yeah, we had quite a few drive by shootings recently with buses of, uh, you
know, the public transportation buses.

B.40:  Yes.  

A.41:  And like, I think two people were killed during that -- 

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- when they were having just kids were driving by and shooting out the
windows.

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  And, uh, and then we had that killing, you know, in Killeen. 

B.46:  Yes.  

A.47:  I don't know in you heard about that.  

B.48:  Uh, uh, everybody heard about that.  

A.49:  Yeah [laughter], I think so.  And that happened and that was something
else.

B.50:  Yeah.  

A.51:  So,  

B.52:  So I'm, I'm, I think on the scale at the one end, you know. 

A.53:  Yeah.  

B.54:  Uh,  

A.55:  I, I'd be close to the eight, nine and ten area.  

B.56:  That, wait, I thought, uh, uh, eight, nine, ten was no restrictions.

A.57:  Oh, I thought ten was the b-, oh, I'm sorry.  

B.58:  Whatever, whatever, we're down at the same end.  

A.59:  Heavy duty -- 

B.60:  Whatever end that is.  

A.61:  -- restrictions [laughter].  That's, I feel in favor for because you just
can't be handing these things out to anybody.

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  And, and you're getting them sold to people and then they're getting into
the wrong hands.

B.64:  Yeah, would you somehow get them away from those who already have them?

A.65:  What's that?  

B.66:  Would you somehow disarm those who are already armed?  

A.67:  Uh, {pause} yes.  

B.68:  How would you do that?  

A.69:  Uh, do, you know, do they, don't they have records of the people who own
the, uh, guns that were bought?

B.70:  In many cases, not.  Uh,  

A.71:  Yeah, I know it.  

B.72:  Because many cases they're, they're stolen.  Uh, {pause} I --

A.73:  Right.

B.74:  -- I, I have no idea --

A.75:  Underground type.

B.76:  -- what the statistics are on that, but, uh,

A.77:  Underground type, uh, selling --  

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  -- of guns.  Yeah, I don't know how, you know, it's going to, it's going to
have to happen [laughter] sometime.  But it, right now --

B.80:  Yeah {faint}.

A.81:  -- there hasn't been a way.  

B.82:  Yeah.  I don't know this for absolute fact, but I have a suspicion that the
gun industry that manufactures --

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  -- these things and also those who, dealers who sell them are, are a major
force behind the N R A.

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  And all these campaigns that, that stir people up and try to get them to,
uh,

A.87:  To, uh, not ban them.  

B.88:  To, to, right.  To oppose them.  

A.89:  Right.  

B.90:  Because they have an economic reason over and above whatever --

A.91:  Oh, sure.  

B.92:  -- the, their private preferences are.  

A.93:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it, it's a tough thing.  

B.94:  Until, the thing has to be won on an economic ground, too.  

A.95:  Right.  

B.96:  So there has to be some way to compensate those who lose at the,

A.97:  So that they don't keep -- 

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  -- you know, saying don't ban.  

B.100:  Right.  

A.101:  So, uh, yeah, it's, it's tough [noise].  I don't know what they're going to
do and, you know, I, there's got to be a way to get them out of the hands of,
and, plus for them to, when they do have them [noise], to, you know, they keep
them in these areas where their kids can get to them --

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  -- and, and hurt, you know, and they're young enough they don't even know
what they're playing with.  They're playing with something they saw on T V.

B.104:  Uh-huh.  

A.105:  And, uh, you know, it's, it's not safe at all for, uh, the kids in the home
even.  Because they don't keep them under lock and key anyway.

B.106:  Right.

A.107:  They keep them in their top drawer or, and then they say, well, if we
unload them, then how are we going to have time to load,
