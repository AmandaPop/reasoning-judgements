A.1:  Tell me what you like to do.

B.2:  Well, [laughter] I, I collect antique tools, uh, for one
thing, I well, I'm sort of in an antique business, but it's a
little -- 

A.3:  Oh.

B.4:  -- sideline, part time thing.

A.5:  Uh-huh, wonderful.

B.6:  And, uh, I'm building a, a log house at a farm that I have in
East Texas, which is --

A.7:  Oh.

B.8:  -- a hundred miles from here.

A.9:  Wonderful.

B.10:  Yeah, it's really neat.  And, uh, uh, course I've been
working on it for five years, but, you know,

A.11:  Oh, but how wonderful.  Are you close to getting it done?

B.12:  Yeah, yeah, it's getting real close to --

A.13:  Oh.

B.14:  -- you know, of course there's still a lot of work to be
done, and then when you get it completely, you know, the shell
finished, uh, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside, but, uh,

A.15:  Are you going to move your whole family over there then?

B.16:  No, actually, uh, I'm not even sure, I may, I'll probably
always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas [noise].

A.17:  Uh-huh, kind of your getaway place.

B.18:  Yeah, escape.  But it's beautiful, it's, you know, it's
Eastern Hardwood, uh, forest, there are a lot of pine trees, but
it's mostly oaks and (( )).

B.20:  Well, it's kind of, hilly, but, it's, you know, low hills,
it's not, uh,

A.21:  See, I've only been to Texas once.  I have two sisters in
Texas now, um, one in Austin, one in Dallas, and the one in
Dallas is the one that got me to doing this --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- and, uh, I thought Austin was beautiful --

B.24:  You,

A.25:  -- I liked the hills --

B.26:  Yeah, in Aus-,

A.27:  -- and the trees,

B.28:  Yeah, it's really different because that's kind of the, you

year, so, it's been a real interesting thing for them [laughter]. 

B.44:  That's great.

A.45:  But they seem to like it okay.  I think they're too far away
from me, but --

B.46:  Well, yeah,

A.47:  -- maybe some day they can get closer, we'll see.

B.48:  Pretty good trip.  So what do you, what kind of hobbies are

little Halloween talent show tonight, and, [inhaling] I
substitute at the schools part-time.  

B.52:  Oh, that's great.

A.53:  Well, I am a travel agent at heart, and my hobby is just, I
love traveling and, and being involved of that and finding out
more, uh, but, it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays
and weekends when you have four children and a husband, so --

B.54:  No, kidding.

A.55:  -- I reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting
at the school, so I've been librarian all this week, which has
been real interesting, and I'm enjoying it.  I'm around my kids
