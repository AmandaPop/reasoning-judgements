A.1:  Well, what's your favorite baseball team, Rita?

@B.2:  Well, I suppose I'm supposed to say the Rangers, right [laughter].
Is that what I-,

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  is the million dollar question here?

A.5:  Well, that isn't a, a true false or right or wrong test here.

B.6:  [Laughter] Yeah.  Uh, uh, you know, I would like to say the Rangers, but
unfortunately they're not.  I was from Illinois, and my favorite team was the
White Sox.

A.7:  Not a Cubbies fan, huh.

B.8:  No, no, my family, my dad was, but I turned out to be a White Sox fan.

A.9:  Well, that's all right.  

B.10:  I lived in Chicago.  

A.11:  How do you expect them to do this year?

B.12:  Yeah they did pretty well.

A.13:  Okay.

B.14:  What did you think of the World Series?

A.15:  Well, I'll tell you.  I just, uh, moved down from South Dakota in July,
and, uh, in South Dakota, the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional
sports team to where I was living --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and so everybody was a Twins fan, and I was kind of, uh, didn't have
much interest in the Twins, you know, it was, it was kind of pathetic, I mean,
we only had two radio stations, and one of them broadcast every Twins game
live, you know, and, and the other one was country.

B.18:  [Laughter] So you didn't really have a lot of choice, did you.

A.19:  [Laughter] So, that's right.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  There's was Twins there, or, you know --

B.22:  Or country.

A.23:  -- Skip Williams.

B.24:  Yeah.  Oh, uh, and I was routing for the Twins myself because, uh, they, a
couple of Ranger players that I had watched when we first moved here, uh, went
to Minnesota, and we used to tease about, my son and I used to have a bet
going about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota, but it
was int-, it certainly was an exciting Series, anyway.

A.25:  It sure was, it sure was.

B.26:  What do you think going to happen to the Rangers?

A.27:  Well, I --

B.28:  Or can we predict?

A.29:  -- I would like to a-, a-, assume that they're going to do, do better this
coming year, I was sure hopeful anyway.  When we moved down, uh, I was able to
go to my first, you know baseball game, and --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- thought, this is great, this is incredible.  So I became a Rangers fan.
I didn't really have one in South Dakota.  So I adopted the Rangers, or rather
they adopted me, I guess --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, uh, it was just exciting, you know, you can watch baseball on T V
and they hit the long ball, and it looks like wow, they really hit that ball.
But when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far --

B.34:  No.

A.35:  -- you know, and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you,
and.

B.36:  Oh, isn't it though.  You know, but, oh, I, I think going to the ball park
just really makes it.  Because then you watch it on T V you feel like you're
more a part of it too.

A.37:  That's right, that's right.

B.38:  Well, I'm a great sports enthusiast, so I love, you know, baseball teams,
and they, in fact, on the news tonight, Nolan Ryan was on there.  He was
being, he was put in the, which I never knew existed, the Restaurant Hall of
Fame [laughter].

A.39:  The Restaurant Ha-,

B.40:  The Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight, and --

A.41:  Huh.

B.42:  -- he, uh, says he's coming back, you know, uh, he doesn't know how many
years --

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  -- I mean, to pitch.  He'll be at least one more, and he said he's been
saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more.  He
likes it.

A.45:  That's right --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- and he's still doing great --

B.48:  That's right.

A.49:  -- still doing excellent.

B.50:  You know, and he said, I get a kick out of it, you know, he's, he's such a
nice man.

A.51:  Well, didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers?

B.52:  Yeah, and he, you know when he quits at being active, he will go into, you
know --

A.53:  Management.

B.54:  -- being a, managing and, yeah, you know, being a coach, I'm sure.

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  But, he's, uh, he certainly is a good example, uh, for the kids.

A.57:  That's right.

B.58:  You know, you like to have someone like that you could point to say, see
what a fine man, that, he is.

A.59:  You know, some of the, like, uh, Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when,
when, uh, Nolan Ryan started pitching.

B.60:  That's right.

A.61:  And it's just incredible to think that there's, uh, there are players who
are the sons of ball players that used to play against Nolan --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- or with Nolan, you know, and now their sons are.

B.64:  Oh, he's been a legend for so many years, you know, and I don't know, were
you here, had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at U T with his
son.  His son pitched for U T and he pitched for an exhibition game for the
Rangers.

A.65:  Uh-huh, I wasn't.

B.66:  Yeah, it was a, I think it was a little early part of the summer, and uh,

A.67:  Was it Nolan against, uh --

B.68:  Nolan against.

A.69:  -- Ryan against Ryan, huh.

B.70:  Ryan against Ryan, yeah, his son pitched for U T --

A.71:  Well that is neat.

B.72:  -- and, uh, only, uh, Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he
didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  A game is a game, you know.  Well, the Rangers really, uh, knocked the
socks off of them, which you would expect --

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  -- you know, anyway, but Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of
innings or something, you know, of the game so,
