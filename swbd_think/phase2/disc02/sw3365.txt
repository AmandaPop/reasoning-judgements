B.1:   Hi, this is Donna Donahue. 

A.2:   Hi, Donna. 

B.3:   Hi.  

A.4:   Ready to get started?

B.5:   Uh, yeah, I think so.  

A.6:   Okay.  [beep]  Sort of an interesting topic since I just got
back from lunch here  [laughter].

B.7:   Okay.  Well, what did you have for lunch?  

A.8:   Oh, it was, uh, [laughter] it was, I'm an officer in the Air
Force, 

B.9:   Oh.  

A.10:   and we went to the Officers' Club for a little Mexican food
today.  

B.11:   Oh.  Well, that's interesting.  

A.12:   Yeah.  

B.13:   Okay.  So our topic is, is food today, is that,

A.14:   Yeah.  

B.15:   Okay.  

A.16:   If you're having a dinner party, what, what would you serve? 

B.17:   Okay, [lipsmack] uh, do you want me to go first?  

A.18:   Sure.  

@B.19:  Okay.  If I was having a dinner party I would probably, um,
have some, um, some, uh, um, some fruit to start with with some
apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and
grapes and, um, probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe
have some, uh, uh, salsa and chips around and peanuts.  And then I
would have, um, let's see.  I usually have like a little theme when
I have a dinner party so.  

A.20:   Uh-huh.  

B.21:   Um, I would have maybe, um, say if it was like Greek night or
something -- 

A.22:   Uh-huh.  

B.23:   -- um, maybe, um, [lipsmack] on the barbecue we'd put, uh,
cubes of lamb or I guess lamb used for Greek.  And, um, like a
shish kabob, 

A.24:   Uh-huh.  

B.25:  and, um, mushrooms and tomatoes and onions and then we'd have,
um, [lipsmack] like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar
salad.  

A.26:   Uh-huh.  

B.27:   And, um, let's see what else.  Um, maybe some rolls and, um,
I guess some, uh, some rice or something like that.  How does that
sound?  [laughter]. 

A.28:   Jeez, well, well, when is the party here?  [laughter].

B.29:   Yeah.  [laughter]  Um, yeah, that would take some planning 
but, 

A.30:   I don't know being a, being the bachelor here that I am, I, I
don't think I'd, I'd be a-, b-, I mean it, it's not a question of
capability here to do something like that.  It's just there's,
there's no motivation.  

B.31:   That's right.  

A.32:   You know, I want to, I want to throw some charcoal on the
grill and, and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and
stuff like that but, um,

B.33:   Well, that sounds good too.  I have, um, I have three kids -- 

A.34:   Uh-huh.  

B.35:   -- so, um, when we have friends over I have my oldest kind of
baby-sit for the little two younger ones upstairs and, um, usually
we just have very plain kind of, you know, interesting, not very
interesting meals.  

A.36:   Uh-huh.  

B.37:   Pizza and that ((all so)) once in a while when we do something
like that it's kind of fun, but it's not a, 

A.38:   Yeah.

B.39:  not a regular thing.  [laughter]  Um,

A.40:   Yeah.  

B.41:   Now are we supposed to talk for about five minutes, is that
it?  

A.42:   Yeah, that's what they, 

B.43:   Okay.  

A.44:  they are shooting for here.  

B.45:   Okay.  Um, let's see now wh-, okay, so you would have a
barbecue wouldn-,

A.46:   Well, I live on a, I live on a lake here, 

B.47:   Uh-huh.  

A.48:  and, uh, so it, and then during the summertime it's real nice
to be able to entertain outdoors, 

B.49:   Oh, sure.  

A.50:  like that's a little more a casual thing.  But in ((mine)) the
wintertime it's not bad too because then I've got a, a fireplace
and a nice, nice house and all that so we,

B.51:   Uh-huh.  

A.52:  sort of, a,

B.53:   Oh, that sounds wonderful.  

A.54:  really good place to do entertaining like that.  I just
haven't, uh, really tried a whole lot but, uh -- 

B.55:   Uh-huh.  

A.56:   -- I don't know, let's see.  I have had, well, one time I did
have a dinner party.  I served a, uh, uh, I had a gang of people
over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits, 

B.57:   Uh-huh.  

A.58:  and kind of southern, uh, southern food even though I'm up
here in New York, so [laughter].

B.59:   Oh, you are in New York right now?  

A.60:   Yeah.  

B.61:   Oh.  I'm, I'm in Texas.  I didn't know this was all, from all
over the whole country.  

A.62:   Oh, yeah.  Yeah, 

B.63:   Oh, I see.  

A.64:  it is.  It's,

B.65:   And I'm fr-, originally from Long Island.  

A.66:   Oh, no kidding?

B.67:   Yes, and now where are you in New York?  

A.68:   Upstate.  

B.69:   Oh, upstate.

A.70:   Rome.  In, uh, 

B.71:   Oh, okay.

A.72:  ((Griffins)) Air Force Base.  

B.73:   Oh, okay.  Is that where you, you are originally from around
there?  

A.74:   Well, I was born in Buffalo, 

B.75:   Oh, okay.  

A.76:  and, uh, been all over the place.  

B.77:   Oh, wow.  That's interesting.  Okay, let's see.  Um, well, I
like to have, um, sometimes when I have a dinner party I'll have,
um, everybody bring something, 

A.78:   Yeah.  

B.79:  and that's real interesting because then you get different,
um, different kinds of foods and new recipes and, um, uh, sometimes
somebody will be bring something that you really like, 

A.80:   Right.  

B.81:  and get the recipe from them or whatever.  And we are just
getting interested in, in Mexican food because here in Texas they
have lots of, 

A.82:   Uh-huh.  

B.83:  really good Mexican restaurants and,

A.84:   Sure.  

B.85:  um, we're, we're just getting into the fajitas and all that
stuff that you could, do you know what a fajita is?  

A.86:   Yeah.  Yeah,

B.87:   Yeah.  

A.88:  I've been down to Texas a few times, 

B.89:   Okay.  

A.90:  and, uh, had, uh, the pleasure of their good Mexican,  

B.91:   Yes.  

A.92:  cuisine down there.  

B.93:   They have some delicious, delicious things, and I, um, since
I always make chicken burritos and just -- 

A.94:   Uh-huh.  

B.95:   -- take chicken breasts and you boil them, maybe like four
chicken breasts, and you boil them until they are cooked.  

A.96:   Uh-huh.  

B.97:   Maybe like thirty minutes and then you debone them and, and
kind of shred them up into the meat ((that has gotten)) cooled and
you take, um, s-, little bit, maybe two tablespoons of butter and
a fr-, in a big frying pan.  And chop up some onion and put in
oregano and salt,
