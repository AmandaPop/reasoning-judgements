=======================================================================

A.1:  Did you hear, I guess you heard the subject.  Right?

B.2:  Uh, right.  Magazines.

A.3:  Right, well, I tell you, I'm about a magazine junkie.  So this is right up
my alley [laughter].

B.4:  Oh, good, okay, well go ahead and start and --

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  -- pick one.

@A.7:  Well, see, I subscribe to CONSUMER REPORT, TEXAS MONTHLY, D, TIME, my
husband's now getting HOT ROD, and then I pick up MONEY magazine and a couple
of women's, you know, if, when I stroll through the supermarket [laughter] --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- and, uh, I don't know, I just love magazines for some reason.  I even
like PEOPLE magazine, but I hate to buy it because you can read it in twenty
minutes and then you feel like you wasted your money, you know [laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter]  Well, let's see, I subscribe to BON APPETITE, uh, VOGUE,
BAZAAR, and, um, a home decorating magazine --

A.11:  Oh.

B.12:  -- that's all I can think of. 

A.13:  I bet your house looks nice, and mine is decorated the way it was seventeen
years ago [laughter].

B.14:  [Laughter].  

A.15:  [Laughter] Oh, well I'm afraid I'm not a woman's woman, by the looks of
this house I need to get a woman's woman in here to help me out [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  But I do like to cook, or I used to.  Seems like, you know, the busier you
get, that kind of, you lose out on that some.

B.18:  It is, it's difficult.  Well, let's see, you have one in particular that I
subscribed to at one time and haven't for some time, but I think is really
interesting, is CONSUMER REPORTS.

A.19:  Right, yeah, we do subscribe to that.  It is interesting.  And you really
get some surprises in there, too.

B.20:  Do you go,

A.21:  And, if you would read it religiously, you would save a lot of money.

B.22:  Well, do you actually act on any of the, uh, tips that they give you?

A.23:  Oh, yes, I, I, we really do, uh, go out and look for some of the brands,
you know, then, then we'll lose the copies or some will get thrown away or
we'll get sloppy, you know.

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  But, uh, uh, many, many times we have acted on it, yeah, because sometimes
the cheaper brand is, is better than a leading one, you know.

B.26:  It's one I probably ought to resubscribe to, you know, particularly if
you're getting ready to buy some kind of a major product --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- but it's interesting even with the everyday, you know, like the shampoos
and all --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- um, they had one, I recall, not too many years ago, that they were
talking about the various brands of shampoos and how --

A.31:  Oh, yeah, I remember that.

B.32:  -- yeah, and the most expensive ones were not the ones that they
recommended.

A.33:  I might have done that before on, uh, mascara and different kinds of
makeup, too.  Well, you know, I was at a, a wedding reception once, and there
was a girl there that was a chemist for one of the, oh, who is that, uh,
famous makeup, Mary Kaye, I think it was --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and she said, well, the truth of the matter was, there was just only a
handful of basic products you could make cosmetics out of anyway, so they were
nearly all pretty similar [laughter].

B.36:  I kind of have heard that, too, but you know, how much do you want to 
pay --

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  -- uh, for the brand to feel glamorous or whatever.

A.39:  For the packaging.

B.40:  Uh-huh, exactly.

A.41:  So, uh, and that always stood out in my mind, and I really buy a lot of
cheap, uh, lipsticks, and I think they're just as pretty and they last as long
as the real expensive ones.

B.42:  Well, I only do Maybelline mascara, because I think it's the best
[laughter].

A.43:  Right, yeah, that's what I have [laughter].

B.44:  I guess they're going to kill us if we talk about our cosmetics instead of
magazines, but,

A.45:  Oh, that's right, I forgot.  I wonder who has to listen to all this garbage
[laughter].

B.46:  I don't know, it's got to be a boring job.

A.47:  I know, this is only my second call.  I just kept forgetting about, and
then my phone wasn't working, I'd get a call every now and then, and I'd put
my PIN number in and they would say this is incorrect.  Then somebody
suggested it was the phone, sure enough we had a new phone and so then I had
to switch phones, so I'm just trying to make some calls and catch up
[laughter].

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  How many have you made?

B.50:  Uh, I was in the project oh, maybe, six or eight months ago --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- uh, and then, oh, I made maybe five, six, seven, and then they had some
problems on the system, and I just kind of got out of it.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  And this is the first one since they brought it back up again that I have
done.

A.55:  Right, oh.

B.56:  But, um, from what I understand, they get people from all over the country.

A.57:  Yeah, my daughter was on it last (( )).  We didn't know it was only
supposed to be my husband, so any time anybody called, we punched in the
number and talked, and I got the --

B.58:  Oh.

A.59:  -- and she talked to somebody several times from Virginia.

B.60:  I've never gotten anyone outside the Dallas area.  

A.61:  No, me either.  I, uh, in fact, I haven't gotten anyone over here.  I'm in
Arlington.  I usually get Garland or Mesquite --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- or Dallas [laughter].  But, it's kind of interesting, isn't it?

B.64:  Yes, it is.

A.65:  Oh, I wonder if it's really going to help them?

B.66:  Well, it helps us with our five dollars a call.

A.67:  Oh, I know.  Did you get a present or money last time?

B.68:  Yes.

A.69:  We, we got, uh, my husband works for T I, so we couldn't get the money, we
had to choose something.  Ooh neat.  We got a camera, and he got a real nice
attache case, which he needed anyway.

B.70:  Well, that's fun.

A.71:  Right.  Do you all work for T I or you just heard about it?

B.72:  No, just a friend of mine, uh, introduced me to it.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  But, uh.  Okay, I'm going to get us back on magazines.

A.75:  Oh, right, right [laughter].

B.76:  Okay, now I'm going to ask you your opinion of the, the perfume tear strips
in magazines when you get those.

A.77:  Well, I like them [laughter].

B.78:  I do too [laughter] I think they're great.

A.79:  I've heard people are allergic to them or something.

B.80:  [Laughter] Well, if you do nothing else with them, I tear them out of the
books and put them in my lingerie drawers or something.

A.81:  I just read about that in the paper the other day, and, uh, I need to do
that, that's a great idea.

B.82:  Sure.

A.83:  No, I like them a lot, and, uh, I've bought,
