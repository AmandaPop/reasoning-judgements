==========================================================================

A.1:  [Breathing] Jeri?  

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  We're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done
with it.

B.4:  That's a rather, rather broad topic [laughter].  

@A.5:  [Laughter] They're usually pretty broad anyway.  

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  Where do you live?  

B.8:  Uh, we live in Plano.  

A.9:  Okay, so, that's a,  

B.10:  Uh, and where you are?  

A.11:  I'm in Richardson, so -- 

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- when I heard the topic I was thinking of the thing down at, uh, Maceo
High School --

B.14:  Right.  

A.15:  -- in Dallas.  

B.16:  Right, that is so frightening.  

A.17:  It is, you know,  

B.18:  Uh, do you have children in school?  

A.19:  No, mine are already in college now, so -- 

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  -- I don't have to, at least when they were in high school, it was
beginning but not like the rampages.

B.22:  Well, I have, my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all
this to, to look forward to, and it is really frightening, uh, to think that
you can't even [breathing] send them to school in safety.  I mean, certainly,
you know, you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas, but, you
know, [breathing] when you can't even, send them on their normal activities in
safety, it, it's really frightening.

A.23:  That's true.  

B.24:  And, uh, [breathing] I really, you know, they're coming down on the
principal, but I really don't know [breathing] what they can do.  I mean, it's
just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to
weapons and drugs and I, I really don't know what, what can be done.

A.25:  Yeah, well, I just, I just don't understand how, of course, in my little
world, how guns could be so available.

B.26:  Well [breathing], I don't either, but apparently they just really are.  Uh
[lipsmack], I mean, to me, in Plano you would think that would be about, you
know, about as innocent as you could get for [breathing], for being in a, a
large [breathing] area.  But, you know, my son comes home and tells me that,
you know, he hears kids talk about having guns and [breathing], uh, someone
came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun.

A.27:  Oh, my heavens.  

B.28:  And, I mean, it just scared me to death and, you know, they called the
police and, and nothing happened, but my goodness [laughter], you know, it, it
could have easily.

A.29:  Well, maybe that's the answer to crime is getting [noise] more prosecution.

B.30:  Maybe so.  

A.31:  You know, because I don't, now I, somehow I feel we're living in an
impartial society as far as people seeing something happen, you know, across
the street, or seeing someone get mugged, or unfortunately, raped, and people
don't do anything.

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  A woman was raped in Richardson, I read in the paper oh, about a two weeks
ago now.  And all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help.

B.34:  Oh, no.  

A.35:  But nobody, nobody did anything.  

B.36:  I just can't imagine that.  

A.37:  You know, I mean they heard someone calling for help.  Nobody even called
the police to say, you know, I hear a strange screaming --

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  -- I'm afraid, you know, if you, I don't blame people with today's society
about going out to help themselves.

B.40:  Right, well, I can see, you know, especially if you heard screams from a
house or something, not going over there maybe, because, you know, it could be
dangerous, but certainly I can't understand not calling the police.

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  I,  

A.43:  I just, you know, it's, it's really [noise] frightening that we're not,
we're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best
things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention.

B.44:  Right.  Well I, I think you're right there.  I guess people just kind of
keep their noses pointed in their own business, but I think that's real
dangerous and, uh, I don't know.  I try to tell my kids just, just kind of be
aware of what's around them, you know and [breathing], if you see a situation
that looks like it could be trouble, just [breathing] get out of it or call
for help, whichever.

A.45:  Yes.  

B.46:  But, uh,  

A.47:  Yeah, well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it,
it just, I don't know, people just don't, I don't know, I can't say they don't
care, because people just have to care about another person.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  But it's that not getting involved, that impersonal society, I think we
live in today.

B.50:  [Breathing] Well, maybe this thing with [breathing], with the child at
school, maybe that will [lipsmack] make people think a bit more and, you know,
take some steps to, to correct it.  I don't know, it's, it really is, is
frightening.

A.51:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.52:  I, uh,  

A.53:  Let me ask you, getting back to your son's football practice because it
really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing, he didn't have a
license for the gun, correct?

B.54:  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know the details.  This was not a child that
was on the team.  It was someone that, uh, show-, you know, just kind of
showed up at the field.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  Uh, it was a, a student age person, but I'm not even,
