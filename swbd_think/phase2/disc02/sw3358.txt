=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay, um, I'm very unhandy in these things, and, uh, I don't
like to do anything myself.

B.2:  Oh, yeah.

A.3:  I like to have a service station that I can feel confident
about --

B.4:  Yeah, I, uh --

A.5:  -- which is problematical,

B.6:  -- I've been working on my car since, or actually on, on cars
since I was probably about fourteen --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- uh, I've, I've got a sixty-six Mustang out in the back
that I've been trying to get running here lately that's giving me
a lot of problems, the clutch and stuff, and working outright,
and every time I try to put the battery in it doesn't have enough
charge on it, so I have to take it over to a friend's house and
get it charged up again, and try it again.  It rained here all
last week, so I didn't get a chance to do it.

A.9:  Is, is the problem that it's hard to get the appropriate
battery and other types of things for a sixty-six car?

B.10:  Uh, no, it's not, uh, uh, I don't know exactly what it is
with the battery.  I think it's just that every time I charge it
up it, it has to sit.  I, I, I went and got a new battery and
brought it home and then it sat there for two weeks, so I went
over to a friend's house and charged it up, and then it started
raining, so I haven't been able to do it for another week, so,
I'll have to take it over there and get it charged again, and
maybe I'll be able to see if that won't get it going tomorrow. 
But, uh, but my main problem's been my clutch.  I [throat_clearing],

A.11:  Is, do you rely on this car for, for primary transportation,
or ju-,

B.12:  I'm supposed to.

A.13:  Excuse me?  I'm sorry?

B.14:  I, I said I'm supposed to.  It, uh, it's been down for quite
some time now, and I've been having a lot of trouble with it.

A.15:  So, are you struggling to get around as a result?

B.16:  Yeah, I have to rely on friends and parents and stuff like
that.  So, you, you don't do any kind of car work, uh, try not
to, anyway.

A.17:  I try not to, uh,

B.18:  Yeah [laughter].  I can understand that.

A.19:  I suppose I ought to learn to change the oil and things.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  I could save a lot of money doing that.

B.22:  I can understand that, I, it's not the most fun in the world,
but, it, it, like you said, it is, it is cheaper on yourself to,
to go ahead and do it yourself than go spend fifty, sixty dollars
to have somebody else, you know, just change your oil or
something like that.

A.23:  I mean, it must be great to, to, to really understand what's,
what's going on.  You can both do things yourself and talk
confidently with people when you have to take it somewhere to
get --

B.24:  Yeah, yeah.

A.25:  -- parts or whatever.

B.26:  That's, uh, I think that's what my next option is if, if the
clutch doesn't work right to take it to somebody and see if they
can't decipher what the problem is.  I, I have a feeling maybe
it's just that I've, I've put too strong of a clutch in it,
because I've got, it's a, it's a straight six two hundred with a
three speed transmission in it, and I've tried to put a racing
clutch in it, which I think is going to, you know, I think that
may be what my problem is.  It's, it's too much clutch for the
amount of engine I've got, but, uh, we'll see.

A.27:  Was it easy to get --

B.28:  Pardon,

A.29:  -- a more appropriate clutch.

B.30:  Yeah, it's, it, I just drove to my neighborhood parts store
and get another one.  It's just, when I, when I had to re-,
engine rebuilt, I decided to try, um, a better clutch so that I'd
quit changing them out every six months.  I, I have a slight lead
foot.

A.31:  You have a slight,

B.32:  A slight lead foot, yes.  It means, it means I've always got
my foot in the gas and, and the other one in the clutch.  So I, I
burn up the clutch a lot.

A.33:  Oh.

B.34:  It's not good for it, but, uh,

A.35:  Uh,

B.36:  Any, any questions you have about, uh, anything easy to work
on over there, or are you trying to get yourself into working on
cars, or what?

A.37:  Well, the car I drive is an eighty-four --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- and it's reached the point where various things are, are
going wrong with it --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- and it's had to be in recently, it needed a new battery,
it wouldn't start --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- um, my wife and I did manage to, to, uh, recharge the
battery from the other car, um, and the exhaust system has needed
work --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- and, um, uh, so the, so, the latest work done it, just
yesterday, was to have the front wheels aligned --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- uh, so we've been spending,

B.48:  Don't, don't, don't tell me, let me guess.  Your warranty
just ran out and now everything goes wrong, right.

A.49:  Yes, 

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  in fact, in fact on the battery, uh, uh, it's the old one
that had a four year warranty, and the day it gave up was four
years and six days --

B.52:  Typical,

A.53:  -- uh,

B.54:  [Laughter] I, I, I don't know what it is.  Somehow or
another cars manufacturers and the manufacturers of new parts for
them, they put the warranties on there, and they know exactly
when they're going to run out, when the, when the part is going
to, is going to break down,
