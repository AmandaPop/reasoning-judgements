======================================================================

A.1:  I've, uh, [clicking] {telephone} are you there?

B.2:  Yes, sir, I'm right here.

A.3:  All right [laughter].  Okay, um, I'm in an area where, um, we
can, uh, enjoy it year round, so, I've actually been, uh, uh,
been out within the past couple of weeks.  I'm mainly a
freshwater fisherman.  How about yourself?

B.4:  Well, actually I've done both kinds --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- uh, I'm originally from the State of Virginia --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and, uh, lived near, near Virginia Beach where we could,
uh, surf cast and, uh --

A.9:  Did you ev-,

B.10:  -- catch a lot of things in the ocean there.

A.11:  Did you ever do the James River?

B.12:  I don't believe I have fished the James River.  There's a
possibility, but that was so long ago [laughter] --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- I moved here to, to State College, uh, in nineteen fifty-five --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh
water --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- and we have a lot of, uh, beautiful fresh water streams
that come through thi-, this area.  I'm in an area called Center
County, which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania,

A.19:  I've [throat_clearing] I've been in that area and the trout
fishing is supposed to be legendary.

B.20:  The trout fishing is really, uh, beautiful.  As I say, the,
the streams are, oh, eight, ten, fifteen feet wide and so forth,
and, uh, you, you stand on the edge and you, you cast out and
you, you work, uh, from your feet most of the time --

A.21:  Uh-huh, for brookies.

B.22:  -- and then there are, there are a few lakes of course, close
by,

A.23:  Yeah, what do you like, brookies or, uh, rainbows or,

B.24:  Well, tell you the truth, I'm, I'm not, uh, not picky.  I,
wherever the area, whatever the fish is the specialist in that
area, I, uh, I enjoy fishing for it, and I try to, I haven't
fished in several years --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- I'll have to admit, but when I do fish, I do contact, uh,
some of the local specialists --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- so that I can then find out the, uh, the type of lures
that they use and where they fish, and any unique, uh, techniques
that would help you.

A.29:  Do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?

B.30:  Uh, no, we, we fly fish.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  [Throat_clearing]  I used to do that a little when I lived up
in New York, but --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- right now it's, uh, uh, bass and striped bass is the only
thing that I go for down in Dal-, in, uh, Texas.

B.36:  Oh, that's a pretty big fish.

A.37:  Uh, yeah, they're, they've, uh, the striped bass have
accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes, and they're
pretty exciting when they're, when they're running.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  It's a salt water fish in fresh water, uh, environment.

B.40:  Well, our, our streams here are replanted with fish about
every year --

A.41:  It's all put and take.

B.42:  -- so that, well, they, they, they, uh, they have a pretty
good idea of, of, uh, what the number of fish are in these
various locations, and --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and they have [cough] have certain areas that they plant,
you know, a hundred here and a hundred there, and this is, of
course, X number of weeks or months before fishing season opens
so,

A.45:  What's the season?  April to Sep-, October or something like
that?

B.46:  That sounds about right --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- uh-huh, pretty close.

A.49:  Uh --

B.50:  You know. 

A.51:  -- what's a license cost?

B.52:  Well, as I say, it's been several years, but the licenses
weren't that expensive, I, seems to stick in my mind, five to
seven dollars --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- is about all, from what I remember it.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  It's about the same as Texas.

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  And I have, oh, probably a half a dozen different kinds
of, uh, fishing poles and, and fly rods and so forth, and, and I
had been so busy in my work in these last few years that I
haven't had time to fish.  But I'm going to be retiring at the
end of December, and I, I hope, uh, the next fishing season, that
I can sort of get back in and, uh, enjoy that.  That, that was a
really enjoyable, uh, thing for me to do.

A.59:  Well, I have all sons, so I think I'm probably going to be
fishing for a long time [laughter].

B.60:  Huh, I just have one son and he, he lives out of the state
now, rather, in the eastern corner of it, so, I don't think he
has time to fish either [laughter].

A.61:  I caught the disease from my father, and I'm passing it on to
my children.  It's really [laughter],

B.62:  Oh, is that right?

A.63:  They love it, yeah.

B.64:  Oh, my goodness. 

A.65:  Right.

B.66:  Well, I, I, the disease I caught was simply because, uh, I, I
was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area, and --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- people there, there's, there's so much water around --

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  -- that, you, you're either boating or you're fishing --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- and, uh, I fairly enjoyed at that time.  I have a small
aluminum boat here --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- that, uh, when I go on one of the large lakes that we have
here that I enjoy fishing for, for trout from that,

A.75:  Uh, uh, I don't, I don't know about the lakes in central
Pennsylvania.  Are there many? 

B.76:  [Throat_clearing]  Well, as I say, I'm in Center County. 
There's, um, there're two different size lakes about, well, five,
six miles from State College.

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  Now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- but they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- which, which here is a lot of water,
