B.1:  Hello.

A.2:  Hello, my name is, uh, Donna Donoghue and I'm calling from Plano, Texas.

B.3:  Yes, how you doing.

A.4:  Hi.

B.5:  Did you, uh, press one?

A.6:  Yes, I did.

@B.7:  Oh, just thought to get started.  I'm Phil.

A.8:  Okay, um, let's see, um, I enjoy watching the TODAY SHOW early in the
morning with my first cup of coffee, because everyone is still sleeping.  I
have three children, and I enjoy watching the news, because I probably don't
have as much time as I'd like to re-, sit and read the paper [laughter].  Um,

B.9:  [Laughter] [throat_clearing].

A.10:  what about yourself?

B.11:  I like, uh, I would like, probably like, I think I like the TODAY SHOW on
the rare [laughter] occasions I get to watch it.

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  I, uh, the first one comes to mind, uh, without a lot of thought is, uh,
THIRTY-SOMETHING, which of course is not on the air any more unfortunately
[laughter].

A.14:  Right.

B.15:  It was one of my favorite shows.

A.16:  Yeah, I enjoyed that too.  I guess, also, that was a nice one because it
was at a time when the kids are already in bed [laughter].

B.17:  [Laughter].

A.18:  Um, I,

B.19:  Uh, yeah, I was going to say, uh, I'LL FLY AWAY, which, uh, I think was
supposed to, uh, catch some of the same viewers is, uh, we've been --

A.20:  Uh, I haven't had a chance,

B.21:  -- trying to watch that.  It's, uh --

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  -- not quite as good.  I guess you got to get into it.

A.24:  Is it in, is it set in a different era?  Is it, um, was it in the fifties,
or in the si-, 

B.25:  Yeah, it's, uh, it's about civil rights struggle in the fifties.

A.26:  Oh, okay, I didn't, I've, I've seen the commercial for it, but it's not,
uh, seem to be on at a good time for me.  I try to stay away from horror
movies.  I just dislike them totally.

B.27:  Totally agree.

A.28:  Yeah, I don't, um,

B.29:  Oh, I say violence and horror, I think --

A.30:  Yeah, that's --

B.31:  -- [Laughter] lump them together.

A.32:  -- tha-, that's right, and, um, with young kids in the house, we just
really try to screen a lot of the things that they, they watch.  Um, we watch
a lot of SESAME STREET [laughter] --

B.33:  Yes.

A.34:  -- and a lot of P B S, and the, uh, Discover Channel --

B.35:  Yeah, that's --

A.36:  -- or Lifetime.

B.37:  -- fantastic, isn't it, that Discovery Channel.

A.38:  Yes, it is, it is, it is wonderful, and especially my eleven year old is
just fascinated by some of the, the things they have on there.  Um, what else?
I, my husband enjoys watching a lot of sports, which I really, um, don't
particularly enjoy but,

B.39:  [Laughter].

A.40:  [Laughter] they're, they're on there, I tolerate it.

B.41:  Well, I, uh, I like watching the Oilers and the, uh --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- that's about it, I guess.  I watch, that's about the only sports I
really like to get into on T V.

A.44:  Okay.  And, um, what else is, there's a lot of things that I just can't
believe is even on T V.  You watch it for two minutes and think, this is so
ridiculously --

B.45:  Yeah.

A.46:  -- stupid [laughter].

B.47:  Well, one of the good things is having cable, they, uh, they, uh, now, you
know, the choices are so, so good, and so, uh, vari-, variety there that you
can really.

A.48:  You can change it.  You know what is a good station, too, we subscribe to
the Disney channel.

B.49:  Oh, yeah, I think if my kids were small again we probably would, too, but,
uh.

A.50:  Yeah, it's, it's a really nice, and they have, um, you know, movies that
sometimes we'll sit and enjoy, and it's, it's really very nice, uh, that was,
we dropped, um, H B O because there was just never anything appropriate on for
the kids --

B.51:  Uh-huh.

A.52:  -- and now with renting videos so readily, I mean, you can just rent it if
you really want to see it that badly.

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  But.

B.55:  Well, that's kind of a toss up there, whether the inconvenience of renting
the video versus, uh, there never seemed to be anything good on when we want
to watch it, you know.

A.56:  That's right, and then, and then they repeat everything so often, too, and,
or if it's on at ten at night, well, I, I'm asleep by ten at night.

B.57:  [Laughter].

A.58:  I don't think I could stay up that late any more [laughter].

B.59:  Really.

A.60:  Um, not to start a movie anyway.

B.61:  Yeah, well, that's true, and, uh, of course they have the Pay Per View, but
our, our channel, uh, system here in Houston is, uh, is not noted for being
the greatest, you know --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- I think we kind of got the short end of the stick when our programming
came around, so.

A.64:  I see, I see.  

B.65:  They charge a lot, like four dollars and a half, or something like that per
--

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  -- per view.  It seems a little high.

A.68:  It does, it does seem high but, um, what other, there's a, I guess one or
two sitcoms, and the kids of course like to watch that new DINOSAUR show
that's --

B.69:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

A.70:  -- which is pretty silly, but, but they.

B.71:  We used to watch, uh, my kids would watch, my teenage kids would watch
that, uh, BART SIMPSON.  That was pretty good.

A.72:  Yeah, yeah, once in a while Bryan watched that.  But that is more for an
older kid than, than the younger ones --

B.73:  Yeah, they were teenagers.

A.74:  -- you know, so that seems okay for them.

B.75:  I like ROSEANNE, that's a coach. 

A.76:  I do too.

B.77:  [Laughter].

A.78:  I had to try to tell my kids that, you know, we don't really talk to each
other like that, I hope we don't any way,

B.79:  [Laughter].

A.80:  to make sure they don't think well, gee, Mom --

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  -- look what their kid just said.  Say, well, but, um, and the kids like to
watch that DOOGIE HOWSER, but, uh, even that sometimes I have to shut it off
and say, it's,

B.83:  [Laughter].

A.84:  an adult theme.  We don't need to watch that tonight --

B.85:  Yeah.

A.86:  -- we'll get out the Clue game or --

B.87:  Oh.

A.88:  -- or substitute Parcheesi or something.

B.89:  At least you're exercising a little control.
