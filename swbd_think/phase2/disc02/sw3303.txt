============================================================================

A.1:   Okay, you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team, or
who you think will be doing well this year.  

B.2:   Uh, well, where I'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a
very big conference and, course, we have Duke University that was
the national champions last year, so I'm kind of hoping that
they'll repeat again this year.  They have a lot of the same
players back.  

A.3:   Are we talking about, is this the N B A?  

B.4:   No, this is college -- 

A.5:   This is college,  

B.6:   -- basketball.  

A.7:   College, okay [laughter].  

B.8:   Right.  We have like Carolina, and Duke, and Georgia Tech, and
N C State, teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty.  

A.9:   Uh-huh.  

B.10:   So, hopefully we'll have a good year.  I don't really
[throat_clearing] follow the N B A very closely.  

A.11:   And see that's probably all, all I saw.  I, we have moved in
the last couple years from Utah to Texas and there's so many
[laughter] colleges and universities in Texas, we haven't really
followed them too much and none of them are our, our alma mater
[laughter], so, that seems to help.  

B.12:   Do you like professional basketball?  

A.13:   Uh, I, I follow it especially around the playoffs, so, course,
I was real familiar with the Utah Jazz, and the Mailman or Karl
Malone was, you know, pretty big thing and, the Lakers have always
been amazing to watch.  

B.14:   Yeah.  

A.15:   I, I did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks.  They've
not had any good seasons [laughter] for a long time, 

B.16:   [Cough].

A.17:   and have a lot of problems with, with Tarpley and, maybe
now that that's over they'll, they'll come out of it but,

B.18:   Well, that's an up and coming team, though.  

A.19:   Yeah, I hope they do something.  They need to or they're not
going to have [laughter] any of the team left at all.  

B.20:   That's somebody you can get behind and,

A.21:   [Throat_clearing]. 

B.22:   be patient.  

A.23:   Yeah.  Kind of like the Cowboys [laughter], I guess.  

B.24:   Yeah, they seem to be kind of not having a very good few
seasons.  

A.25:   Yeah, they, coming out of it this year.  We'll see if it's
held on.  

B.26:   But, I think Chicago will probably with the N B A again.  

A.27:   The Bulls?  

B.28:   Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.29:   Yeah.  They'll probably be pretty good.  Course, the Celtics
are always really, [throat_clearing] really good, too, with their
players.  

B.30:   That's true.  

A.31:   Be interesting to see how the Olympics does this year with all
the, the N B A players playing on the Olympic team.  

B.32:   That's true, it will be interesting.  

A.33:   So,  

B.34:   It will certainly be different [cough]. 

A.35:   Yeah.  I don't know,

B.36:   [Cough]. 

A.37:   how close I'll follow them, though.  And the season hasn't
started yet.  

B.38:   [Cough].

A.39:   I'm usually more the end of the season person, and we need to
talk about baseball [laughter] and so,    

B.40:   Yeah, oh, my Atlanta Braves. 

A.41:   Well,  

B.42:   Well, I really do, uh, you know, the basketball season's
supposed to start in the next couple of weeks.  

A.43:   It's, yeah, yeah.  

B.44:   It's a long season.  

A.45:   It is, it is, and that's why I've, I guess my mind went blank.
It's like last season was so long ago and I haven't really even
started thinking about basketball yet so,

B.46:   Yeah.  

@@A.47:   But, this wasn't a good subject, but,  

B.48:   It's a little early.  

A.49:   [Laughter] We'll see how our predictions come true.  

B.50:   We definitely will.  

A.51:   [Laughter] Okay, it's good talking to you.  

B.52:   Good to talk to you.  

A.53:   All righty, bye.  

B.54:   Bye-bye.
