=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay, who do you like?  [Laughter].

B.2:  Okay, [laughter] What kind do I like?  I like just about any kind except
country and western.

A.3:  Yeah, that's the same with me, same with me.

B.4:  It's, it's, course country and western even I've gotten a little bit used
to because it's not like it used to be.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Like Clint Black, he's pretty good, and who's the other big guy?

B.6:  Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks [laughter].

A.7:  Garth Brooks, yeah, that's, yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of
was Garth Brooks.  Yeah, in fact I think both of them have performed here.
And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, you know --

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  -- on the verge of country western.

B.10:  Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, uh, you know, his, his home town is
about, uh, fifteen minutes away --

A.11:  Oh, wonderful.

B.12:  -- so he is, he's a home boy [laughter].

A.13:  Well, then, of course you like him.  That's great.  But, well, I have teen
age children, and so, you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard
rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  He's my personal favorite.

B.16:  My son is, uh, twenty-eight, so, but he, he's real unusual in that, uh, he
likes a little bit of every kind.  He likes jazz --

A.17:  Oh, that's good.

B.18:  -- and, uh, blues and, and course the rock --

A.19:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.20:  -- I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.

A.21:  No, no, I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator
music at my house.  But I've got teenagers, so.

B.22:  Well, my teenagers are all gone.  I can listen to any music I want to
[laughter].

A.23:  Yeah, that's good, I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often,
but, uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music.  It's just
very wonderful.  Soothing, and, you know, uh, lot of symphonies and, I just, I
love that, that's probably my all-time favorite.

B.24:  You know, uh, I, I teach --

A.25:  Um.

B.26:  -- and we can have music in the classroom, but it, you know, it can't be
the rock or anything like that --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it
doesn't disturb them and --

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  -- yet it's, it's, it --

A.31:  Relax,

B.32:  -- stimulates them, and --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- and, uh,

A.35:  What do you teach, what grade?

B.36:  Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve --

A.37:  Good for you.  

B.38:  -- and,

A.39:  A certain subject?

B.40:  Well, it's, uh, business technology.

A.41:  Good for you.

B.42:  But, uh --

A.43:  I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller,
uh, I was reading my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our
junior college [laughter].

B.44:  -- oh, boy,

A.45:  Yeah, it's pretty good, it's just a real basic class, but we're learning a
lot, and we have a home computer, so it's, it's very interesting.

B.46:  Uh, yeah, I'd learn it too.  Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to
music, though.

A.47:  Yeah, the subject of music [Laughter].

B.48:  I, uh, do you play any instruments?

A.49:  I play, I play piano, I took lessons for thirteen years, and right now my
nine year old is taking piano, and I just got a whole mess of music, I, I play
the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the
whole grade school, which is K through six --

B.50:  Ooh, you took on a,

A.51:  -- five hundred kids.

B.52:  good job.

A.53:  [Laughter]  I did it last year, and, and, um, I, I just sub at the school,
I don't want to work full time, so I just sub at the school, and that's kind
of my volunteer thing, so that, it, it's really neat, and my older daughter
plays the saxophone, my next son plays the drums, and my third son just
started baritone this year, and my little girl will start French horn next
year, so.

B.54:  Oh, well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and
French horn.

A.55:  Oh.

B.56:  So.

A.57:  French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument.  It's just my favorite.  Of
course that's what I played, and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I
want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band --

B.58:  Oh, okay.

A.59:  -- once we get the, the French horn and I get a little bit more time.
Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.

B.60:  Yes,

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  sounds like you've got a houseful.

A.63:  I do, I do, I love it, but we have a, a marvelous band instructor, and, and
he's just, he's wonderful.  We have, uh, couple of hundred kids in the band,
our junior high band is just wonderful.

B.64:  Oh, that's a,

A.65:  He, lot, and their concert band, and then he has a jazz band that my older
daughter was in, and my son will be in next year that's, I mean, they ca-,
play college level music in junior high, he's that good of an instructor, and
the kids just love him.

B.66:  Oh, that's wonderful,

A.67:  So it's really good.  It is wonderful.

B.68:  I, I have totally, totally a tin ear --

A.69:  Oh do you [laughter].

B.70:  -- and I love music.  I cannot carry a tune in a basket.

A.71:  [Laughter].

B.72:  I know what I like, but I --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- you know, and I love to listen to it, love to sing, and I, my kids, when
I was little and, they were little and I was rocking them, singing to them.

A.75:  Uh-huh.
