========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, Kate, what kind of, uh, where do you like to eat out?

@B.2:  Well, we, uh, we really like the Mexican food, you know, here in Texas --

A.3:  Yes.

B.4:  -- and, uh, so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying
them out, and so, uh, Tia's is probably our favorite, uh, restaurant there,
and I think they have one of the best services that, uh, that we really like
it.

A.5:  Do you?  Have you tried Mother Mesquites?

B.6:  No.  Where's that at?

A.7:  That's at Skillman and L B J --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- there is, it's where Skillman, uh, curves into Forest Lane --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and it's real good Mexican food.  Another real good one is, uh, Rafael's
down on McKinney Avenue.

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  They're both very good.

B.14:  Really?

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Oh, that, uh, no, we haven't explored, uh, you know, too many places.  Um,
you know, lot of the big name brand, I guess, uh, chains --

A.17:  Chains, uh-huh.

B.18:  -- yeah, but, um, oh, we've tried places, you know, down, uh, by the Collin
Creek Mall, the, uh, you know, Alvarez, and, um, gosh we tried, what was
across the street, El Paso's --

A.19:  Oh, El Chico's or El Fenix --

B.20:  -- El Chico's or something, yeah, something --

A.21:  -- one, uh-huh

B.22:  -- something like that, uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.23:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, I like Tia's better than I do El Chico's or El
Fenix.

B.24:  Yeah, yeah.

A.25:  Uh, much better.  Uh, Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites but then
fajitas are one of my, uh, I like it better than just about anything --

B.26:  Oh, yes.

A.27:  -- and they make very good fajitas there --

B.28:  Yes.

A.29:  -- in their own, uh, homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely
wonderful.

B.30:  Oh.

A.31:  Especially with butter and honey on them [laughter].

B.32:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Oh, I know, I tell, I tell you what.  They are, they just,
um, they're excellent, uh, excellent food.  I wish I could make them here at
home.

A.33:  Yes, yes, so do I.

B.34:  Just can't make those flour tortillas.  But,

A.35:  Well, what else do you like?

B.36:  Well, I love, uh, I love seafood --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and I notice they have like the, you know, The Louisiana Purchase, um,
Razzoo's has opened up down, you know, off of, um, um, oh, close to six
thirty-five.

A.39:  Yes, now I haven't eaten there.  Have you eaten there?

B.40:  Yes.  I have eaten there.  Now the only problem, I love the food.  It's a
lot of cajun food and --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- good seafood, but, uh, the service has always been so strange, every
time I've been in there.  Mostly it's been at lunch time --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and, uh, but I hear at night though they have, uh, you know, the
outdoor, um, bar, and, um, uh, that's it's really, uh, you know, kind of
lively.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  So, it's, it's really good.  All their blackened grill stuff.

A.47:  Oh, I, we like, uh, uh, for the cajun, the spicy, we like Atchafalaya's out
on Belt Line, in Addison --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and it's a good restaurant.

B.50:  Oh, well that sounds great.

A.51:  And fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either 
Vincent's --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- there in Plano --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- or, uh, I believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on, uh, uh, Dallas 
Parkway --

B.56:  Huh.

A.57:  -- in Addison, which is absolutely wonderful.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  The service is great.  They have every kind of fish that you could imagine
you'd want --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- and the, the atmosphere is wonderful too.  If you want a really special
night out and fish food --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- that's a good place to go.

B.64:  Oh well, I, uh, I have children and, and work, and so we, uh, we can eat a
lot of fast food [laughter].

A.65:  Fast food, well, I can understand that.  I can remember when our children
were small.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  We lived in the Chicago area at the time, and we had a lot of McDonalds --

B.68:  Yeah [laughter].

A.69:  -- when they were first coming out.

B.70:  [Laughter] I know.

A.71:  I can't look a McDonalds in the face now.

B.72:  I, I know, I, I'm so sick of McDonalds,

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  and we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time.  And, so now
we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or [laughter] some other fast food
joint.

A.75:  [Laughter]  Well, Taco Bueno's good [laughter].

B.76:  Oh and, and cheap too.

A.77:  And cheap, and cheap.

B.78:  Yeah, but, but the kids, they've got those expensive tastes so, uh, they
like Tia's so they can sit down --

A.79:  Yes, yes --

B.80:  -- and all that good kind of stuff.

A.81:  -- yes.  Sounds like my grandchildren.

B.82:  Yeah, I know.  They, they, they're just spoiled rotten, but, uh,

A.83:  [Laughter].

B.84:  but, no, I, uh, uh, we love to eat out, of course, it's just so much easier
and simpler --

A.85:  Oh, yes.

B.86:  -- yeah.  So we, uh, we usually eat out generally two or three times a
week.

A.87:  Well, it's just my husband and I, and it's either T V dinners at home or we
go out to eat.

B.88:  Yeah, yeah.

A.89:  And I would much rather go out to eat than T V dinners [laughter].

B.90:  Oh, me too, me too.  So, I know, uh, I, I know that I, uh, you know, I just
work and I'm just tired when I get home and I, I just don't feel like cooking.

A.91:  Oh, no, no.

B.92:  And, uh, you know, on the weekends there's always things to do, and, uh, so
we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially.

A.93:  I like breakfast out.

B.94:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.95:  I like the IHOP there in Plano. 

B.96:  Yeah, now I, we've been there twice and, and both times I, just, oh, the
food just didn't quite settle with me --

A.97:  Oh.

B.98:  -- and I don't know what it was.

A.99:  Oh, now that's surprising --

B.100:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.101:  -- because normally they're just, they're real good.  

B.102:  Yes, and I love.

A.103:  I like because they, they're, even if they're crowded, they're fast
service, you know --

B.104:  Uh-huh.

A.105:  -- um, don't have to wait forever for a table.

B.106:  Uh-huh, yeah.

A.107:  And we also like Owens, uh --

B.108:  [Throat_clearing] Oh, family restaurant.

A.109:  -- country sausa-, yeah --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- yeah.  We think it's good.

B.112:  Now I haven't been there befo-, I went to one I think in Ohio or, or, or
somewhere up there, but I've never been to that one here.  I know it's just
down the street.

A.113:  Uh-huh.  It's good.

B.114:  So.  Now have you been to Applebee's.

A.115:  Yes, yes.

B.116:  Yes.

A.117:  And we like Applebee's.  

B.118:  Yes, I, I really like that too, so that was, uh. 

A.119:  Yeah, it, it's fun.  I like your, up there in Plano, that, uh, Country
Steak House.

B.120:  Oh.

A.121:  Have you tried it?

B.122:  I've been, I've been there twice, uh-huh, yeah, so.

A.123:  We like it because it's fairly reasonable and they have, we go for the
salad bar.

B.124:  Salad bar, yes.
