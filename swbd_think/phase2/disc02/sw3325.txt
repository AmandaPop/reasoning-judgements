A.1:  Okay, well, do you have a pet?

@B.2:  I have two cats.  

A.3:  Two cats, you're lucky.  

B.4:  And do, and, oh, and two fish.  

A.5:  [Laughter]  Your two fish.  

B.6:  And what do you have?  

A.7:  Well, my husband, you know, how, sometimes when you marry someone that you
get along on everything except one major thing.

B.8:  Oh, no.  

A.9:  My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who
had to have a sporting dog.  So we have a black Labrador.

B.10:  Ooh.  

A.11:  Beautiful, gorgeous black Labrador, but to me, he belongs up in the field,
you know, in the --

B.12:  Right.  

A.13:  -- ranch, in the farm and,  

B.14:  Does he sleep in your house?  

A.15:  Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he
sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day.  But this, this
is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he is, he's,
comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him,
except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person --

B.16:  Right.  

A.17:  -- that you could sit in the chair and cuddle.  

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  And this is huge.  You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just
digs, he doesn't know that he's tearing up things, but he does.

B.20:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.21:  And the worst part that I had with him, he's, he's three now --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- was when he was, uh, about eight months old and I did not know what to
expect from a dog having not had one, and I left him in the kitchen with the
little baby gates up while I was gone for about an hour.  And I came home and
he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall.

B.24:  Oh, my word.  

A.25:  And it was in the floor and I just about lost it and I called and I said,
come home and get your dog.  And so, he said, well, puppies just chew when
they're nervous and I, well, I wish you had told me --

B.26:  Oh, dear.  

A.27:  -- you know, and it was about eight months later, he ate a piece of the
linoleum.  He kept picking at it and I didn't kn-, the, the tile in the
kitchen and picked a hole in it [lipsmack].  So the last thing he did was,
when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard, and he dug them
all up and brought them to the porch.  And I told my husband, I said, you
know, it's either me or the dog, and he looked at me like, well, you know
[laughter].

B.28:  Good-bye [laughter].  

A.29:  He loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it
and talks to him and he's a good dog, so it's one of those things I'm just
having to get used to and that's why I laughed when they called with the
topic.  I thought, oh, boy, do I have a pet [laughter].

B.30:  [Sigh]. 

A.31:  But, I, I grew up with cats and I'm very comfortable,

B.32:  I love my cats.  

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  I had one cat for eighteen years.  I got her when I lived in Hawaii.

A.35:  Oh. 

B.36:  Before I even got married I had my cat.  

A.37:  She's old.  

B.38:  Well, she, I -- 

A.39:  Isn't she?  

B.40:  -- had to have her put to sleep last -- 

A.41:  Oh, I started to say -- 

B.42:  -- June.  

A.43:  -- then you broke your heart.  

B.44:  Oh, it was awful, it was just awful.  

A.45:  Oh. 

B.46:  But, and she just sat there on my lap, you know.  

A.47:  Oh. 

B.48:  She just, just waited and,  

A.49:  Bless your heart.  

B.50:  Oh, it was awful.  

A.51:  That makes me feel so bad.  

B.52:  But her hair, but the bad thing was, though, she would pee in my husband's
shoes.

A.53:  Yeah.  Oh, no [laughter].  

B.54:  You know, and she just liked his shoes and he'd have these dress sh-, --

A.55:  Oh.

B.56:  -- hundred dollar shoes. 

A.57:  Oh, no [laughter].  

B.58:  Oh, it was just bad.  

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  And my closet and it was, oh, something.  

A.61:  Oh, that's awful, I never heard of that before.  

B.62:  Oh, it was terrible.  And once she did it, you know, then she would, I
mean, she wouldn't, if our shoes sat side by side, she would pee in my
husband's shoes.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  She must have known he didn't like her or something.  

A.65:  [Laughter] Or the smell or something.  

B.66:  Oh, anyway, I, I, and I would shut, I would bar the closet doors,

A.67:  [Laughter]. 

B.68:  and would car-, vac-, uh, clean the carpets and -- 

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- oh, dear, it was just awful.  

A.71:  Well, d-, now, does -- 

B.72:  That was very funny.

A.73:  -- your cat sleep in the house?  They are, they are house cats.

B.74:  I, uh, well, I have two cats right now.

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  And, of course.  

A.77:  Oh, yeah, good.  

B.78:  They sleep with my kids.  My kids, my, my fourteen year old son has an
extra pillow on his bed --

A.79:  Oh.  

B.80:  -- just for the cat.  

A.81:  But the cat doesn't destruct does it?  See, it doesn't do anything.

B.82:  Oh, no, I -- 

A.83:  See.  

B.84:  -- I'm not going to have a dog.  We've had two dogs and, uh, they both got
ran over.

A.85:  Oh, no.  

B.86:  After we had them for several years, just nice little outside dogs but --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- were just my kids' friends, they would go jog-, they would go with me
when I would go running and --

A.89:  Oh. 

B.90:  -- and the last one got hit, uh, as she was following my, one of my sons
across the road to the school.

A.91:  Oh, no.  

B.92:  It was awful.  It was just,  

A.93:  Oh, that is.  

B.94:  And it just, it's too heartbreaking but they do dig up and they just, they
just wreck things and I'm not a --

A.95:  They do wreck things.  

B.96:  -- dog person.  

A.97:  Well, I'm not either.  

B.98:  Ooh.  

A.99:  [Throat_clearing] I'm not either and it's just been,  

B.100:  I wouldn't want a Lab.  It sounds beautiful,

A.101:  [Cough]. 

B.102:  but,  

A.103:  He's beautiful but it's just one of those concessions,  

B.104:  [Laughter]. 

A.105:  I just had to make, but I kind of ignore him.  Now today's the first cold
we've had in Texas and it's really cold and drizzly and it's freezing --

B.106:  Um.  

A.107:  -- and people are doing their fires and I brought him in because he's just
a wet mess out there and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet
square and he's just huddled up like, if you'll be nice to me, I won't make
[laughter] any trouble, you know.

B.108:  [Laughter]. 

A.109:  And then my daughters both have hamsters.  

B.110:  Oh. 

A.111:  And I, I,  

B.112:  And how old are your girls?  [Beep].  

A.113:  They're eleven and eight and I -- 

B.114:  Oh, yeah.  

A.115:  -- gave in at Christmas and they have, they keep their cages real clean.
It always smells of cedar and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and
carrots and,

B.116:  Sure.   

A.117:  {Pause} I think they're cutting us off.  

B.118:  No, that's -- 

A.119:  Oh. 

B.120:  -- somebody's trying to cut in on my line and I don't want to answer.

A.121:  Oh, okay.  

B.122:  I'll just wait.  

A.123:  Okay.  

B.124:  No, I've, I've got incoming calls and I don't know why, -body's calling.

A.125:  Oh, okay.  

B.126:  I, I hate to cut it off, I think -- 

A.127:  I understand.  

B.128:  -- they would cut us off, so we'll just wait.  

A.129:  Okay, well --

B.130:  Whoever it is will call back.

A.131:  -- they'll cut us off pretty soon.  

B.132:  Well, it's somebody calling for my kids, you know, jeez.  

A.133:  Yeah, I know.  

B.134:  Actually, it's my son, I know it is.  

A.135:  [Laughter]. 

B.136:  My older boy.  He never likes to come home from school.  Anyway that's what
we have, and I have, I've tried to start a fish tank --

A.137:  How does, 

B.138:  -- and I keep --

A.139:  In the salt water?

B.140:  -- losing all my fish. 

A.141:  Salt water or,   

B.142:  No -- 

A.143:  Yeah.  

B.144:  -- just regular water.
