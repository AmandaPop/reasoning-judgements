B.1:  So how many, um, credit cards do you have?

A.2:  Um, I think I'm down to one.

B.3:  Oh, my gosh, I wish I was that way.  Is that why you said I had more
experience than you?

A.4:  Well, no.  I was pulling your leg.

B.5:  Oh.  Well, how, how do you use your credit card?  I mean, do you just keep
it in reserve, or.

A.6:  I, I, well, the way I'd like to try and use it is, um, you, you, you make
your purchases at, at prime buying time --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- and then you pay that off and don't use it until, uh, it's paid off.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  That's, that's my ideal way [laughter].

B.11:  Uh-huh.  How, how do you use it?  [Laughter].

A.12:  Emergencies come along, and I --

B.13:  Yeah --

A.14:  -- and I use it.

B.15:  -- that's understandable, exactly.  

A.16:  Uh, like, uh, my car, uh, had a major problem, and --

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  -- seven hundred dollars, and --

B.19:  Right, right.

A.20:  -- uh, things just come up and you just never get to use it the way you'd
really like to.

B.21:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, actually I do have quite a few more credit cards
than you have [laughter].  Um, and I use them, you know, like my American
Express I use for, you know, gas, things like that, and I pay that off
monthly, and then, um, some other credit cards, like store credit cards, you
know, I do have them up there a little bit, but, uh.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  I try not to use them too often.  But living in this area, uh, like I live
fifteen miles west of Washington, D C --

A.24:  Um.

B.25:  -- it's a very expensive area [laughter].

A.26:  Yeah.

B.27:  So, sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something.

A.28:  Yeah. Well, I, I know I was up in there and a lot of credit cards, and I
was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble --

B.29:  Right.

A.30:  -- so we just disposed of them, paid them off, and --

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  -- got out of it.  I just.

B.33:  Uh-huh, well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that.

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  (( )).

B.37:  Now are you married, that you both, you and your wife use a credit card,
or?

A.38:  Yeah, yeah.

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  Well, now we pretty much just pay cash for --

B.41:  Uh-huh.  Um.

A.42:  -- as much as we can there.

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  Our, our only credit card is Sears, so --

B.45:  Uh-huh, um.

A.46:  -- and I have that for automotive purposes.

B.47:  Right, right.  Well, well that's great.  Um, everyone I know here uses, um,
credit cards like they're going out of business [laughter] --

A.48:  Yeah.

B.49:  -- to be honest with you.

A.50:  Yeah, it's, it's just too easy, basically, uh, just get yourself in trouble
with those.

B.51:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the only other one I have, I have like a Diner's Club
through my, um, where I work --

A.52:  I see.

B.53:  -- so that I use, because I travel some.  So I use that, and I don't really
have to worry about that, because I only use it for business, so I
automatically have the money to pay it off.

A.54:  Yeah.

B.55:  But.  Um.

A.56:  Uh, I wouldn't mind, uh, you know, getting back into one if they would, you
know, you start out at a low limit, and then they just keep wanting you to
increase your limit --

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  -- and, and if I can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- and I can never go over that or something --

B.61:  Uh-huh.

A.62:  -- like that, then that's fine, but they [inhaling] eventually get's up
there to five thousand, ten thousand, whatever --

B.63:  Uh-huh.

A.64:  -- fifty thousand [laughter] --

B.65:  Yeah.

A.66:  -- forget it, I don't want that.

B.67:  Um, [laughter] the temptation's too great.

A.68:  Yeah.

B.69:  Um.

A.70:  So, I don't know, just, uh, writing checks is just as easy I guess.

B.71:  Yeah, that's true, that's true, but.  So, I guess, uh, we've kind of
exhausted this, uh, topic [laughter].

A.72:  Yeah, well, really, what, what can you.

B.73:  Yeah, you can't say too much about it really.

A.74:  Other than, you use them or you don't use them.  You like them or you don't
like them.  So.

B.75:  Uh-huh.

A.76:  I guess, uh, they don't care if we end it early.  So, uh, hopefully, uh,
you have a good Thanksgiving.  That's coming up, and.

B.77:  Okay, you, too.

A.78:  And, then, uh, maybe we'll talk again.

B.79:  Yeah, may be, you're the furthest person, actually, that I've talked.  I've
talked to a lot of people in Texas.

A.80:  Yeah.

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  Texas is the big one.

B.83:  Yeah, so.

A.84:  [Laughter]  Okay, then.  Well, #bye now.#

B.85:  #O-,# okay, bye-bye.
