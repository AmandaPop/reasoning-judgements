======================================================================

A.1:  Well, what do you think?

B.2:  Well, um, gosh, it set up on a scale one to ten,

A.3:  Yeah, one being total, total, uh, restriction, and ten being none.  Well
I'm probably dead in the middle.

B.4:  Uh, you know, I, I think I would too.  I think I'd straddle the fence.

A.5:  Because my husband's a truck driver, #okay# --

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  -- and he travels a lot of states --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and I'm always thinking of New York and all of them.  Now they get New
York and California toget-, New York and Washington should I say --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- have the strictest gun control law there is, supposed to be --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and it, look what it done.  It's, it's nothing.  The people, more people
get killed in New York than in anywhere --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- from guns.

B.16:  Yeah, well.

A.17:  So the only people, the only thing that I think gun control does, to me, is
it keeps the normal people, or should I say law-abiding citizens, from having
guns --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- because the criminals going to --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- get their guns.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  It's not going to do any good to, now if they ban, like the automatic guns
and all that from --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25: -- period, then, you know, then if they catch them with one, then fine, but
just gun control ain't going to stop them from having a gun.

B.26:  Right, yeah.

A.27:  That, that doesn't, you know.

B.28:  Oh, well, I agree with you.  Uh, it seems like the, the crime rate has gone
up even more, um, here, this year, they're talking about, uh, there're more
murders in Dallas --

A.29:  Yes.

B.30:  -- um, almost since last year, and.

A.31:  Well, the guy that broke in the store, stole a bunch of guns and --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- because the owner didn't have a, a burglar alarm or something --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and to me that was stupid.  They should at least make him have an alarm
or --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- make it a requirement on them, on them gun stores, you would think
[laughter] it would be.

B.38:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  So, but yeah, I, I just, I wouldn't want to ban it completely --

A.41:  No.

B.42:  -- um, but, uh, somehow there needs to be, the one thing that I did like
was that where you had to wait seven days --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- um, you know, um.

A.45:  I don't mind waiting, that, that, that's, I could care less --

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  -- you know --

B.48:  Yeah, yeah --

A.49:  -- but.

B.50:  -- waiting seven days so that they can make sure that, check it out and
everything's okay, and, to me, that was, uh, that was perfectly acceptable --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- you know, because if, you are a law-abiding citizen, you're not going to
want to, you know, it's not going to matter to you if you have to wait a
little while.

A.53:  Uh-huh, and see, the, the, the thing about it to me that they was talking
about having gun control so people wouldn't kill anybody, but, I am a true
believer that if somebody wants to kill somebody, okay --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- I don't care, if they can't get a gun, they'll find something else.

B.56:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

A.57:  It doesn't matter that they, the only thing is is, a gun is the quickest
way they, they had or they had accessible to.

B.58:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.59:  But if they don't have a gun, they'll find something else, especially if
they want --

B.60:  Oh, yeah.

A.61:  -- or they'll wait --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- for those seven days because they're not crazy --

B.64:  Oh, yeah.

A.65:  -- yet, [laughter] I mean, you know --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- they haven't proved to nobody that they're crazy or they're in no
federal, no, no, no, uh, what do you call it, record or nothing, so they'll
get a gun, then they can go kill somebody, and then that'll be it.

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  [Laughter] And they still going to get it, so.

B.70:  Oh, I agree with you.  Yeah.

A.71:  I don't think the gun control is going to help as far as, you know, just
taking everybody's gun away, because Japan, well, is it Japan, one of those
foreign countries has gun control --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- but all the mob people have guns.

B.74:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I, I don't think that they should ban it, I re-, I
really don't.  Um, you know, I, I don't have a gun in the house myself because
I have, uh, children, and, uh, you know, feel really uncomfortable about that,
but, if I was by myself, I'd definitely have a gun.

A.75:  Well, I have a gun, you know, my -- 

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- well, my son's fifteen, but --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- my husband and me, he knows, he don't even touch it.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  It's not a hand gun, see --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- it's a shotgun, so, it just sits there --

B.84:  Okay.

A.85:  -- and it's in, it's in my bedroom, and he's not allowed in there anyway,
so.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  [Laughter].

B.88:  Yeah, so that,

A.89:  But it's not nothing that he can like, and that's another thing with these
kids with these guns --

B.90:  Oh, yeah.

A.91:  -- I blame more the parents, because, I grew up with guns, I guess, you
know --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- in the house.  My father had a gun cabinet.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  But we wasn't allowed to touch it, and Lord help us --

B.96:  Oh, yeah.

A.97:  -- if we did.  

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  [Laughter].

B.100:  But see these people I know they keep them up underneath their pillows --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- you know, sitting right on top of their dresser drawers --

A.103:  No.

B.104:  -- I mean, it's no wonder, you know, the kids get in there and then they
blow, uh, other people away, so.

A.105:  Yeah, little kids in the house, and I don't like the, I don't like it when
they have kids, little small kids --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- because when I have small kids over, I close my door --

B.108:  Oh, yeah.

A.109:  -- and my house is, I live, I live in an apartment, so --

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  -- you know, if the door opens I can see, like what are you going into my
room for.

B.112:  Oh, yeah.

A.113:  [Laughter].

B.114:  Yeah.

A.115:  It's not like a big house --

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  -- to where's I can't see if they go in my room.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  I'll know if they go in the room, because --

B.120:  Oh, yeah.

A.121:  -- there ain't but two bedrooms, so, it's all right there.

B.122:  Yeah, so that, um, yeah but that, that's about the biggest reason why I
just never, never, and, and I won't even let my, my son play with play guns
either --

A.123:  Yeah.

B.124:  -- you know, not even get that idea about, about them.

A.125:  I think the only gun my son has is part of the Nintendo [laughter].

B.126:  [Laughter] Yeah, there you go, there you go.

A.127:  You know, with the T V thingy.

B.128:  [Laughter] That's right.

A.129:  (( )).

B.130:  There you go.  Yeah me too.

A.131:  You know, I don't like that, I don't, this, this, I don't know, I just,
uh-huh.  But I don't think the gun control as far as, I guess I would probably
vote right in the middle, if this --

B.132:  Uh-huh.

A.133:  -- if there is a way to vote.
