=========================================================================

A.1:   kind of options do you have in your work?  

B.2:   Uh, as far as other than salary, like the fringe benefits?  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   Uh, [lipsmack] we get, of course, insurance paid.  We get
our sick leave and, and holidays paid.  Uh, you --

A.5:   That's nice.  

B.6:   -- earn vacation, and, uh, of course the work place is, is,
uh, very, uh, it's a very nice area to work in.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.

B.8:   Uh, how about you?  

A.9:   Well, we don't get much [laughter].  

B.10:   You don't?  

A.11:   No, we don't, uh, we have to pay for our own insurance.  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   And we, you know, we do get the vacation, but we don't get
sick pay until we've been there a year.  

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   And then, uh, I think it starts after four days.  

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   If you've been gone five consecutive days, then you get one
day of sick pay.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.  

A.19:   And, uh, uh, it's real tough --  

B.20:   The,  

A.21:   -- for benefits.  

B.22:   The sick leave is, according to the status, the way you're
employed, it has something to with the, the way you earn your sick
leave and, uh, you don't automatically get it.  

A.23:   Uh-huh.  

B.24:   Depends on your status.  

A.25:   Right.  

B.26:   Uh, but, uh, really can't complain.  Course, the cost of, uh,
living keeps going up, salaries remain about the same and your -- 

A.27:   That's -- 

B.28:   -- [laughter] medical -- 

A.29:   -- the truth.  

B.30:   -- benefits go up also.  

A.31:   Uh-huh.  If you can get some good medical benefits, it makes
a big difference.  

B.32:   It, it surely does.  Especially if you have a family.  

A.33:   Right.  

B.34:   I don't --

A.35:   And you don-, 

B.36:   -- but I know when you have children -- 

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   -- it can get to be quite expensive.  

A.39:   Yeah, I don't have any children, but I do have, my husband
gets, uh, insurance paid through his company.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   But it's still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job
than it is to get onto his.  

B.42:   Is that right?  

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   Gee, I -- 

A.45:   So,  

B.46:   -- I didn't realize that.  

A.47:   Until he's been there a little longer, then maybe I can, you
know, get into that.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   But, a little better.

B.50:   Uh-huh.

A.51:   But, uh,  

B.52:   Well, do you think, then, salary is the most important?  

A.53:   No.  

B.54:   Okay.  

A.55:   I really don't.  I really think that benefits, uh, help out
a lot.  

B.56:   Uh-huh.  

A.57:   You know, with the positions.  Uh, uh, benefits, you know,
like you said are, are almost better, you know, that's a lot of
pay.  If  you -- 

B.58:   That's true.  

A.59:   -- thought, if you think about health, because I think my
husband and I went to, uh, get health insurance from an outside
agency once -- 

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a 
month -- 

B.62:   Yes.  

A.63:   -- to get basic health insurance.  And if you think about that
[noise] on top of your pay, it makes a big difference.  

B.64:   I know that my parents recently retired, well, not recently,
maybe the last six, eight years.  

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:   And, uh, they had to, uh, buy a policy until something kicked
in at a certain age.  

A.67:   Uh-huh.  

B.68:   And they were paying an enormous amount of money per month -- 

A.69:   It is unbelievable.  

B.70:   -- in order to maintain.  It really is.  

A.71:   And then my mom and dad have that Blue, Blue Cross, Blue
Shield -- 

B.72:   Uh-huh.  

A.73:   -- and I think that goes up every month [laughter].  

B.74:   Oh, yeah.  

A.75:   That is just something else.  

B.76:   Uh-huh.  

A.77:   Because they're, you know, at the retirement age and -- 

B.78:   Right.  

A.79:   -- and that's something, too, that's just unbelievable.  

B.80:   I know some of the companies when you do retire, you're able
to carry forward your re-, your insurance benefits.  

A.81:   Oh, well, that would be great.  

B.82:   Wouldn't that be wonderful?  

A.83:   That would be nice [laughter].  

B.84:   [Throat_clearing].

A.85:   Yes, it would.  

B.86:   But, uh, I don't know, I don't know what else would there be,
besides your insurance and your holiday paid and,

A.87:   Uh, my husband gets, uh, life insurance, dental insurance and,
uh, life and dental and [breathing] health.  

B.88:   Yeah.  

A.89:   And then he also gets legal help, [noise] legal aid.  

B.90:   Oh, uh-huh.  

A.91:   And he also gets, like he's entered into a credit union and --

B.92:   Oh, yeah, we have that.  

A.93:   -- and, and all that, that kind of helps out [/noise].  

B.94:   Uh, now, that's true.  Now we've started the E A where you
can, uh, if you have like a mental health problem -- 

A.95:   Uh-huh.  

B.96:   -- or drug problem or what have you.  Uh, mentally they, they
will provide services for that now, too.  

A.97:   Well, that's nice.  

B.98:   And that's wonderful.  

A.99:   Uh-huh.  

B.100:   Uh,  

A.101:   My, my sister where she works has the H M O.  

B.102:   Oh, yes, uh-huh.  

A.103:   Which is something that's, you know, it's nice, but, you know,
it's great because you pay five dollars and you go -- 

B.104:   Uh-huh.  

A.105:   -- and, and your medicine is five dollars, but if it's not an
emergency, you wait three months [noise] -- 

B.106:   Is that right?  

A.107:   -- to get in.  Uh-huh --  

B.108:   Well,  

A.109:   -- that is, uh, trying to think which one that is, but I'm
not, it's a real popular one.  

B.110:   Um,  

A.111:   But, uh,  

B.112:   Is it like Cigna, or,  

A.113:   K-, Kaiser.  

B.114:   Kaiser.  

A.115:   Yes.  

B.116:   Well, we have that option at -- 

A.117:   Uh-huh.  

B.118:   -- at work, uh, to choose that or to stay with our, our
company -- 

A.119:   Uh-huh.  

B.120:   -- that, uh, T I has desired to administer the insurance
program.  

A.121:   Uh-huh.  

B.122:   But, uh, you can either go with the H M O, or stay with, with
Aetna.  

A.123:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, I, I'm going with Aetna.  

B.124:   That's what -- 

A.125:   Well,  

B.126:   -- I'm staying with.  

A.127:   I'm just going to stay with the, uh, you know, I can go to my
doctor, I think I pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and
that's it.  

B.128:   Uh-huh.  

A.129:   But, yeah, because she, you know, was trying to get into like
an eye doctor or something like that, and if it's not -- 

B.130:   Uh-huh.  

A.131:   -- an emergency, you wait for quite a while to get in.  

B.132:   Well, see, now, your eye doctor's paid for through the H M O? 

A.133:   Yes.  

B.134:   I-, ours isn't.  Well, I don't know about the H M O, but
through Aetna, it is not covered.  

A.135:   It's not.  

B.136:   No.  

A.137:   Yeah, my isn't either, but through the H M O, it is.  

B.138:   Oh, that's interesting.  

A.139:   And I think eyes, and about every doctor you could about,
