====================================================================

A.1:   Okay.  Have you been able to enjoy some family reunions in the
past that you'd like to discuss or,

B.2:   Um, yes.  I have a very large family.  I have seven brothers
and sisters.  

A.3:   Wow.  

B.4:   And [laughter] being, 

A.5:   #That's a, that's great.# 

B.6:   #next to the# youngest we all hav-, almost all are married and
all have children.  

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   So it's quite a feat to get everyone together but,

A.9:   I imagine it would be with seven, seven brothers and sisters. 

B.10:   [Laughter]. 

A.11:   #We,# 

B.12:   #Um,# [throat_clearing] what we did one year was for my
father's seventy-fifth birthday.  

A.13:   Oh, how nice.  

B.14:   We went out to dinner of course, and we had cake and champagne
and then we went back to his house and we re-enacted some of the
things we remembered him doing when he was, when we were little.  

A.15:   Oh, okay.  

B.16:   You know, like we always had to take off his shoes and socks
so, 

A.17:   #[Laughter].# 

B.18:   #you know,# one of us did that and -- 

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   -- and he used to tease us about, he would, he was going to
clean his shotgun out on the front porch when we were going to go
out on dates or -- 

A.21:   Uh-huh [laughter]. 

B.22:   -- he was going to threaten to kill the, um, Easter Bunny or, 

A.23:   #Oh, dear.# 

B.24:   #Santa Claus,# you know.  

A.25:   Oh, dear.  

B.26:   And so one of us dressed up and, and got the old shotgun and,
you know, of course, it was empty nobody uses it.  But, 

A.27:   #I hope s-, not [laughter].# 

B.28:   #brought that# upstairs [laughter] and, and so it was really
funny.  He really enjoyed it and, and all the rest of us did too
because we spent a couple hours talking about it afterwards and
adding more things we'd forgotten so.  #It was re-,#

A.29:   #Uh-huh.  I# bet he really enjoyed that.  

B.30:   Yeah, he did.  

A.31:   Well, that's fantastic.  That's fantastic.  

B.32:   And how about you?  

A.33:   Well, we, uh, we're all scattered around the country.  I have
a brother in Chicago, one in Cleveland, I have two in Germany, and
my sister.  We're from a large family also.  My sister is pretty
close to my parents.  And, uh, my wife and I luckily came from the
same hometown.  

B.34:   Oh.  

A.35:   And her, her family is scattered all over also.  So what we
try to do when we have family reunions, we schedule at the same
time every year.  

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   And we all kind of migrate back to where Mom and Dad are from
which is in, uh, northern Utah.  

B.38:   Uh-huh.  

A.39:   And so we kind of make sure that we schedule it the same time,
and we all head back about that same time and things that we do to
make it memorable are that we go to a, a resort either go water
skiing, horseback riding.  We make it a week long affair and, uh,
have a real nice vacation.  Another reunion we do is, uh, at
Christmas time.  This is something that, a tradition that my
grandparents started and we all get together around Christmas time
the first Satu-, the Saturday right before Christmas unless it's
either Christmas Eve or a day or two before.  And that's, uh, the
week prior to that and the, the amazing thing is we've had the same
Santa Claus and his wife have come for the last twenty-six years. 

B.40:   Oh, boy.  

A.41:   And so, you know, growing up as a kid that was always Santa
Claus and he was the same Santa Claus year after year after year,
and it really made a very, very pleasant and memorable and we all
exchanged gifts as, as family and, and we got to a point where we
were all gro-, growing up and we decided to have white elephant,
so.  

B.42:   Oh. 

A.43:   [Cough]  Excuse me.  

B.44:   [Laughter]. 

A.45:   I think one of the, the main thing is just being able to get
together and coordinate everyone's schedule that, uh, I find
somewhat frustrating and, [laughter] and hectic, but as long as
we've, uh, announced it ahead of time and sent out flyers and let
everyone know when we're going to get together and what we'll be
doing is, it's always been very, very fun and I've always enjoyed
it.  And, uh, we're very family oriented people and, uh, that, uh,
makes it more special or more interesting especially when you have
family from, you know, scattered all over the world.  Then you can
get together and discuss how their lives are and the,

B.46:   #[Barking].# 

A.47:   #different parts# of the country too.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   So, 

B.50:   Oh, I think that's wonderful.  My family is all over the
United States as well and we,  

A.51:   [Laughter]. 

B.52:   [Swallowing] are not as fortunate as to be able to get
together even once a year [barking]. 

A.53:   Uh-huh.  

B.54:   [Barking]  I, I moved here about eleven months ago and this is
the closest I've been to most of my family for years [barking]. 
I haven't seen my sister in Austin for five years.  

A.55:   Wow.  

B.56:   So, 

A.57:   Wow [laughter]. 

B.58:   [Throat_clearing] I know.  It's really awful because we were,
most, there are six girls and two boys in my family and so
naturally we got, then all got moved off somewhere [laughter]. 

A.59:   Yes.  Yes.  #Well w-,#  

B.60:   #I think it's# wonderful you get together once a year.  

A.61:   It's, it's not always easy but it's, it's very memorable. 
Boy, I bet that's hard because I imagine that as a large family you
were very close and, and, uh, had a lot of fun as family.  So, 

B.62:   Yes.  We really did.  We grew up on a farm and so you had to
play with each other because there was no [laughter], 

A.63:   #[Laughter].# 

B.64:   #one else around.#  

A.65:   Oh, yes.  

B.66:   So we played and fought and everything [laughter]. 

A.67:   So you got,
