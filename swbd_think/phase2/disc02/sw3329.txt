========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I think we can have honest government.  What do you think? 

B.2:  Well, I think there are honest people in our government.  I think it's, uh,
and we do have some checks and balances --

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- to keep it honest, but, I think it's always a real challenge to, uh,
make sure that we have people in there that we can count on --

A.5:  Yeah.  

B.6:  -- to be honest.  

A.7:  I've thought about the politicians that go in [noise], and, you know, they
say none of them are honest, but I think they are honest when they go in, they
just keep facing these challenges and not all of them respond favorably to
them.

B.8:  Yeah.  I think there are and have been some things that have been done to
maybe make things better.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  You know, one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to, uh, allow
certain donations --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- to, uh, be made because a, a lot of times, I think, you know, people
anybody that runs for a political office has got to either be independently
wealthy --

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  -- or they've got to be beholding to somebody to help them.  

A.15:  Yeah, some special interest group.  

B.16:  Yeah, and so, you know, I think if, if there were ways that we could get
away from that --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and let just the common man be able to run --

A.19:  And, 

B.20:  -- for office, that, that,  

A.21:  Yeah, and then, of course he runs into a problem he may not can support the
two homes and all of the other things even though they have a high salary.

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  But, uh, it's just, uh, I think public service was originally meant for
public service, but it, it's gotten to where it's kind of rather hard to do
[laughter] as public service, you know.  They need, uh, money to operate on
and this and that and feed their family, and put their kids in college just
like everybody else does.

B.24:  That's right.  

A.25:  And that puts stress.  

B.26:  Yeah.  Well, my husband has, uh, held public office for a while and --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- not a paid public office, I might add [laughter].  

A.29:  Oh. 

B.30:  And, uh,   

A.31:  That's public service [laughter].  

B.32:  Yeah, that's more public service, I guess, than public office and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- it's been a real eye-opener to us.  

A.35:  Uh.  

B.36:  Course, I feel that he's completely honest and -- 

A.37:  Yes.  

B.38:  -- what all and there have peop-, been people that have said, you know,
that they, how much is he being paid and all this kind of stuff to --

A.39:  Oh, yeah.  

B.40:  -- to do things, 

A.41:  You always have people throwing stones don't you.  

B.42:  Yeah, well, obviously if they ever looked at our house or [laughter], 

A.43:  [Laughter].

B.44:  our car or whatever, they would know he's not getting paid anything.

A.45:  Well -- 

B.46:  But, uh,  

A.47:  -- uh, I guess that, that, uh, it's, it's the way people perceive and they
perceive from their own wants, too, sometimes.

B.48:  Yeah, I think that's true.   

A.49:  Yeah, they want somebody else in so they've got to find something wrong
with whoever's there.

B.50:  Yeah, that's probably true, too.  

A.51:  Uh.  

B.52:  But, at the same time, you know, when I go to the polls to vote --

A.53:  Yes.  

B.54:  -- uh, I always am real nervous about who I'm voting for even if I have
studied the issues and heard --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- what people have had to say and everything because --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- [Breathing], uh, you don't really know that person.  

A.59:  No, you don't.  

B.60:  You know, and you don't know even if what they say is what they're going to
do and what their real feelings are on a lot of things.

A.61:  Well, sometimes they don't know that what they say is what they're going to
do.

B.62:  Absolutely.  

A.63:  Depends on the situation and that makes it very difficult.  

B.64:  Yeah, I guess that's a real problem, you know.  I, I, I don't know how we
solve that one, because --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- I'm not sure that you can ever, especially the, the higher up you go,
you know, like a senator or --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- Congressman or something like that, I don't know how you would ever get
to know any of those people well enough to say, you know, I know this man on a
personal basis --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- I know he has integrity and I know he --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- you know,  

A.73:  And to go by voting records and that isn't always right.  

B.74:  Yeah, or, just read the League of Women Voters -- 

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- answers that they give or,  

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  Yeah, so it's sometimes you just don't know.  

A.79:  No, I just, uh, kind of do the best you can, isn't it?   

B.80:  That's right.  

A.81:  Well, what do you think about, uh, uh, the legality or making it illegal to
do certain things.  Do you think that helps?

B.82:  Uh,  

A.83:  Calling them accountable from a, a law standpoint.  

B.84:  Well, that would be nice --

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  -- if we could do that.  

A.87:  Well, I know, uh, some of them, the Senate Ethics Committee is trying to do
that, but, uh, it's really strange [noise] that they find someone totally
guilty of something and then they go back and talk to their constituency, and
I'm thinking about one in particular [laughter].

B.88:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.89:  And, uh, then the constituency says, oh, well, he's honest and we want him,
you know.

B.90:  Oh, I can think of one like that also.  

A.91:  Yeah, I'm sure we both can.  

B.92:  [Laughter] Just blows your mind doesn't it.  

A.93:  Yeah, it sure does.  

B.94:  Oh. 

A.95:  And then they've proved that he's lined his pockets and everything else.

B.96:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  

A.97:  But, I,
