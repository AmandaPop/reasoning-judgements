=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, you want to tell me first how you feel about --

B.2:  Well --

A.3:  -- the proposal,

B.4:  -- um, I, I just think the way that things are going that, um, it would be
good for young people to go ahead and have, um, dedicate themselves to at
least something.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I know, like the Mormon religion, you know, they require two years of
service, uh, missionary service --

A.7:  The boys --

B.8:  -- right, the boys --

A.9:  -- not the girls, (( )) the boys.

B.10:  -- yeah, and, um, so, but I think it would be good for all young people --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- you know, to be able to, to do something like that --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- um, so that, um, you know, I don't know, I just feel it would be good
for them to do that.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  I, I thought it would be good, too, but I did not think it would
be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- because not all young people would have, uh, what it takes to go like
that --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- because I think it takes a certain person to, to be able to do something
like that, but there's a lot of other public service things --

B.20:  Oh, sure.

A.21:  -- that could be done.

B.22:  Oh, yeah, and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- um, public service things that they could do --

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  -- uh, you know, drug rehabilitation and --

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  -- and alcohol and, and just, uh, helping old people, and, um, uh, you
know, helping cripple, just helping somebody else --

A.29:  Yes, yeah.

B.30:  -- and I think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very
much any more.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I think it would be that.  When they say this proposal, is
this something that they're just suggesting, or are they actually, why, why,
why did they call it a proposal, that,

B.32:  Oh, I think they just gave it a title --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- in work some --

A.37:  That's what I wondered.

B.38:  -- yeah, no, no, it's not, it's just a, just a topic,

A.39:  It'd be good character builder.

B.40:  I think so, too.  I think so, too.  Um, because there's so many, um, kids
who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing
to do, um, and nothing to give their time to.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  Um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to, so I
think --

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  -- it would be really good for people to, um, to be able to give their time
in, in, uh, some kind of public service, uh, even in our government, you know,
as, uh, aids to, uh, you know, Congress, uh, people --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- so, um, yeah, it would be, it'd be really good --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- I think.

A.49:  Well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh,
some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public
service --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- activities --

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  -- which to me is, is good.

B.54:  Oh, yeah, oh yeah, I agree with you.  This is something that, um, like you
say, is it's character building --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- um, you know, learning how to, to give to others, and being less selfish
and,

A.57:  Well, I think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the
other people live like, you know, what --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- what some of the other parts of the world are like or --

B.60:  Right.

A.61:  -- even other parts of the neighborhood --

B.62:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

A.63:  -- some of the people, how they live or,

B.64:  Oh, I agree with you, I agree with you, and I think, uh, young people are
so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going
out with whom, et cetera --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- that, uh, you know, to get a taste of what the real world is actually
about --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- doing that public service would be great.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  Yeah, because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you
can't tell them how things are --

B.72:  Right.

A.73:  -- they have to see for themselves --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,
I don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done.

B.76:  Oh, yeah, I would think so, like right after, um, high school --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- you know, even if it was the, the, their, um, that summer right after
high school --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- you know, #three months,#

A.81:  #Of course# they've already gone through the period of time where they need
more direction --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  -- you know, they, their teenage years and that they really sometimes need
a little better direction to go --

B.84:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.85:  -- and something, course now Peace Corps, that couldn't be done of course,
until they were done with school --

B.86:  Right, right,

A.87:  -- so,

B.88:  You know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- yeah, but, yeah, you know, right, right after you graduate from, um,
high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, Well gee whiz, what do
I do now --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- if they're not focused on going to college, and, uh, you know, having
that, that, uh, gung ho plan --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- uh, that's, you know, setting their life goals.

A.95:  Kind of an in-between --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- time.

B.98:  Uh-huh, yeah, so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time
for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they
graduated from high school.

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  But as for its being required [laughter]  --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- you know, we're just not, we're not based on, on that, uh --

A.103:  Huh-uh.

B.104:  -- type of a system.  Um.

A.105:  No, and like I said, not, now all young people should be able to do
something, but --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- not all certainly would be geared to, even the, the Mormon boys that go
out, not all of them go, I mean --

B.108:  Right.

A.109:  -- it's disaster if they don't go, but --

B.110:  Oh, right.

A.111:  -- but some of them are not, they're just not made to do that type of thing
--

B.112:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.113:  -- and they just aren't able to do it.

B.114:  Yeah, yeah, so, um, yeah, it'd be good but like I said, requiring it would
be, uh,
