============================================================================

A.1:  What kind of car would you like to buy next?

B.2:  Well, I guess Cadillac.  I guess that's kind of everybody's dream
[laughter].

A.3:  Well, why would that be?

B.4:  Oh, I guess it's a General Motors product, and I like General Motors
because they're made in the United States, and, uh, we've had General Motors
for years and have always had real good luck with them.

A.5:  Okay, well that's good.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  If you had, uh, no financial requirements, if you could buy any car in the
entire world, no matter what it cost, what would you buy?

B.8:  Oh, um, I think I'd still go with the Cadillac.

A.9:  Do you?

B.10:  I don't, I don't care about a big fancy, fancy [laughter].

A.11:  Which type of Cadillac, uh, is your favorite?

B.12:  Oh, I don't know.  I guess the Seville, probably or.

A.13:  The Seville.  

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  That's a sharp looking car.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  That really is.  It, it always has been though.

B.18:  Yeah, they have been.

A.19:  You know, it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville
squareness.  It never really has.  It's always had it's own unique look.
 
B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Well, I've always liked [clicking] that.  I liked the, the one year they
had, a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles
across the back of it.

B.22:  Oh, yeah.  Right.

A.23:  I thought, now that looks sharp --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- that looks real sharp.

B.26:  Well, I think the ones now with all of the, uh, fancy gold lettering --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and all, you know, I think they're very pretty.  And course the top, now
the vin-, what is it, a vinyl top, I think those are pretty.

A.29:  Yeah, and, uh, the, I, I've never really, uh, I've never ridden in one
recently, um, but they're supposed to be just real smooth.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Just a nice comfortable ride.

B.32:  Yeah, they are, and, uh, they, they're just always, they, they look like
they're sturdy --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- you know, they look like they're very sturdy, and [lipsmack] you don't
have to worry that much about, [throat_clearing] um, getting, you know, hurt
like you would in a small one.

A.35:  Right.  Now they've got a unique fa-, uh, feature in them now.  If, uh, if
you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed, the e-, the engine will
actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the, so it
doesn't go, it doesn't go through the, you know, into the inside.  It'll go
underneath the car instead.

B.36:  Oh, I didn't know that.

A.37:  So that's, that's a big safety factor they've got in them now.

B.38:  Yeah, and I suppose they all have the balloons.

A.39:  The air bags, yeah.

B.40:  The air bags, yeah.  Well.

A.41:  So, well that's great, that's great,

B.42:  Yeah, yeah.

A.43:  So you say you've always have preferred General Motors products (( )).

B.44:  Yeah, I do.  Um, I, I go for things, you know, built in the United States
rather than foreign countries.

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  Help our economy and,

A.47:  What kind of, uh, [throat_clearing] General Motors cars have
you had in the past?

B.48:  Mostly Oldsmobiles.

A.49:  Oldsmobiles.  Those are real nice riding cars too.

B.50:  Oh, yeah.  That's what we have now, but of course if I have a choice I'd
still have the Cadillac but, uh,

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  I've been very satisfied with the, with the Oldsmobiles.  We've driven them
for about probably twenty years.

A.53:  Has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra?

B.54:  Uh, no, the Ninety-Eight.  

A.55:  The Ninety-Eight, okay.

B.56:  Uh-huh, yeah.  So.

A.57:  Well, I don't think, uh, let's see, the Ninety-Eight, now that's got that
big V eight engine in it, doesn't it, doesn't it?

B.58:  Well I don't know.  The one we have has a six.

A.59:  Has a little V Six?

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  Okay.

B.62:  But it's a very good car.  It's a --

A.63:  It,

B.64:  -- had, not had one minute's problem with it, and I've had, now I have
twenty-three thousand miles on it.

A.65:  Oh, that's great --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- that's great.  That's always nice to get, uh, reliability in a product.
Especially when you're spending, you know, anywhere from fifteen to
twenty-five thousand dollars for, for a single item.

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  You know, you just don't want any hassles --

B.70:  No.

A.71:  -- with it.  You just, you expect it to do its, its job, and I think a lot
of, a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consider-, don't
take that into consideration --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- you know.

B.74:  Yeah, that's true.

A.75:  They just expect you to buy their product, but that's always been something
that's been a key factor in me, is how reliable is this car going to be --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- you know.  Price is, is an issue, but it's not the most important issue.

B.78:  No, it really isn't, because now you can get like five year financing on
them and --

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  -- so, um, but I, I, I would go with the General Motors any time.

A.81:  Well, I've always been a Ford man, myself.

B.82:  Oh, really.

A.83:  Yes.

B.84:  Oh.

A.85:  But that's all right.

B.86:  Yeah, well sure.

A.87:  You know, it's American made too --

B.88:  Right.

A.89:  -- which is good.

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  Um, but I, I've, ever since I guess I, I was growing up, my dad's always
had Fords, and, uh, well, I grew up in South Dakota.  So everybody has a truck
--

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- and my Ford trucks have just, I've, I've just never had problems with
them.

B.94:  Uh-huh.

A.95:  I honestly think I would die before my truck would,

B.96:  [Laughter].

A.97:  keel over on me.

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  So.

B.100:  Well, I, yeah, those are good products also.  Um, let's see,
