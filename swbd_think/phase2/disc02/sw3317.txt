A.1:   Okay, what kind of house do you live in?  

@B.2:   Well, uh, we live in a, a brick home in far north Dallas and
it's, uh, four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming
pool in the back and,   

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   It's about thirty-five hundred square feet.  

A.5:   Well, it sounds like ours are pretty similar.  I live in one,
I don't have a swimming pool.  And mine's about twenty-seven
hundred square foot.  

B.6:   Yeah.  

A.7:   But the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about
[laughter], about alike.  I think it's pretty much typical for this
area.  

B.8:   It is.  Have you been living there very long?  

A.9:   I've been in the house I'm in here right now about twelve and
a half years.  

B.10:   So you've been there longer.  We built this one about, uh,
it's been [breathing], let's see [sniffing], it's been six 
years -- 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   -- six and a half years ago, and we subcontracted it out
ourselves.  We bought -- 

A.13:   Oh, really?  

B.14:   -- the lot and, uh, had an architect draw the plans based on
our specifications -- 

A.15:   Uh-huh.  

B.16:   -- and then we subbed it out, so, we've been here a little
over six years now.  And -- 

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   -- uh, have really enjoyed it because -- 

A.19:   Well, I bet you,   

B.20:   -- we built what we wanted to have to live in.  

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   My husband got his big garage.  He ha-, we have a three car
garage, that he has a big work area in -- 

A.23:   Uh-huh.  

B.24:   -- and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and, so he
has all the work space he needs.  

A.25:   Well, that sounds interesting.  I bet he's enjoyed having it
that way --

B.26:   He, 

A.27:   -- because some-, kind of hard to find one prebuilt that's
kind of fits those specifications.  

B.28:   It is, and that's why we decided to build.  We looked -- 

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   -- at things that were already, uh, built and the garages were
always, if the house w-, was large, it seemed like the garages were
small even if they were three car garages which is -- 

A.31:   Well, then, most -- 

B.32:   -- what we have.  

A.33:   -- of them don't have a three car garage.  

B.34:   Uh-huh.  

A.35:   They're kind of rare.  

B.36:   So we put a three car garage in.  

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   But, even if they had three car garages, they didn't have a
work space.  All of it was taken up with just car space.  

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   And so he has a big [noise] landing area that's between where
the cars are in the garage and where the house starts -- 

A.41:   Uh-huh.  

B.42:   -- that he can work on.  

A.43:   Well that, my, we've just got a two car garage, but my
husband's got a big space in between the, where the cars are and
the house, where he has a big work shop, you know, workbench and
everything.  

B.44:   Well, sounds like our husbands have similar interests.  

A.45:   Now, mine does not work on cars, he just piddles on this and
that.  

B.46:   Oh, I see.  

A.47:   But he likes to have a spot to keep all of his, his piddling
things.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   [Laughter]. 

B.50:   Well, that's nice that it's not in your house.  

A.51:   It really is.  

B.52:   Uh-huh.  

A.53:   Because, you know, they have a lot of things of their own, and
I, you know, I wouldn't mind having, and I at one time was going
to fix up when one of my daughters left, a bedroom to where I had
a room to just put all of my craft stuff and -- 

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   -- sewing machine and all that kind of stuff, [lipsmack]
but I, someone, I don't know, it ended up I got some furniture back
that one of them had moved out [laughter] or something.  

B.56:   Right.  

A.57:   So I didn't end up with my vacant room like I had thought I
would.  

B.58:   Well, we still have a, a son and daughter in college that come
home.  

A.59:   Uh-huh.  

B.60:   And the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my
husband's family [noise] come.  His parents come and also the kids
have friends who come -- 

A.61:   Uh-huh.  

B.62:   -- and stay and so -- 

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   -- it seems like it's always used as a bedroom.  

A.65:   Well, I still, all three of my daughters are married, but, I
don't know, I just still have need for the four bedrooms just
having company from time to time.  

B.66:   Right.  

A.67:   And some of them coming back home and things, you know.  

B.68:   Oh, I understand {faint}.  

A.69:   And we've got grandchildren now, so -- 

B.70:   Well, we,  

A.71:   -- when they come, they have to have a place.  

B.72:   [Laughter] That's true and you don't want them to not be able
to come because there's no room.  

A.73:   That's right, you sure don't.  At times I keep thinking,
though, that might be kind of nice.  

B.74:   Well,

A.75:   [Laughter]. 

B.76:   I c-, I haven't reached that point yet.  I've heard people
say that.  

A.77:   [Laughter].

B.78:   But, uh, my middle son is engaged, my oldest son has been
going with the same girl for a while.  

A.79:   Uh-huh.  

B.80:   He's out of college -- 

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   -- and has a good job, so he could afford to get married -- 

A.83:   Uh-huh.  

B.84:   -- but, is not engaged yet, and my daughter's been going with
the same boy for a while, but she's still in college and we're just
as happy for her to finish -- 

A.85:   Uh-huh.  

B.86:   -- her education first.  That's -- 

A.87:   Well, I don't blame you for that.  

B.88:   -- what she plans to do.  So, I hope so.  

A.89:   Well, I have the three girls and then we ended up with four
grandsons.  

B.90:   Oh, ho-ho.  

A.91:   And little boys are around the house -- 

B.92:   A whole new world.  

A.93:   -- a whole lot more than girls.  

B.94:   Uh-huh.  

A.95:   And, uh, I enjoy them coming, but for short doses [laughter]. 

B.96:   I can understand.  

A.97:   It feels, after they've been here ten minutes, they have
already explored the entire house, they know everything.  

B.98:   Uh-huh.  

A.99:   But, they're fun.  

B.100:   So you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine
yards or either watching them every minute.  

A.101:   Well, I just watch them.  

B.102:   Yeah.  

A.103:   I d-, I never did put things up when my kids were little and
I haven't with them.  I try to teach them not to get into things. 

B.104:   Well, that's the same thing that I did.  I hope I'll be able
to do the same with [laughter] grandchildren.

A.105:   [Laughter] I think that once you do that, your children kind
of develop the same attitudes.  At least my daughters have.  They
try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put
everything up.  So it's worked pretty well.  There's, I don't
really think anything's been broken.  Every now and then we have
to kind of go and say, now don't bother this [laughter], you know. 

B.106:   Um, uh-huh {faint}.

A.107:   But, all in all, they mind pretty well.  But, I guess most of
the hou-, d-, what kind of roof does your house have?  Here I'm
getting off the subject.  

B.108:   Well, we have,
