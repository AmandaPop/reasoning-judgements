@B.4:  Yes, I have a dog and cat now.

A.5:  Oh, what are their names?

B.6:  Tibby and Liberty.

A.7:  Which is the dog and which is the cat?

B.8:  Tibby is the dog and Liberty is the cat.

A.9:  Uh, wife and I, we have, we have two cats. 

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  Uh, one's real nice, but the other one is a, well, she's pretty wild.

B.12:  Oh [laughter].  Ours are pretty calm.

A.13:  Yeah, are they, um, just house pets?

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Yeah, that's, that's what ours are too.

B.16:  Yeah.  Our cat we got from the pound the day bef-, the night she was going
to be put to sleep.  So --

A.17:  Oh, really.

B.18:  -- that's why we call her Liberty.

A.19:  Oh, well, that's a nice, nice story.  Um.

B.20:  Do you want to hear about my other animals I've had?

A.21:  Sure, sure.

B.22:  I've had a skunk --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- I've had a Burmese python, I've had rats, I've had mice --

A.25:  Wow.

B.26:  -- uh, let's see, I've had gerbils, I have, I had a son, he's now gone from
the home, that was an animal lover.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  So at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the
house.

A.29:  Wow.

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  Um, do the skunk, uh, was it kind of like a cat to have around the house?

B.32:  Yes --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- it was litter trained --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- and we had it perfumed --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- and, uh, it was very aggressive.

A.39:  Right.   

B.40:  But all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each
other all through the house.

A.41:  Uh-huh, and the skunk.

B.42:  And the only thing we have with the skunk, he was very, very protective of
his territory --

A.43:  Oh, yeah.

B.44:  -- being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa. 

A.45:  Um.

B.46:  Nobody came near it when he was there.

A.47:  Oh.  Uh, I had, I had a dog one time, and, uh, he chased after a, after a
skunk and got sprayed --

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  -- so we had to, we had to give him a tomato, tomato juice bath, and, uh,
get him cleaned up,

B.50:  Yeah, they um, ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad
and try to perfume them, but --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- the glands had been removed so,

A.53:  Right, but I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to --

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  -- to back up and get ready.

B.56:  One other question we had is, Why do you have pets?

A.57:  Yeah, why, I don't know, I, I think they're kind of nice to have, they're
kind of, you know, just relaxing to, I don't know, to pet and to, I don't
know, when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that, just kind of
enjoyable to, you know, have like, I don't know, something giving you some
affection as well.

B.58:  Yeah, I always said if I di-,

A.59:  What, what do you think?

B.60:  Well, I always said if I died I'd come back as a dog [laughter].

A.61:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

B.62:  That'd be the best way to be.

A.63:  Yeah.  Um, do you like big dogs or --

B.64:  Well --

A.65:  -- or little dogs?

B.66:  -- we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to
lift him and carry him every place he went.

A.69:  Really.

B.70:  So, when he died, we got a little one.

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  But our shepherd was almost thirteen years old, and it just, you know, was
almost cruel --

A.73:  Uh-huh --

B.74:  -- because,

A.75:  -- almost cruel for him to, to walk.

B.76:  Yeah, he just, he couldn't get up, he couldn't walk, so, he was a hundred
and twenty pounds, so it was a chore.

A.77:  Wow, yeah.

B.78:  So we said the next time around we'd get [laughter] something little that
if --

A.79:  Sure.

B.80:  -- something happened, it would be easier to carry.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  And then we've had three cats in our married life, and we've got a calico
now.

A.83:  Yeah, we've got a calico cat too.

B.84:  Do you?

A.85:  Yeah, yeah, she's the, she's the nice one.  We, uh, we used to live in an
apartment and like, our cats never went outside, but, um, the neighbors used
to let their dogs out, and our neighbors were, I don't know, kind of slimy,
and, uh, our cats wound up getting fleas, uh, from the apartment that we were
in --

B.86:  Um.

A.87:  -- so, we had to, we had to flea bath them and it was, uh, it was an
experience that they didn't enjoy at all.

B.88:  Yeah, well, don't even talk to me, I, when I was single --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- I had gone away for the weekend, and my husband, then fianc3e, was to
keep my cat, and he let her out, and my house was loaded with fleas, I mean,
you walked in and your legs were just black.

A.91:  Really.

B.92:  And we had such a time, and never got the cat back.

A.93:  Really.

B.94:  Yeah, I found it, you know, in the street.
