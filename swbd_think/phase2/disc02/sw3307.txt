=====================================================================

A.1:   Uh, I kept a monthly budget for so long, I don't have one now
[laughter],

B.2:   [Laughter]. 

A.3:   but I sort know where it is.  I know where my expenses are
and how much I have to cover them.  How about you?  

B.4:   Well, I don't have anything, uh, a budget written down per se,
but, however, I, I know exactly where my money goes for the most
part as far as expenses, yes.  

A.5:   Uh-huh.  

B.6:   Uh-huh.  

A.7:   Yeah.  

B.8:   [Lipsmack]. 

A.9:   Do, d-,  

B.10:   I think in this day and time we need something like that,
don't we?  

A.11:   Yes.  I keep hearing that we're supposed to pay ourselves
first and set aside our savings first.  Are you, are you able to
do that?  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   That helps, doesn't it?  

B.14:   Yes, it does.  

A.15:   Back when we were, I'm, I take it you may be past raising a
family, is that true?  

B.16:   Yes.  

A.17:   That, back in those other days, we couldn't do that, could 
we? 

B.18:   No, other things came, took priority.  

A.19:   Like doctor bills [laughter] and things like that.  

B.20:   Uh-huh, that's for sure.  

A.21:   Yeah.  Uh, are you planning ahead for retirement through your,
your, uh, savings and things?  

B.22:   Yes, you know, that's interesting because I was talking at
someone in the office just this morning about the retirement and
what we would like to have when we retire and how we're going to
get there.  

A.23:   Yes.  

B.24:   [Breathing] It's really hard to anticipate in advance what
you think you're going to need, okay, and then try and plan now. 

A.25:   Uh-huh.  

B.26:   Because things come up.  

A.27:   Uh-huh.  

B.28:   But, I think now we're at the age where it's really very
important.  

A.29:   Well, one of the things that -- 

B.30:   You know.  

A.31:   -- my husband has, he, he works with financial things and, uh,
he's been trying to, he keeps saying, well, we need to sit and find
out how much we want and, and I think that's true.  But, like you
said, it's hard to do.  

B.32:   Uh-huh.  

A.33:   One of the things that we've done towards that is, uh, buy
nursing home insurance.  Have you all thought of that?  

B.34:   Oh, no, I hadn't even thought about that.  We have investments
to, uh, alleviate some of the cost of our old age --

A.35:   Uh-huh.

B.36:   -- hopefully in, in terms of, uh, an apartment complex.  

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   We've been partnership with, uh -- 

A.39:   Oh, that's sounds,   

B.40:   -- some other people.  

A.41:   That sounds good.  

B.42:   But, it's not going to provide a whole bunch of money.  I
mean, it might --

A.43:   Uh-huh.

B.44:   -- might pay the utilities.  

A.45:   Uh-huh.  

B.46:   You know, at, at that point in time.  Uh, and, hopefully, our
investments with T I will help our retire-, our retirement years. 

A.47:   Well the, uh, if you have, the retirement fund at place like
that, they're usually fairly good.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   I know mine, I'm, we've gone through some mergers and my
retirement has, has ended, uh, the plan has ended three different
times this year [laughter].  

B.50:   Is that right?  

A.51:   So [laughter],  

B.52:   That's not very encouraging, is it?  

A.53:   No, because, uh, of the changes that came about in the
government requirements, and then in, uh, in merger requirements. 

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   But, uh, my husband was looking into the nursing home
insurance.  Is, it's, it's really is an investment you hope you
never have you use.  But, uh, you have to be so careful of what it
will pay and what it won't pay.  

B.56:   When you buy something like that in advance, how can you be
sure that, well, I guess you don't really buy into the nursing
home, do you?  

A.57:   Oh, no, no -- 

B.58:   You buy,  

A.59:   -- it's an insurance policy.  

B.60:   It's a policy --

A.61:   Uh-huh.

B.62:   -- that will pay for your nursing home, should you need it? 

A.63:   It pays a set amount.  

B.64:   [Throat_clearing] Huh.  

A.65:   And, uh, and you talk to your insurance agent about, there's
special companies now that are doing it -- 

B.66:   Uh-huh.  

A.67:   -- and they set them up.  I know ours is a set amount each
year and it has a maximum amount over a thirty month period and,
uh, it, you know, it has, you need to read the policy -- 

B.68:   Uh-huh.  

A.69:   -- and look into what it covers.  I guess I'm conscious of
that because my mother's in a nursing home.  

B.70:   [Throat_clearing]. 

A.71:   And, uh, I think we, we learn from our experiences.  

B.72:   Oh, I think that's very true and that brings it more to home
when it happens close to home.  

A.73:   Yeah, it does. 

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   But, uh, I think one of the main things that we, in the past,
always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for
when we do retire.  

B.76:   Uh-huh.  And if you got that covered, [throat_clearing] I want
to travel personally and I want to be able to get around [laughter].  

A.77:   Oh, yes, oh, yes.  

B.78:   Don't we all, right?  

A.79:   At least two, three trips including a cruise every year [laughter].  

B.80:   At least. 

A.81:   At least.  

B.82:   At least.  

A.83:   You know.  

B.84:   [Throat_clearing] Well, it sounds like we have some good plans
anyway.  

A.85:   It sounds like we do.  

B.86:   Uh-huh.  

A.87:   And, uh, you're, you're leaning more towards investments and
things like that to do yours, then?  

B.88:   Right.  I don't know how sound that is.  Perhaps your way is,
is a, is a more sound proposition, you know [sniffing].  

A.89:   Well, we do that, too.  

B.90:   Uh-huh.

A.91:   You know, you can't, then the insurance policies are just
things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things.  

B.92:   Uh-huh, and that will always happen.  

A.93:   Oh, yes.  But, uh, the investments are something that you have
to plan for and get your, there was some new things,
