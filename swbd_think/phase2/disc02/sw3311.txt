REMARKS:        Speakers sounded similar a lot of the time.  It was
especially hard to differentiate when they spoke over each other.

=====================================================================

A.1:  All right, uh, well, [laughter] let's see,  

B.2:  How old are you Lisa?  

A.3:  I'm twenty.  

B.4:  Okay.  

A.5:  How old are you?  

B.6:  I'm older.  

A.7:  Older [laughter].  

B.8:  Older than you are.  

A.9:  Okay.  

B.10:  Okay, we are supposed to talk about places we like to go.  So I'm going,
and where are you from, where are you calling from?

A.11:  I'm calling from, uh, Provo, Utah, but I'm from Plano, Texas. 

B.12:  Oh, you are from Plano.  My sister lives in Plano.  

A.13:  Oh, really?  

B.14:  Yes, her husband is the new Director of Admissions at, uh, University of
Texas at Dallas.

A.15:  Oh, wow.  

B.16:  Yeah, so,  

A.17:  My dad used to work at U T D also.  

B.18:  Anyway, so, where's your favorite place to go?

@A.19:  Uh, generally we just go on family vacations to Arizona.  My grandparents
live there.  That's generally our usual summer vacation.

B.20:  Where in Arizona?  

A.21:  Uh, Tempe.  

B.22:  Okay, I've never been to Tempe.  

A.23:  [Lipsmack] So,  

B.24:  That's where I'd like to go.  What do you like about Tempe? 

A.25:  Uh, mainly just being with family is it.  We just hang out and my
grandparents have a pool so we go swimming and, uh,

B.26:  Pretty hot isn't it, in the summer?  

A.27:  Yeah but we keep cool just by going swimming and it's fun to be with my
cousins.  They're up there also, my grandparents and --

B.28:  That's good.

A.29:  -- my cousins.  

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  So,  

B.32:  Been to Hawaii?  

A.33:  No, have you?  

B.34:  [Breathing] Yes, in fact, I just got some reservations.  I'm going to
go for, uh, almost two weeks this winter.

A.35:  Oh, my goodness.  

B.36:  Yes.  It's the longest, well actually I lived there, so I was there longer,
but two weeks is the longest vacation I'll have ever taken there, so --

A.37:  Wow.  

B.38:  -- I'm kind of looking forward to that one.  

A.39:  Around Christmas time?  

B.40:  Uh, no, in March.  

A.41:  Oh. 

B.42:  We're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that
business out of the way.

A.43:  Wow.  

B.44:  Yeah, so I think, I would like to go to Arizona.  I mean, I was in Phoenix
in January, last January but it was rainy and icky.

A.45:  Oh, really?  

B.46:  It was the coldest it's been there ever in January [breathing], I think.
It's very cold.

A.47:  So, do you -- 

B.48:  But, I would like to go to Tempe.

A.49:  -- travel a lot or,  

B.50:  Do we travel a lot?  Uh, some, yeah.  Well, I've been a, I was a travel
agent.

A.51:  Oh. 

B.52:  I mean, I have been up until just a few months ago.  But I'm thinking of
going back to work [laughter].

A.53:  Huh.  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  So you know a lot of good vacation spots, huh.  

B.56:  I lo-, I know a lot of good places to go.  But you definitely need to go to
Hawaii.  Very [beep] definitely.

A.57:  [Laughter] That's your favorite?  

B.58:  Yes, it is my favorite.  My husband hasn't been to Europe yet and I'd like
to take him there.  And, but he's traveled all over the United States and I
haven't.  Like, I haven't been down south.  I'd like to go to New Orleans.
Have you been there?

A.59:  I haven't.  Where, where do you live?  

B.60:  We, I live in Yakima, Washington.  

A.61:  Wow.  

B.62:  So it's cold and rainy today.  It's yucky.  

A.63:  Um.  

B.64:  But we've had some pretty nice weather.  We played tennis outdoors until
last week, so --

A.65:  Um.  

B.66:  -- that's a pretty good deal.  So do you go to school in Provo, Utah?

A.67:  I do.  

B.68:  Do you use NuSkin skin care.  They're located -- 

A.69:  I work -- 

B.70:  -- in Provo.  

A.71:  -- for NuSkin [laughter].  

B.72:  Do you?  

A.73:  Yes.  

B.74:  I'm a NuSkin person.  

A.75:  Oh, really?  

B.76:  Yeah, I sell NuSkin, too. I,  

A.77:  Oh, my goodness.  

B.78:  I am my only b-, and best cus-, not only and best but I'm my best
customer.

A.79:  Great {faint}.

B.80:  Since we're not supposed to talk about this, though, is there anything more
intensive for the eye area than the eye cream?

A.81:  Uh,  

B.82:  Do you know?  

A.83:  I don't, probably, maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only --

B.84:  I have that, too.  

A.85:  -- other thing I would use. 

B.86:  I'm forty-two, I need something, I need more.  

A.87:  Than the intensive eye?  

B.88:  Yeah.  
 
A.89:  [Laughter]. 

B.90:  I didn't know if there was anything else.  And I use the Celltrex.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  But anyway, well, yes, NuSkin is wonderful.  

A.93:  Good, yes.  

B.94:  I think it's a wonderful product.  Do you use it?  

A.95:  I do, yeah, we get free products every month so,   

B.96:  Oh, my gosh.  That's great.  

A.97:  Right, right now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month, free products so,

B.98:  Yeah, oh, yeah.  

A.99:  I've worked there about a year.  

B.100:  That's good.  Are they good to work for?  

A.101:  Yes, they're wonderful to work for.  

B.102:  That's great.  

A.103:  Yep [laughter].  

B.104:  Anyway, so we're supposed to be talking about places to go and you have not
been to Europe.  Do you go to school?

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  Do you ski?  

A.107:  I ski, yes.  I've,  

B.108:  Ski, you probably ski very well in Utah.  

A.109:  No, I don't [laughter].  Actually since I grew up in Texas I've only been
here about two years and --

B.110:  Uh.  

A.111:  -- have gone skiing about three times.  A-, well, five times each season.

B.112:  Why did you move to Utah?  You're going, oh, you are going to school?

A.113:  Yeah, I,  

B.114:  At B Y U, is that where B Y U is?  

A.115:  Uh-huh.  Yep.  

B.116:  Okay, I know some people that went to B Y U.  That's great.  Pretty good.

A.117:  I do like to ski.  

B.118:  Pretty, pretty down there.  Huh?  

A.119:  [Laughter] Yeah, I, I said I do like to ski.  

B.120:  So, where, have you skied? 

A.121:  And it's, it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a
vacation in itself when you get to go.

B.122:  Sure.  

A.123:  If you like that kind of thing [laughter].  

B.124:  Sure, so you're a sophomore.  

A.125:  I am actually -- 

B.126:  Or junior?  

A.127:  -- a junior.  

B.128:  You're a junior.  

A.129:  Beginning of my junior year.  

B.130:  Good for you.  

A.131:  So,   

B.132:  What are you studying?   

A.133:  Nursing.  

B.134:  Good for you.  You sound like a girl that has it together.

A.135:  [Laughter].

B.136:  I would just encourage you to do a little traveling, though, before you get
married.  Because when you --

A.137:  You think, 

B.138:  -- get married, you won't have the money or the time.  

A.139:  I know.  

B.140:  So just, you know, don't, don't be in any hurry.  

A.141:  I'm not, I'm not.  

B.142:  You really should go to Europe.  I went to Europe for six weeks after I
graduated from college and that was just, I, I mean I could have had that or a
down payment on a new car and I took the trip.  And --

A.143:  And it was great?  

B.144:  -- uh, I traveled with a group of sixteen other students.  Actually they,
there was two other graduating seniors besides myself, and we just had a ball.
We stayed at,

A.145:  How long did you get to stay there?  

B.146:  Uh, six weeks.  

A.147:  Oh, really?  

B.148:  Yeah.  It was wonderful, so you should think about doing something like
that.

A.149:  Uh-huh, I just had a friend that got back from Europe and she was there
like all winter semester.
