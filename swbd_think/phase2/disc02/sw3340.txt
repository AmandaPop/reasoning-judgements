A.1:  So, Beverly, what do you think about drug testing?

@B.2:  I think in some professions it's, uh, essential.  Things like pilots and
things that involve the safety of other people particularly.

A.3:  Yeah.  We've, we got a lot of mistakes here, uh, in the Maryland, Baltimore
area because of, uh, train conductors --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- uh, on drugs.  I think we've had two terrible accidents here recently,
and also on, um, just like, I bet you within five days a truck where the, uh,
a dump truck, where the driver was, uh, high on marijuana, I guess he smoked
marijuana for lunch and, uh, drove his truck up the back of two small cars in
a tunnel that goes underneath the, uh, a river that leads into the Chesapeake
Bay --

B.6:  Oh, my goodness,

A.7:  -- and it would, that would, tied up traffic for a long time, everybody
died, the fire was terrible, it was awful.  So, yeah, I think you're right, I,
I think I, if it's, if you're in a field, but then you know, who would test
all truck drivers --

B.8:  They, that's, that is a problem --

A.9:  -- you know,

B.10:  -- and every time before they get into a vehicle --

A.11:  Right, yeah --

B.12:  -- I mean.

A.13:  -- I think, I think, looking at athletes being drug tested --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- I don't know, even, I think the random drug testing, I don't know in my
own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs, because they're
still being caught --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- that make sense?

B.18:  Yes, uh, it may make a difference for some of them --

A.19:  Yeah, and then, uh, I think,

B.20:  -- because they don't want to lose that lucrative, uh --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- career.

A.23:  I, I, I think, in the long run I think it's, it would be good.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  I think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have
gotten away with it --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- you know, the, the test hasn't come down hard on anyone --

B.28:  Uh-huh --

A.29:  -- I don't, I don't know.

B.30:  -- however, here in Dallas --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- uh, we had a, a player, Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing, and
was to the point, he was on probation, he was to the point that if he was
caught another time that he would lose his contract, and they wouldn't have to
pay him, and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him, but they couldn't afford
to replace him and still pay his contract --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- and, uh, just recently he was, uh, missing from practice and whenever he
missed like that, usually he had some kind of problem and --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- so a mandatory drug test was done --

A.39:  Yeah,

B.40:  -- was positive, so they were able to --

A.41:  Get rid of him.

B.42:  -- get rid of him and not have to pay his contract.

A.43:  Right, yeah.  B-,

B.44:  And so, in his case, he lost his whole career, he's been in the paper, in
jail, and it's just been awful --

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  -- and talk about a terrible role model,

A.47:  Right, I, I think, that, that, that's a terrible thi-, you know, it's
really funny though, um, I guess, my dad was hit by a, a drunk driver who was
also high --

B.48:  Um.

A.49:  -- um, when I was probably eighteen, my senior year in high school --

B.50:  Oh, my goodness.

A.51:  -- and, um, though he's alive today and everything worked out fine, it, it,
it happened about two blocks from the high school and a friend came and got
me, and I was there, and I could smell the dope, and I could see the beer cans
from the guy that hit him --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- and nothing ever happened, and from --

B.54:  Oh, that's terrible.

A.55:  -- from that point on, I became so anti drunk driving --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- now I think people should be allowed to drink, I think that's an adult
responsibility, whatever, but I really, uh, I'm so anti drunk driving, and,
and drugs have, uh, long lasting effects --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- and I guess when I younger I was, um, probably a little more liberal on
the subject.

B.60:  I think most of us are.

A.61:  Yeah, but as I've, as soon as that happened, I guess when I was eighteen
years old, if you'd have asked me, I'd have thought it was fine --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- but by the time I was nineteen my opinion had totally changed.

B.64:  Yes, if you know someone, for example we have, uh, some friends whose son
was driving home from work, was hit head on by a drunk driver --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- the drunk and his wife in the car were killed, and, uh, Bobby missed his
whole junior year of high school --

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  -- he went through surgery after surgery --

A.69:  Um.  Traction and all that terrible stuff.

B.70:  -- and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal
again.  And he, as far as his ath-, athletics, he's lost all of that.

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  He, uh, has been tutored, and he'll catch up in school and everything, but,
he's still not back where he was.

A.73:  Right, yeah, #I don't think somebody,#

B.74:  #He may never have# all those motor skills back.

A.75:  Yeah, you don't, you don't, you don't have the right to interfere in
somebody else's life.

B.76:  No.

A.77:  I can't even say, you know, I wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life.  You
don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life.

B.78:  Another thing that we saw here recently.  One of, some of our high school
kids were out goofing around in a park area that a, a train track ran 
through --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try
to play with the train.  Well, he, the train missed him, but, uh, a big mirror
type thing sticking out, like a metal thing sticking out, hit him in the 
head --

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  -- he was in a coma for --

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  -- four months, he's out of the coma now, and eventually they think he will
come back, but you don't know that, and --

A.85:  Right.

B.86:  -- but he's lost, he was an outstanding football player,
