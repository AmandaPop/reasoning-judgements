A.1:  All right.  What is your favorite show? 

B.2:  Well, I was just trying to think.  When they called, I didn't have as much
time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.  Um, I love watching
some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  And we, uh, to-, we subscribe to C N N and we took that, and we started
watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of
thing like the earthquake, and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.  The new
shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know, like the, uh, at
night the discussion talk shows and things.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh,
especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they
get here.

A.7:  Sure.  

B.8:  We have little ones.  Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE, 

A.9:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.10:  #and# we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  

A.11:  #It really is.# 

B.12:  #how to handle# things in situations.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  What do you watch?  

A.15:  I watch just about anything, 

B.16:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.17:  #but# not a lot of, 

B.18:  #Uh-huh.# 
	
A.19:  #T V.# I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get
home in the evening.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  And I usually watch, you know, the news and then I'll watch that HARD COPY
or --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  That's the same thing we do.  

A.23:  -- or that kind of thing, you know, and I like the NINE ONE ONE,

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  #and# UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.  

B.26:  Yeah, that kind, that's the kind I like really more than, 

A.27:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.28:  #the sitcoms.#  I haven't gotten, 

A.29:  #Now, I do,# 

B.30:  #into many of those.# 

A.31:  like, my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on
Monday evening.

B.32:  I have heard that's real good.  

A.33:  And I, 

B.34:  #That's,#  

A.35:  #uh,# 

B.36:  Burt Reynolds, isn't it? 

A.37:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.38:  #Yeah, I've heard that.# 

A.39:  And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch
that with him because it's really funny.

B.40:  Now someone told me that and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on
MURPHY BROWN,

A.41:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.42:  #because they# said that that was really good this season.  

A.43:  Well, his favorite night is Monday night so we've got to where we will sit,

B.44:  #You've got to [laughter] yeah,# 

A.45:  #and watch it on# Monday night, 

B.46:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.47:  #because# that and then that, uh, oh, I can't even think of the name of it.
Like I say I'm not,

B.48:  DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night, 

A.49:  #Yeah,# 

B.50:  #too.#  

A.51:  and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids,
Sergeant ((McGillis)).

B.52:  Huh, I don't even #know.#

A.53:  #Sergeant,# uh, MA-, MAJOR DAD.  

B.54:  Oh, okay.  Now I, 

A.55:  #Yeah,# 

B.56:  #we've never# even seen that.

A.57:  that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,

B.58:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.59:  #and# DESIGNING WOMEN.  So we always, he watches that and I kind of s-, I
watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,

B.60:  #On the others.# 

A.61:  #as I can.# 

B.62:  Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY
TWENTY.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  Or, um, 

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS
LANDING.

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.  Oh, excuse me just a minute
{talks to someone in the background}.  {very faint.} The money is right there on the
thing and the coupon.

A.69:  Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around
though.

B.70:  Oh, I know.  That's the thing.  And so, 

A.71:  #Except they,# 

B.72:  #we,#  

A.73:  #probably are in bed,# 

B.74:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.75:  by nine.  

B.76:  Well, they are.  In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight, but we
have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.

A.77:  Did you get your pizza taken care of?  

B.78:  Yeah, he has gone [laughter] to get it. 

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  Thank you [laughter].  Um, but I was (( )) to say on Saturdays there is
absolutely nothing and that's the day my husband,

A.81:  #Well, do you know,# 

B.82:  #wants to (( )).#  [Laughter].

A.83:  I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked and
that's SISTERS.  Have you watched that?

B.84:  No, but I saw that advertised today and it sounds like it's not fluff.  It
sounds like it's good.

A.85:  It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.  

B.86:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.87:  #I mean,# it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera #I guess.#

B.88:  #Yeah,# that's what they said it was kind of, 

A.89:  #But it's a,# 

B.90:  #a little more# drama to it.  

A.91:  So far it, I've watched it about three times now and it's really held my
attention.  It's been pretty good.  Some,

B.92:  #Well, and a-,# 

A.93:  #pretty good# acting.  

B.94:  and another one now that it's getting darker and you are wanting to cocoon
more, that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
Some of these,

A.95:  #Now I watched,# 

B.96:  #that are nostalgic.#  

A.97:  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time, 

B.98:  #Did you,#

A.99:  #but I haven't,# 

B.100:  like it?  

A.101:  I did.  I #liked it.# 

B.102:  #Did you?# Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality,
you know and,

A.103:  Now I haven't seen I'LL #FLY AWAY yet.#  

B.104:  #I haven't seen it either.# I think what I need to do is kind of read to
see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight
o'clock and then I get my bath --

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  -- it's, you know, it's almost too late to start, 

A.107:  #It's nearly,# 

B.108:  #something new.# 

A.109:  too late for T V.  

B.110:  [Lipsmack]  #Yeah.#  

A.111:  #That's# the way I am.  I get #in,#

B.112:  #Yeah.# 

A.113:  from work and I'm tired and I sit and watch for a few minutes so I have to
get up and do dinner,

B.114:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.115:  #and everything.#  [Lipsmack].

B.116:  Yeah, and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.

A.117:  Uh-huh.  

B.118:  [Laughter]  So, it's like, 

A.119:  #Yeah.# 

B.120:  #we are kind of,# 

A.121:  #That's us.# 

B.122:  #tuned out of our T V.# 

A.123:  If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos, #so.# 

B.124:  #Yeah,# well, we do too.  

A.125:  But there are some good shows on.  I, I really probably should watch more
of them than I do.

B.126:  #Yeah.# 

A.127:  #But I like,# I don't know I, I'm always in to making things and,

B.128:  I don't know, yeah.  There's a lot more to do with,  

A.129:  #And I don't just spend all my time,# 

B.130:  #with your time when you get into it.#

A.131:  and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.

B.132:  Uh-huh.  Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.  They
don't have children yet, and they just turn it on when they walk in, they turn
it off when they leave.

A.133:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.134:  So they are used to #that too.#

A.135:  #I could# be around here for hours by myself and never #have it on.#

B.136:  #Yeah,# I understand.  #Same here.#  

A.137:  #But, uh,# but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,
and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.

B.138:  Yeah, it's real good.  And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in
from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,

A.139:  #Yeah.# 

B.140:  #you know,# talk shows.  I like her.   

A.141:  I never get in in time for any of those.  

B.142:  Yeah.  

@@A.143:  {Very faint} Yeah.

B.144:  Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.  I guess we've kind of exhausted this
one, but it's nice talking with you.

A.145:  Well, it's nice talking with you.  

B.146:  Thank you.  

A.147:  #Bye.# 

B.148:  #Bye-bye.#
