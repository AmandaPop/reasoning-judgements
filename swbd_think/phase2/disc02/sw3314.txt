REMARKS:        Very difficult to transcribe.  Speakers constantly
spoke over each other and laughed over each other's words.  Tape
skipped in a few places in the beginning, but stopped (skipping). 
This was also a very long tape.

============================================================

A.1:   What are some of the T V shows that you watch?  

B.2:   Uh, MAJOR DAD, the Monday night comedies on C B S -- 

A.3:   Yes, I love those.  

B.4:   -- like MAJOR DAD [static] [laughter] [noise].  MURPHY BROWN
is one of my favorites.  

A.5:   Yes.  

B.6:   [Laughter]. 

A.7:   She is great.  I just love her.  

B.8:   For some reason, she reminds me a lot of myself [laughter]. 

A.9:   Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.10:   It's just the writing, I think the writing on that is real
good.  

A.11:   It is.  

B.12:   One I miss is, uh, DOCTOR DOCTOR.  

A.13:   Did you watch that one?  

B.14:   I u-, we used to when it was on.  

A.15:   Uh-huh, I #didn't.#  

B.16:   #Because# I, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  

A.17:   Did you, I guess I never really watched that one.  I guess by
eight o'clock I'm watching football.  

B.18:   Uh, yeah -- 

A.19:   #With my husband, so,#  

B.20:   -- #I understand that.#  

A.21:   [Laughter]. 

B.22:   I do understand that.  No [laughter],   

A.23:   [Laughter].  Yeah, that's a big one in our house is Monday night
football.  

B.24:   Uh, yeah, well, it used to be before we got married, but my
husband's not a real big football person, so ...   

A.25:   Oh, he isn't.  

B.26:   Well, he is if it's Dallas and if they're on T V, but -- 

A.27:   Right.  

B.28:   -- if it's not, then we'll watch anything else.  

A.29:   Uh-huh, well, that's nice. 

B.30:   Because he really likes MAJOR DAD and, and MURPHY BROWN all
those, too.  

A.31:   Uh-huh, and, and, uh, what's the other one.  Oh, with the four
women.  

B.32:   Oh, uh,  

A.33:   DESIGNING WOMEN.  

B.34:   DESIGNING WOMEN, yes.  

A.35:   Yes, I like that one.  

B.36:   With the Sugarbakers.  

A.37:   Yes [laughter].  

B.38:   I think that's one reason I named my daughter Julia [laughter].  

A.39:   Oh, really?  #Oh, that's great.#  

B.40:   #Well that, well,# and my great grandmother's name is Julia -- 

A.41:   Uh-huh.  

B.42:   -- so we named her that, too.  

A.43:   Yeah.  

B.44:   Uh, do you have kids?  

A.45:   Uh, no, we don't.   

B.46:   Oh, okay, I was going to say, because we also have to watch
DINOSAURS on channel eight, because ...  

A.47:   Believe me, we do, too.  

B.48:   Oh!  [Laughter]. 

A.49:   [Laughter].  #We do, too.#

B.50:   #Not to mama, not to mama# {mimicking} [laughter].  

A.51:   Yes, I love that show, it's so cute.  

B.52:   Well, when my two year old starts saying that, it's like,
okay.  

A.53:   Oh, no.  

B.54:   We, we know what he's been watching for too long.  

A.55:   Yes.  

B.56:   I just, I, 

A.57:   No, we watch that all the time.  

B.58:   Oh, #I like those.#  

A.59:   #We do#, it's a good show.  

B.60:   [Laughter]. 

A.61:   [Laughter].  I like it.  

B.62:   That's fun.  

A.63:   And then we watch the Thursday night COSBY and, uh, uh, 
CHEERS -- 

B.64:   That's,  

A.65:   -- we watch all the time and,   

B.66:   Normally on Thursday nights we just kind of turn the T V off
because neither one of us, really we usually either watch C B S on
Monday nights --

A.67:   Uh-huh.

B.68:   -- and then the rest of the time it's A B  C.  

A.69:   Okay.  

B.70:   It's like, oh, well [laughter] -- 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   -- we don't watch anything else, fine.  

A.73:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, Thursday night's a big one in our house, but,
uh ...   

B.74:   We used to when N B C had, no, that was on Tuesday night.  Uh,
MATLOCK.  

A.75:   Okay.  

B.76:   Because I got, my mom got me started watching that show.  

A.77:   Uh-huh.  

B.78:   Just because she liked Andy Griffith, so ...  

A.79:   Oh, yeah.  

B.80:   That was fun.  

A.81:   My husband's a big, like, mystery watcher.  

B.82:   Uh-huh.  

A.83:   Like, uh, the late night HUNTER -- 

B.84:   Uh-huh.  

A.85:   -- and all those.  He really enjoys those.  

B.86:   I like, yeah, I used to like it when COLUMBO, and, and --

A.87:   Uh-huh.

B.88:   -- all those were on and, and ROCKFORD FILES.  But it's like,
gosh, that seems like a long time ago.

A.89:   Well, my husband really likes those.

B.90:   [Laughter].  They're fun, they're fun.

A.91:   Yeah, they are.  And then we're on, we're on a big one with,
uh, HOME FRONT.

B.92:   Yes.

A.93:   He, 

B.94:   Yes.

A.95:   That's a real good show.

B.96:   I like that.  Well, I guess you probably don't get to see
NORTHERN EXPOSURE, then, if he's watching football on Monday
nights.

A.97:   Sometimes I do if I'm at my sister's house.

B.98:   That's, 

A.99:   She has two T V -s [laughter].

B.100:   It's, it's a real strange one.

A.101:   It is.  It's, it's, 

B.102:   It's almost, well, it's like TWIN PEAKS, but funny.

A.103:   Right.

B.104:   And we d-, we used to like to watch TWIN PEAKS for the first
season.

A.105:   Uh-huh.

B.106:   It was like, oh, this is really neat.  And then, it got weird.

A.107:   Yeah, I, 

B.108:   Like, real strange.

A.109:   And it was a show I never started watching until like one
night I decided, well, they always say this is so weird.  Let's,
let's --

B.110:   [Laughter].

A.111:   -- watch it and see if we can get the hang of it.

B.112:   Uh-huh [laughter].

A.113:   Uh-uh.

B.114:   [Laughter]. 

A.115:   [Laughter].  I couldn't understand, by the, by the end of it,
I was just going, now what did I just watch for the last hour
[laughter].  

B.116:   Now, who did what?  Yeah, because it's, you really have to be
dedicated.  We would, like, tape it and send the kids to bed, say,
okay now we can watch this.  

A.117:   Uh-huh.  

B.118:   Because you have to watch every scene to kind of figure out
what it's doing.  

A.119:   Yeah because I -- 

B.120:   And it,   

A.121:   -- was just, like, uh-huh,  

B.122:   Even then, it's like, huh.  

A.123:   [Laughter].  I know it.  I, 

B.124:   What.  

A.125:   And then we got, like the TIME magazine, because we used to
order that -- 

B.126:   Uh-huh.  

A.127:   -- and his face was on the front half distorted and half
regular.  

B.128:   Uh. 

A.129:   And it kind of talked about TWIN PEAKS and I still just didn't
understand what it was talking about [laughter].

B.130:   [Laughter]. 

A.131:   He was something else.  I just, 

B.132:   It was a really, really strange show, but, it's like, well,
I'm sorry it's gone, but I really didn't, got, towards the end we
didn't watch it at all anyway.  

A.133:   Yeah, I think it got too strange.  

B.134:   Yeah, give -- 

A.135:   Because you couldn't pick up #on it if you just# ...   

B.136:   -- #give me comedies.#  I'll, I'll watch those.  

A.137:   Yeah {faint}. 

B.138:   I like those.  

A.139:   Yeah, I like the sitcoms.  

B.140:   Yeah, I'm a, I'm a comedy kind of person.  

A.141:   Uh-huh, I really do like just the half an hour sitcoms and -- 

B.142:   Yeah.  

A.143:   -- maybe a couple,  

B.144:   Well, because, yeah, because you can like turn it off.  

A.145:   Yeah, and it's not, 

B.146:   You only have to watch half hour at a time.   

A.147:   Right, and it's always not, uh, week after week and you have
to watch -- 

B.148:   Uh-huh.  

A.149:   -- every week and you can pick up something the next week,
and ...   

B.150:   Well, unless it's like you have kids and you have to watch
FULL HOUSE and you have to watch DINOSAURS -- 

A.151:   Right.  

B.152:   -- and you have to watch ERKLE on Friday nights --

A.153:   So [laughter], 

B.154:   -- and, you know [laughter].  

A.155:   My husband's a kid.  We have to watch ERKLE, yeah [laughter]. 

B.156:   [Laughter].  I understand that.  Did you, did you happen to see
it last night?  

A.157:   Yes.  

B.158:   That was cute.  

A.159:   Where he, where #Carl killed his bug.#  

B.160:   #Pablo, Pablo.#  

A.161:   Yes [laughter].  Oh, yes.  

B.162:   It was like, it's just a stupid bug.  

A.163:   I know it, it was, it was something.  

B.164:   Yeah, but,  

A.165:   That, that a four, what was it, six hundred dollar bug, or
four hundred dollar bug.

B.166:   I know.  I think it was four hundred and eighty something
dollars.  

A.167:   Uh-huh.  

B.168:   So they went to citizen's court, ooh, ah.  

A.169:   But, I did see ERKLE regular.  He was on some show.  

B.170:   Did you really?  

A.171:   And he is, he's a good looking kid.  

B.172:   Huh.  

A.173:   He is a great kid. 

B.174:   Without the glasses --

A.175:   Yes.

B.176:   -- and the suspenders, and,   

A.177:   Uh-huh.  He is dressed normal and acted normal.  He doesn't
have that high voice [laughter]. 

B.178:   [Laughter].  But, have you seen the commercial for the ERKLE
doll?  

A.179:   I, he showed the ERKLE doll on that -- 

B.180:   It dances. 

A.181:   -- but I haven't seen the commercial for it.  

B.182:   I was like, oh, boy.  It dances, it talks, it sounds like
ERKLE.  

A.183:   Uh-huh, it's, 

B.184:   Oh, no, it even snorts.  

A.185:   Yes, it does [laughter].  

B.186:   [Laughter].  Oh, well.

A.187:   He took that on the show and they played that and I was like
oh, my gosh [laughter].  

B.188:   [Laughter].  It, these people, like, they really have lives, 
but --

A.189:   [Laughter].

B.190:   -- it's just kind of strange.  

A.191:   Uh-huh.  But he's kind of what made that show, 'cause I heard --

B.192:   Oh, yeah, 

A.193:   it was gonna go,
