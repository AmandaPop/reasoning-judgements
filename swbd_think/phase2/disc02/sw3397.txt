A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Well, it's not often you get, uh, many women interested in football
[laughter].

A.3:  Oh well [laughter].

B.4:  Do you follow football very much?

A.5:  I'm sorry, what?  

B.6:  Do you follow football very much?

A.7:  I don't, no, I haven't recently, um.

B.8:  [Laughter] Well we can talk about something else.  Do you have any, uh, you
married?

A.9:  No, I'm not, no.

B.10:  No, well, I guess kids are out.

A.11:  What's that?

B.12:  Kids are out.

A.13:  Yep [laughter].  

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  Are you married?

B.16:  Yeah, I, I'm married.  Got two boys.

A.17:  Oh, really.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  Wow.  So do you like football?

B.20:  Oh, I follow the, uh, the Cowboys but that's about it, uh.

A.21:  The, the same here [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.23:  Do you live in Dallas?

B.24:  Yeah, I, I, I am a pretty big Dallas fan, been for a long time --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- but I haven't been to any games recently.  But, uh, I try to catch the
game every weekend that I can.

A.27:  Really?

B.28:  Yeah.  Have you ever been to a Cowboy's game?

A.29:  I haven't, huh-uh.

B.30:  Um, it's pretty nice.

A.31:  We dec-, we decided just to watch them at home [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  But.

B.34:  That's good.  At least you, uh, follow the game a little bit.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Um, yeah, I'm not a fanatic about it.  I don't know who played when and who
does what like some guys are.  I just like to watch, and, and hopefully they
win [laughter].

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  That's about the extent of it.

A.39:  Yeah.  Right now I'm in, um, college, so I'm more into college football
than professional, I think.

B.40:  Oh, I see.  What, uh, school are you going to?

A.41:  Um, I'm at B Y U.

B.42:  B Y U, okay.

A.43:  Yeah, so.

B.44:  Leslie, what are you studying?

A.45:  Nursing.

B.46:  Nursing.  Great.  

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  My mom's an L V N.

A.49:  Oh, really.

B.50:  Yeah.  So, what are you planning to go into?  Do you want to be an R N or,

A.51:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, yeah.  Um, I haven't really picked a field.  I
haven't, I, I don't know, I've thought a lot about labor and delivery but --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- I don't know.

B.54:  Try that.  That's what my mom does, labor and delivery.

A.55:  Oh, really.

B.56:  [Laughter]. 

A.57:  Wow.

B.58:  Yeah, she loves it.  She, she really, uh, enjoys.

A.59:  Is she a nurse in Dallas?

B.60:  No, she's a nurse in San Antonio --

A.61:  Oh.

B.62:  -- but, uh, she's been, she's been working a, uh, on a late shift.  She
works the, uh, I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  She works the graveyard shift.  And she's worked that for, oh, years, when
I was small.

A.65:  Um.

B.66:  Uh, I guess probably going on twenty years now.  

A.67:  Wow.

B.68:  And she really enjoys it.  She likes the quiet that you have at that time
of the night and, uh, and, uh, she's, uh, she just started a new job at a
different hospital, closer to where she lives --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and she's really enjoying herself.  She really likes it.

A.71:  Well, that's great.

B.72:  Well, good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree.

A.73:  Oh thanks [laughter].

B.74:  Hope you'll like it.  

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  Do you plan on staying in, in the Dallas area?

A.77:  Um, I'd like to come back to Dallas.  Right now I'm in Utah, of course.

B.78:  Oh, uh-huh [laughter].

A.79:  So, um, but, my family's there, so, yeah, I'd like to go back.

B.80:  Yeah, uh, I think Texas, San Antonio in particular, has got a large, uh,
base of hospitals.  Uh, I don't know about Dallas.  I think Dallas is pretty
scattered.

A.81:  Are you in San Antonio?

B.82:  No, I'm, I'm in Dallas --

A.83:  Oh, okay.

B.84:  -- but I'm originally from San Antonio --

A.85:  Um.

B.86:  -- and they've got large medical, uh, center down there.  They've got the U
T Health Science Center out there also.

A.87:  Right.

B.88:  So if ever wanted, you know, pursue anything more than your nursing degree,
that, that'd be the place to do it.

A.89:  Yeah, my brother-in-law, um, is in the medical profession, I mean, he's at
medical scho-, school in San Antonio right now.

B.90:  Oh, great.

A.91:  So.

B.92:  Great.  

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  Well, like I said, good luck to you.

A.95:  [Laughter] Thanks.

B.96:  All right, well, um, take care, and maybe we'll meet up again some time.

A.97:  All right.

B.98:  Okay.  Bye-bye.
