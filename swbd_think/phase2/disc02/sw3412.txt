A.1:  Okay, uh, I guess, uh, do you have any, uh, favorite foods?

@B.2:  Well, I like to eat.  Um, I like to bake a lot.  I'm not a gourmet cook,
but, um, just enjoy a lot of old-fashioned cooking.

A.3:  Uh-huh, yeah.  I, uh, us-, we used to get the, uh, magazine GOURMET and,
uh, stuff like that.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  I, I did try [clicking] a few of the, the recipes in there.

B.6:  Well, how did that, those turn out?

A.7:  Uh, well, I made a, a, uh, a bread pudding, uh, fancy style and --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- it came out really good, I guess.

B.10:  Well, that sounds good.  My son takes the GOURMET, um, on the BON APPETITE
--

A.11:  Yeah, uh-huh.

B.12:  -- uh, magazine, and he has prepared several dishes.  Uh, and they've
turned out really well.  One of those is, uh, was, I don't even, I don't even
know what the name of the recipe is at this point but, um, it was just beef
cooked with a, a lot of wine and, and, uh, all kinds of spices --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- the Rosemary and those kind of things, and it turned out really, really
well.

A.15:  I see, yeah.  I, I do a lot of, I did, I've done some, uh, you know, things
like chicken and stuff in there, but I, I deviate from it.  I, I never like to
follow sometimes if there's something in there that I, I don't like I'll
substitute it with --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- something else, and, and, so, uh --

B.18:  Well.

A.19:  -- I like to experiment [laughter].

B.20:  Well, I do too.  Uh, in fact, uh, a lot of times I will just, uh, decide on
a, a meat and then just put some things around it, add some gravies or, or,
um, sauces and the, the thing I've found that's bad about that, if I don't
write it down while I'm being creative, and it turns out wonderfully
[laughter] --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- a lot of times the next time I think about it, I don't have that recipe
in mind.  I can't remember exactly how I fixed it [lipsmack].  So, I've
learned that when I am creative like that, that I try and make sure I write
that down.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Um, one of the things that I have had a lot of fun doing is collecting
recipes, well not really a, I don't have lots, but I have collected a few
recipes from restaurants, and, uh, we have, um, I don't know what part of the
country you're in, but I'm in Dallas.

A.25:  I'm in the northern area up there in Wisconsin, Minnesota.

B.26:  Okay, well, I'm in Dallas, Texas, and, um, here for years and years we've
had a waffle shop downtown.  It's closed now, but they had famous waffles, and
I happen to have that recipe right in front of me, which is really, um,
doesn't look like a heart healthy recipe at all --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- but it's delicious, if you're into waffles.

A.29:  Uh, well, I, I like waffles, but I usually go to a restaurant and eat them.

B.30:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.31:  I, uh, I don't even have a waffle iron [laughter].

B.32:  Well, [laughter] you need one of those for sure.  

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  But it has, um, like milk, and it has half-and-half in it --

A.35:  Oh.

B.36:  -- and, uh, of course, real butter, and.

A.37:  I like all those things that aren't good for you.

B.38:  Well, me, too, me too,

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  and I'm beginning to show it, too [laughter].

A.41:  [Laughter] Yeah, I, uh, I mean, we, we do use a lot of the, the margarines
and that, but I do miss actual butter.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  I don't, uh, use butter unless I do some special things, uh,
usually around the holidays --

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  -- and I tend to feel like I can justify us-, the use of butter during that
time, uh, not only just, you know, to put into the recipes, but to serve on
the table, too.

A.45:  Yeah, well, I, I know it's something that my wife picked up, was, uh, we,
uh, made some, uh, butter from, uh, you just take heavy whipping cream --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and you keep churning it until it turns to butter, so.

B.48:  Well, I've done that a couple of times not on purpose [laughter].

A.49:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.50:  I did that by accident a couple of times.  One of the things that I think
I'm going to try this, um, uh, this year for Thanksgiving is, I, um, I've
talked to a, a gentleman who prepares turkeys by deep frying them.  Have you
heard of that?

A.51:  No.

B.52:  He deep fries the turkeys whole in a peanut oil, and he says that, um, and
I haven't tasted them, um, but he claims that they are juicy and just very,
very good.  Um, he prepares, he can prepare up to a thirty-two pound turkey,
uh, with the method that he uses, which is just a big vat with, you know --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- lots and lots of the, the peanut oil. 

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  So I think that, I think that's a,
