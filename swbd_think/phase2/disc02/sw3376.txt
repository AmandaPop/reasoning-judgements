========================================================================

B.1:  Is that right?  

A.2:  Right.  

B.3:  Okay.  Well w-,

A.4:  Now what was your name again?  

B.5:  My name is Barry.  

A.6:  Barry, okay.  

@B.7: Where do you golf at?  

A.8:  Well, I don't, uh, much.  Well, actually hardly at all.  I, um, the only
times that I've actually golfed is we, we were, uh, going to a family reunion
up in Maine every year, and a bunch of the brother-in-laws and whatever else
would go out and play like a couple times during the week that we were all
there.  Um, [swallowing] and I've done that about three or four times I guess.

B.9:  I see.  So you are from Maine originally then?  

A.10:  No, I'm from, uh, uh, New York.  

B.11:  New York.  

A.12:  But we've got my family, my fami-, my dad's family is from Maine.

B.13:  Well, I'm originally from Nebraska, and I really didn't play much golf
there until I moved to South Dakota, and we lived on the golf course and I
took up, uh, golf at that time and --

A.14:  Uh-huh.  

B.15:  -- really enjoyed it and, uh, then when we moved to Plano, I really haven't
had the, we've lived here a year now and I really haven't, uh, golfed a lot.

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  But those times that I have been out I went to the, uh, uh, Plano Municipal
Golf Course, and then I've golfed a couple times, uh, at Chase Oaks --

A.18:  Uh-huh.  

B.19:  -- and that's very challenging at Chase Oaks, uh, a lot of water.

A.20:  What's it cost to, to play at, at now?  

B.21:  Oh, [breathing] if I go to the municipal course it's, uh, maybe twenty-five
dollars for eighteen holes.

A.22:  Uh-huh.  

B.23:  And, uh, it seems to me that when I was at Chase Oaks, uh, well, of course,
I took my son with me so we were close to, you know, fifty dollars or so.

A.24:  It's pretty expensive, isn't it?  

B.25:  It really is.  

A.26:  Yeah.  Real expensive actually.  

B.27:  But, uh, I enjoy it.  Probably, uh, 

A.28:  Uh-huh.  

B.29:  it depends on which day I go, uh, as to which part is most challenging
[laughter].

A.30:  Uh-huh.  What do you shoot?  What do you shoot when you were playing?

B.31:  Oh, probably a, for nine, uh, I ha-, t-, I, I felt pretty good with maybe
forty-one, forty-two around in there.

A.32:  Well, that's not bad at all.  ((In fact)), that would make you about eighty
four, eighty-two for, for eighteen.

B.33:  That would be a, that would be a darn good game for me.  Yeah.

A.34:  Yeah, but that's pretty, that's pretty good shooting.  

B.35:  I'm, I'm happy with that.  

A.36:  Yeah.  Well, what do you, what do you, uh, what do you find attractive
about playing golf?

B.37:  Well, I think what I find attractive is when I can go out, uh, with
friends, and, uh, on a nice day just to be out, uh, it's,
 
A.38:  {Yells at someone in the background} Jerry!  Hold on a second.  Jerry, she
is about to get my cord.

B.39:  Oh, oh.  

A.40:  Baby.  Got,

B.41:  [Laughter]. 

A.42:  a loose connection on this phone.  

B.43:  Oh, just, uh, I, I guess the thing that I like most about it is getting
away from work and, uh, although, uh, if I'm jogging or working out or playing
golf or whatever it's a, a time to get away from things but yet sometimes
things become more, a little more clearer that way too.

A.44:  Yeah.  Well, I, I like, uh, we, I probably played maybe five or six times
but we did that and, uh, but what I liked about it was I could, I could, uh, I
liked being outside, um, and, of course, the golf courses are, uh, uh,
beautiful.  The one that we played at in Maine was real pretty, and you could
be with people and yet wh-, wh-, uh, so you had nice, you had company and
stuff but then significant portions of the time you were off in an area of the
course by yourself too,

B.45:  Yeah.  

A.46:  which, uh, it was kind of, uh, [throat_clearing] the best of both,
[swallowing] both worlds actually.

B.47:  Yeah, that's nice.  I'm, uh, you know, it, it bothers me when, uh,
especially in this particular area there are so many people that play golf
that you tend to, uh, have a lot of people there and feel hurried, and I
don't, I don't like to feel rushed when I'm playing golf.  Wh-,

A.48:  {Very faint} Uh-huh.  What's, uh, what's, what do you do best on a golf
course?

B.49:  Oh, you know, it, it really varies from day-to-day, uh, if I'm, if I'm on
I, uh, really can hit, uh, hit my driver pretty well.

A.50:  Is that right?  

B.51:  And, uh, that's, that's a new experience for me because for about a year to
two years, uh, I couldn't hit my driver.  I had such a hook that, uh, I would
just use a three iron all the time and I could hit my three iron just about as
far as anybody else could hit a driver,

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  so I used that.  But then I took a few lessons and really, uh, worked on it
and,

A.54:  Oh, you took lessons?  

B.55:  Uh, yeah.  We had a golf pro, uh, and I took maybe two or three lessons,

A.56:  Uh-huh.  

B.57:  basically, uh, and, uh, had a golf pro and, and, uh, it was like maybe
twenty-five dollars for a half an hour.

A.58:  Uh-huh.  

B.59:  But, uh, he really helped a lot.  

A.60:  Yeah.  Do you own your own clubs?  

B.61:  Yep.  

A.62:  I guess you probably do, don't you?

B.63:  Yeah.  I, uh, uh, got a pair of used clubs for a Christmas present one
year.

A.64:  Is that right?  

B.65:  And, uh, so before that I had been using, uh, my little sisters, uh,
woman's set [laughter].

A.66:  Oh, yeah?  

B.67:  And I thought, boy, the first day I got those, uh, new clubs I'd go out
and, uh, really, uh, knock them dead, and, uh, it takes awhile to get used to
a,

A.68:  Huh.  

B.69:  new set of clubs.  

A.70:  My, uh, brother plays a lot like every weekend up in New Jersey.

B.71:  Is he a pretty good golfer?  

A.72:  Well, you know, yeah, h-, sh-, well, he should say it, he's, you know,

B.73:  Good.  

A.74:  which, which sounds pretty good, you know.

B.75:  We, uh, probably my most exciting experience I had playing golf was over in
Hawaii.  We took a vacation,

A.76:  Uh-huh.  

B.77:  and, uh, my brother and I went out, brother-in-law went out and, uh, played
in, uh,
