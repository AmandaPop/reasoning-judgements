=========================================================================

A.1:   feel about the, uh, Russian situation right now?  

@B.2:   Well, I am more, uh, more scared than, than ever actually by
it, because, to me, if you look at the, uh, situation in the Soviet
Union and eastern Europe --

A.3:   Uh-huh.

B.4:   -- it closely parallels the situation around the turn of the
century with the fall of the Ottoman empire.  

A.5:   It is very unstable right now.  

B.6:   Yeah, and there's the, the huge power vacuum and no one to
control the local economies over there, the inner, uh, trade
between those republics.  

A.7:   Right.  

B.8:   And, the satellites, of, or what used to be the satellites of
the Soviet Union.  And I'm afraid that it's just going to, going
to have regional infighting just like there was before World War One
and we're going to be stuck in another war.  

A.9:   Yeah.  I'm, it's really scary, because I, you know, I, I had
a conversa-, or I heard over a conversation that they had with
Gorbachev on the news -- 

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   -- stating that he needs to get, you know, like a United
States set up over there because they're not going to make the
winter without the food and the electricity.  

B.12:   Right.  

A.13:   And if they d-, if, if people don't have food and electricity
[breathing], they're going to go after it somehow.  

B.14:   Sure.  

A.15:   And they're, and they're going to fight it out instead of
doing it calmly like he's trying to have done now.  

B.16:   Right.  

A.17:   Uh, I went over to the Soviet Union, uh, about three years 
ago -- 

B.18:   Oh, really?  

A.19:   -- and it was very sad [laughter].  

B.20:   Yeah.  

A.21:   They, it, the economy over there is very poor.  Uh,  

B.22:   And it's worse now.  

A.23:   Oh, yeah.  And when we went over there, we were not allowed,
you know, off the bus or, you know, into the, you know, onto the
streets or -- 

B.24:   Uh-huh.   

A.25:   -- anything like that.  Well, when I went I did anyway
[laughter], and I got out and, uh, uh, you know,   

B.26:   Rebel, you.  

A.27:   [Breathing]  I know it [laughter].  We barely got back, but,
uh, we went into the black market --  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   -- Where kids our age were, you know, I'm twenty-three -- 

B.30:   Yeah.  

A.31:   -- and we went down there and these kids wanted anything that
was made that was American.  Lee jeans, your coats, your shoes,
anything that you brought with you and they'd give you things
because -- 

B.32:   Uh-huh.  

A.33:   -- they wanted these clothes and they looked just like we did
because they would ask for these clothes and stuff so after you
came out it was very sad.  People were in the real drab clothing
and whenever you bought something, you'd have to go through four
or five lines to get it.  

B.34:   Right.  

A.35:   And it was, you know, really sad to see that.  But, uh, yeah,
it, it's something else.  Every-, everything's breaking down.  When
we, the motel we stayed in, you know, you could only stay in
American hotels.  

B.36:   Sure.  

A.37:   And, uh, uh, the, we didn't have water for four days.  And
when we did get it, it looked like apple juice.  It was awful.  

B.38:   Oh, God [breathing].  

A.39:   And, and, you know, to see how -- 

B.40:   Hey, wait a minute, the water comes out here, it, it -- 

A.41:   -- they live over there,  

B.42:   -- looks like that, too [laughter].  

A.43:   Right [laughter].  And it was just real sad to see it that
way.  But, uh, you know, like our tour guide was a sixteen year old
girl.  

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   Uh, she was married and living with her parents, and, you
know, they live in the apartment buildings around there.  

B.46:   Jeez.  

A.47:   And so she got the job because she could speak English.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   And she got to be a tour guide.  And it was really bizarre
because, uh, she couldn't shave her legs or anything and they
couldn't get razors and so, uh, she asked for us to go into the
American shop and buy her razors so that she could do that.  And
it was just something else.  These,  

B.50:   The wonders of western culture.  

A.51:   Yeah, you know, 

B.52:   Get to shave your legs.  

A.53:   Yeah, and, and, well, you know, and, you know, everywhere I
went over there it was, it was like that.  But she wanted to do
that and, and so did every, you know, all the kids that were our
age were, you know, wanting to be more like that.  

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   And so it's really scary because there's going to be some-,
something's going to have to happen.  

B.56:   So you did this one year in college?  

A.57:   Yeah, I did.  

B.58:   Where did you go to school?  

A.59:   Uh, Northern State in Aberdeen, South Dakota.  

B.60:   South Dakota.  

A.61:   Yeah.  

B.62:   Uh, I'm an officer in the Air Force at, uh, Griffis Air Force
Base.  

A.63:   Oh, okay.  

B.64:   Yeah, so I'm, I'm just a lieutenant.  I'm only twenty-four,
so,  

A.65:   Okay.  

B.66:   It's interesting hearing from someone of my perspective.  I
always think that my view is always so much older -- 

A.67:   Uh-huh.  

B.68:   -- and, uh, more conservative, but, uh -- 

A.69:   Uh-huh.  

B.70:   -- I don't know, if I've maybe done older, spent a little more
time learning from history than -- 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   -- the average armchair, uh,  

A.73:   Listening to the T V type of thing.  

B.74:   Yeah.  

A.75:   Uh-huh.  

B.76:   Yeah.  And everybody's jumping up and down praising all this
and, you, you know, it's -- 

A.77:   They don't understand -- 

B.78:   -- great.  

A.79:   -- what's going to happen [laughter].  

B.80:   Yeah.  You know, there's, [breathing] I think there's only
one thing that's worse than the communist government and that's no
government [laughter].  

A.81:   That's right [laughter].  And right now, they're bordering on
that.  

B.82:   Yeah, there,   

A.83:   Because there's nothing there.  

B.84:   There really are.  

A.85:   You know, you've got two leaders.  One thinks he's doing it
and o-, Gorbachev thinks he's, you know, got it, and, you know,
Yeltsin's got half and [laughter], and the K G B is supposedly
gone, but, uh,

B.86:   Well, I don't think, uh, uh, I don't think you can rule out
anything -- 

A.87:   No, you can't.  

B.88:   -- like that.  

A.89:   You can't.  They're t-, they were too powerful for too long. 

B.90:   And especially when, [noise] when it gets to the point where
things are really desperate, then, uh, then the military becomes
a threat as well.  

A.91:   Right, right.  

B.92:   And, uh, you know, there, the military still has a lot of
power --

A.93:   Uh-huh.

B.94:   -- and somebody has to control all those nuclear weapons. 
It's not evenly, the situation isn't even, is so much,
