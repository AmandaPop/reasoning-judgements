B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  So what do you, uh, think is the, uh, the worst culprit for air pollution?

B.3:  Well, I think it's, it's probably a combination of things.  Um, factories
that, that burn coal as a, an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen
contaminants, you know, and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  Uh, those are the ones I think primarily contribute to acid rain, and I
think that's, that's probably hurting us a little bit.  It's hurting, you
know, it's hurting Germany, for example, too, and some other parts of Europe
where they, where they have high industry.  So we're not the lone ranger here.

A.6:  Yeah.  I, uh, I, it's hard to put the finger on, uh, what's worse, you
know, the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion, um, with, uh, your
hydrocarbons, uh --

B.7:  Yeah.

A.8:  -- causing the damage in which,

B.9:  Hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit, but I know we haven't
cured it yet by a long shot.

A.10:  Well, I notice on one of these, uh, home shopping networks they were
selling these, uh, halogen, uh, fire extinguishers --

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  -- and the halogen is, uh, an ozone depleter, and it got hydrocarbons in
there.  It's a very clean, uh, fire extinguisher, but it's, you know, really
bad on the environment.

B.13:  Yeah.  Huh.  Yeah, I guess I missed that one.  Uh.

A.14:  Yeah.

B.15:  Automobiles of course are contributing, too, and, you know, how, how we are
with our love affair with the auto --

A.16:  Yeah.

B.17:  -- kind of hard to do anything about that, I guess.

A.18:  I know, uh, in the Twin Cities area, I just moved out of there and was kind
of happy I timed it just right, but they had a new policy where in order to
get your, uh, your license, uh, your car license, uh, renewed, you had to meet
the pollution standards --

B.19:  Yeah.

A.20:  -- and, uh.

B.21:  We have that here, too, but it's part of the inspection sticker, you know,
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and, and the computer reads whatever the
ionization is coming out, and --

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  -- so that's, you know, that's the way they're dealing with it here.

A.24:  Yeah, uh, yeah I guess that was just mainly in the cities there, and as far
as where I live, I don't have to do that, but --

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  -- I have an old car which I doubt would, uh, would, uh, pass the
inspection, a seventy-six, and, uh, you know, there's no way I would put in a
lot of money to, to repair it --

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  -- to meet standards.

B.29:  It'd probably be difficult anyway.

A.30:  Yeah.  So, although I do what I can to, to cut down pollution, but, uh.

B.31:  I was just reading an article in, uh, MOTHER EARTH NEWS, MOTHER EARTH NEWS
magazine --

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  -- and, uh, they've got a new, uh, you know a lot of places are burning
wood --

A.34:  Yeah.

B.35:  -- a lot, a lot of people are burning wood, those of us who have, I've got
a place in the country, you know --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- and, uh, they've had catalytic con-, you know, catalytic converters on
those, on, uh, I think they're required in California and Oregon and, and
Washington, but they've had up those for quite a while, and somebody's come up
with a new one that, uh, sort of, it's a, it's a catalytic converter, it's,
it's a plate that fits in, you know, into the smoke pipe --

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  -- and, uh, apparently it sort of feeds itself.  The more smoke is
produced, you know, after you get to like five hundred degrees, the higher it
gets the more complete the combustion is.  And it sounds real neat.  I haven't
seen them priced anywhere yet, but that, that sounds like that might help
solve that problem even on --

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  -- you know, old, old, uh, older stoves that don't have any kind of E P A
requirements on them.  That might help a little bit, especially in some
places.  We're really lucky here.  We have a prevailing southerly wind that
blows just about everything out.

A.42:  Yeah.

B.43:  Now sometimes we get a kind of a, especially in, in, uh, autumn it seem
like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us, but most of the time it's
blowing out pretty well.

A.44:  Yeah.

B.45:  Probably blowing up there to you guys [laughter].

A.46:  Yeah, well, well around here I, we get, uh, well it depends, you know,
either in the, in the winter time it, it blows it your way, and in the --

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  -- summer time [laughter] --

B.49:  It comes back.

A.50:  -- we probably get yours.

B.51:  [Laughter] Yeah.  I really think, uh, you know, we're doing some, some
important things.  Education, raising consciousness awareness, uh, I know
school kids, I work for the school district here, and, uh, you know, this is
one of the big things with kids.  Kids are writing letters to the newspapers
about, you know, telling adults to --

A.52:  Yeah.

B.53:  -- clean up their act and, it's uh, you know, I hope we're not too late
with it.  We're, we're, uh, we're having all kinds of recycling.

A.54:  Yeah, well, it, uh, th-, that's a big thing, too.  I know it has nothing to
do with air pollution, but I kind of look at the way people treat our,
