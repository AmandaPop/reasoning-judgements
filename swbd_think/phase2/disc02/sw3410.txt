A.1:  Okay.  

@B.2:  Okay.  What do you feel are everyday occurrences that are invasions of
privacy, in your opinion?

A.3:  Well, uh, I guess, uh, one that comes to mind is the way the credit
bureaus operate.

B.4:  I, I agree one hundred percent --

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- especially whenever it's like they keep stuff on your record like for
seven years and they don't bother, like I know at one time I was unemployed or
something, and, and they, they kept it on my record for like seven months,
even though that I, seven years, even though that like, you know, I, I, uh,
they sent a letter in, but they didn't bother to include the letter for the
explanation why I got behind or anything like that.

A.7:  Yeah.  Yeah, we had a problem with them back, oh, five or seven years ago
where it, uh, some stuff was on there that was incorrect and --

B.8:  Well, that too.

A.9:  -- it was real hard to get it, get it fixed.  But they, um, they share that
information with a lot of people that.

B.10:  Well, that happened with me.  I, um, I had had a, a doctor's appointment
at, at, uh, University of Chapel Hill Hospital --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and there was two William Parrishes {phonetically spelled}, and they
were charging me for this other person, and I went through like six months of,
you know, because they kept billing me and billing me and billing me, and I
was like, you know, I'm not this person, I'm not seeing you, why are you
charging me?

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And I mean, they turned me in to the Credit Bureau, they even held my
taxes.

A.15:  Oh, they did.

B.16:  Yeah, I mean, it went a long ways (( )).

A.17:  You mean they held your, uh, refund?

B.18:  My refund --

A.19:  Huh.

B.20:  -- you know, and it was, it was a mess, and finally I got it straightened
out, but it, it took me almost a year to get that straightened out, and it was
for something, you know, another William Parrish that wasn't paying his bills
or either else they wasn't, you know, charging him.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  But it was really weird.

A.23:  Huh.  Uh, let's see, um.

B.24:  I think the biggest thing I think that are, is not just, well, not for the
average person, I, I think like the media is, is getting a little bit
overboard on the invasion of privacy on like different --

A.25:  On public figures.

B.26:  -- on public figures, yeah.  That, some of the stuff that they're, like,
like the tabloids and stuff are --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- are saying it's like really, like, I think Joan Collins, I beli-,
believe right now is having a lawsuit against I think it's the NATIONAL
INQUIRER for taking pictures of her when she was getting undressed in her
bedroom and --

A.29:  Oh, yeah.

B.30:  -- published them, and --

A.31:  Huh.

B.32:  -- I, some thing I think should be private [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  I would hate to know, if I was getting undressed in the bedroom somebody
was taking pictures of me [laughter].

A.35:  Someone between the curtain was, huh.

B.36:  And I believe they've got [throat_clearing] something now, I read in some
science magazine or something, where they have a infrared camera that can take
pictures like with inside your house to see if you have any drugs or anything
like that.

A.37:  Huh.

B.38:  I think that's kind of an invasion of privacy, too.

A.39:  Yeah.  I guess, um, another thing comes to mind is some of the quote
unquote routine, uh, traffic stops.  They do that, man, they do that around
Raleigh all the time.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  You know, they set those roadblocks up.

B.42:  Oh, yeah, to see if you've been drinking and driving.

A.43:  Yeah, yeah, and, you know, and, and uh, boy, they just, you know, they have
no reason to be stopping you, and they just, uh, they stop you and, uh, look
in your car a little bit, you know, lean in the windows, anyway.

B.44:  Well, I, I had something like that happen to me, too.  Um, I worked for the
Hilton for a while as a banquet waiter, and, um, one night, whenever I got off
work, you know, it was like two or three in the morning --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- because it was a big party, and, you know, I pulled out of that little
road where you (( )) pull out of the Hilton on the Wake Forest Road going 
home --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- and I looked up and I seen, you know, blue lights on, and I thought,
God, I just pull on the road, it can't be me.  So, you know, like I pulled off
the road, and I, you know, pulled off the side road, and the car followed, you
know, the police car pulled me over, and the next thing I know there was eight
cop cars and they all got out with guns and everything --

A.49:  You're kidding.

B.50:  -- and it, it really scared me really bad.

A.51:  And they were just stopping you because you were leaving a night spot,
probably.

B.52:  Well, they, they said that, it was suspicious behavior, and I looked at,
you know, the highway patrol, and I said, how could it be suspicious behavior
of me waiting until a light was green, making a left hand turn --

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  -- in the correct lane?  

A.55:  [Throat_clearing].

B.56:  What's to make, you know, and they, they went all through my car, and, and,
you know, while the highway patrolman pulled me back there, and, I, I think
they gave me a ticket for driving without my license.

A.57:  They did search your car though.

B.58:  They did, yeah, without my permission.  

A.59:  Huh.

B.60:  So I thought, I was really offended by that.  I thought that was a severe
invasion of privacy.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  And I think some of the laws that they're trying to pass right now, um,
especially in North Carolina, uh, I mean,
