A.1:   I guess we're be-, recorded.  

B.2:   Okay.  

A.3:   What, do you have any hobbies that you like to do?  

@B.4:   Oh, yes.  Cycling, computers, uh, backpacking, just about
everything.  

A.5:   Oh [laughter]. 

B.6:   [Laughter] Oh, I generically have, you know, millions of
hobbies.  

A.7:   All right, that's an interesting assortment.  

B.8:   [Laughter]. 

A.9:   My husband is into cycling.  In fact, he's out there right 
now -- 

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   -- before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the, the
time.  

B.12:   I'm not quite that bad.  

A.13:   [Laughter]. 

B.14:   I'm just a weekend cyclist.  

A.15:   Uh, do you have any, do you do any handicraft type things, I
think was the question.  

B.16:   Handicraft type things.  

A.17:   Yeah, whittling or [laughter],  

B.18:   [Laughter] Yeah, just whittle away my life.  Uh, no, no, I 
c-,  

A.19:   Nothing like that.  

B.20:   Uh, uh, 

A.21:   I, I do some things.  I've gotten into, uh, oh, I, I like to
decorate things and I do sweatshirts and T-shirts and I've gotten
to where I start, have started selling them at craft shows and
things.  

B.22:   Oh, that's pretty good.  

A.23:   Uh, and I have, have done fairly well at them.  I've had a, a
few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed, but most
[laughter],  

B.24:   [Laughter]. 

A.25:   of them have worked out pretty good [laughter]. 

B.26:   [Laughter] Yeah, they, my only craft work is kind of like
computers and, you know, go off to the little computer club
meetings, and, it's kind of nice because I've made money at it,
too.  Considering I, I work for it a living, but I, you know, I,
I've got a couple of articles published.  

A.27:   Oh!  

B.28:   It's kind of, kind of neat.  

A.29:   Yeah, what, what does a computer club do.  I didn't know there
were such things.  

B.30:   Oh, yeah, just all over the place.  They just get around and,
and talk techy or, or else, uh, uh, you know, like half the members
are really expert and the other half are like really not.  

A.31:   Uh-huh.  

B.32:   And, uh, we kind of help out the people who are really not
[laughter].  

A.33:   You don't, uh, you're not in-,  

B.34:   [Throat_clearing].

A.35:   into hacking or whatever [laughter].  

B.36:   Oh, I, I think I'm, I think I'm a hacker, but I'm not, not
kind, not the, uh, the, you know, dial around randomly trying to
break into computers type -- 

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   -- hackers, no, that's [laughter] one of those sports I don't
go for.  

A.39:   [Laughter] Well, that's kind of interesting hobby.  What else,
did you, you said you did cycling?  

B.40:   Yeah.

A.41:   What was the other thing?  

B.42:   Backpacking.  

A.43:   Backpacking.  We,   

B.44:   Yeah, I belong to a, a Boy Scout troop.  It beats paying
United Way.  I just, you know -- 

A.45:   Uh-huh.  

B.46:   -- donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have
fun.  

A.47:   Well, that's, we have done that.  Uh, our two older boys were
in Boy Scouts and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about
a year ago --

B.48:   Uh-huh.

A.49:   -- so we've [breathing], uh, done a fair amount of that in
our spare time, also [laughter].  

B.50:   [Laughter].  

A.51:   But, it, I, that's a great thing to do, you know, really. 
Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting?  

B.52:   Uh, well, just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest -- 

A.53:   Oh. 

B.54:   -- which is kind of out in east Texas.  

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   And we go to, uh, places out in, uh, uh, let's see what's
that, what's that state north of us, that state -- 

A.57:   Oh, that one.  

B.58:   -- yeah.  Yeah, that one.  That one.  

A.59:   Okay [laughter].  

B.60:   Yeah, yeah.  And, 

A.61:   To the, uh, oh, by Fort Sill there?  

B.62:   Uh, no, to another f-, a, uh, old Indian fort that's out
there.  Trying to think of the name of it.  Durn.  Well, yeah, no,
sorry, no memory.  

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   [Laughter]. 

A.65:   Have you gone, like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts?  

B.66:   No, I missed out this last year.  I wasn't able to get the
time off, but maybe next year.  It's a good possibility.  

A.67:   I've always thought that would be a real fun thing [laughter]
to do.  

B.68:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  When I was a kid, uh, we'd do the equivalent
thing in the High Sierras.  That was loads of fun.  

A.69:   Uh-huh.  Does, does your whole family like to do it, like you,
you know, for a vacation you'd go backpacking?  
	
B.70:   Uh, no, not quite because I'm not a whole family.  I'm just
me [laughter].  

A.71:   Oh, okay.  You just, oh, and, and you volunteer for the Boy
Scouts, huh?  

B.72:   Oh, yeah, I rent my kids [laughter]. 

A.73:   Uh-huh [laughter].  Well, s-, sometimes, uh,  

B.74:   It's better than, you know, owning on them and making payments
on them,  

A.75:   [Laughter].  

B.76:   and, you know, things like that.  

A.77:   Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea [laughter]. 

B.78:   [Laughter]. 

A.79:   Have, uh, you said you did it in the High Sierras.  Uh, do you
ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly
backpack?  

B.80:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  Uh, not recently because, you know, like the
Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month, you know.  

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   Someplace.  But, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that I want
to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or
something like that.  So, you know, they have lots of tours where
they get a bunch of people together and -- 

A.83:   Uh-huh.  

B.84:   -- off you go.  Which seems kind of reasonable because that
means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you,
which seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing [laughter].  

A.85:   Well, I, probably, probably.  

B.86:   [Throat_clearing]. 

A.87:   That's, uh, [breathing] well, my, my other things that I
like to do in my spare time, I'm, I like swimming.  

B.88:   Uh-huh.  

A.89:   Which is in now.  I've [breathing] done that and I, I also,
[laughter] when I like something, I usually try to figure out how
to make money off of it.
