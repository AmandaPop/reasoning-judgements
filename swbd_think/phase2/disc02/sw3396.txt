A.1:  [Laughter].

B.2:  Okay.

A.3:  Do I recycle?

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Cans.  That's about it.

B.6:  Aluminum cans.

A.7:  Yeah. (( )).

B.8:  Do you recycle newspapers or anything?

A.9:  No, because there's no really place, I think if they had more visible
places for you to drop stuff --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- people would do it more.  Instead of trying,

B.12:  I think they would.

A.13:  You know, because it's hard, it's bad enough you got to save the stuff, but
then you got to go find somewhere to put it.

B.14:  Right.  

A.15:  (( )).

B.16:  How about glass jars?  Those are recyclable.

A.17:  None of it.  I mean, see, at, at work all I do is paper and trash and cans.

B.18:  Huh.

A.19:  And then at home I just save cans because I, I know where that is.  That's
like on the way to work.  But --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- I don't know where the paper and the, the bottles and all that stuff is.
But I think if like apartment complexes.

B.22:  (( )) I'm on the phone long distance. {Talking to children}.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  Had to yell, had to yell at my kids.

A.25:  How many kids you got?

B.26:  Well, I have four. 

A.27:  Oh.

B.28:  And we try and recycle.  My husband is in the packaging business --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and, um, they use recycled newspapers shredded up for the filler for,
uh, it's a pad that they put on top, top of apples, boxed apples when they
ship apples --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- and it absorbs some of the, you know, the, when the apples get --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- the shipping, you know.

A.35:  Yeah, my husband, my husband hauls apples.

B.36:  Oh, he does?  

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  For what company, what trucking company?  

A.39:  Um, he's independent.  He hauls them for anybody.

B.40:  Oh, that's great.  Well, he may have some of our apples then, probably.
Washington's a very big apple growing --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- place.  Especially Yakima.  

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  You have to look for Yakima, Washington on some of the box labels --

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  -- and C V C Weyerhaeuser, that's us --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- that's us.  Well, so they have a recycling, actually they, it's called
Central Washington Recycling, and they have a, a whole center, and they have
it set up like a circus --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- where, you know, the green glass goes in this clown's mouth, and the tin
cans go up to the alligator, and, and so we, we don't recycle as much as we
should, but we do recycle newspapers --

A.51:  Yeah, I think --

B.52:  -- and cans --

A.53:  -- if they would --

B.54:  -- and bottles.

A.55:  -- if they would have it more where you can get it --

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  -- get to it, you know --

B.58:  Right.

A.59:  -- like in different places, like apartment complexes, they got trash cans.
Why not put the dumpsters for different things --

B.60:  Right --

A.61:  -- and, so --

B.62:  -- I think that'd be a great idea.  We're going to.

A.63:  -- and, and that way people would find it better --

B.64:  Right, right.

A.65:  -- because if you can't find it --

B.66:  I would like to see them.

A.67:  -- who's going to save it, you know --

B.68:  I would.

A.69:  -- because after a while you get tired of saving newspapers, I mean.

B.70:  Yes, you do, you sure do.  In fact, I put mine in my garage, and I'm sick
of them, but --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- we take them.  My little girl, she gets to collect the money --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- you know, since she has to haul them down there every day.  So I let her
keep the money.  Um, I was thinking the other day about, um, plastic gloves
that the dentists and doctors and everybody has to wear now --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- that'd be wonderful if they could recycle those.

A.77:  Yeah, but you know the,

B.78:  You know, as it is now, they can't.

A.79:  They can't?

B.80:  Well, I think they're nonrecyclable.

A.81:  Yeah, I think because of the, the disease and all that going around, they
don't know, you know --

B.82:  Right.

A.83:  -- they're calling them, uh, like, what do you call it?

B.84:  Contaminated is what they are --

A.85:  Contaminated, yeah.

B.86:  -- you know, they, but that, you know, plastic just doesn't disintegrate --

A.87:  Huh-uh.

B.88:  -- and that, that's a major thing.  I mean, how many pairs of gloves they
go through in a day.

A.89:  They use pair of gloves for every patient they see.

B.90:  Right, and I'm just thinking about the orthodontist where I take my child,
you know, for his braces.

A.91:  They use gloves for everybody.

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  I mean, the nurse, the, the dentist --

B.94:  Yep.

A.95:  -- his assistant --

B.96:  Yep.

A.97:  -- everybody in there --

B.98:  Everybody.

A.99:  -- has on gloves.

B.100:  Yep, well, it's too bad that they have to, but be nice if those somehow
could be recycled --

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  -- you know, that'd be better for everybody.

A.103:  Yeah, but they don't recycle those.

B.104:  And then the baby diapers, you know, I don't have anybody in diapers any
more, but gosh, I used my share of disposable diapers.

A.105:  I didn't use those.  I had a, a diaper service.

B.106:  Well, that's good.

A.107:  In the service, because I couldn't, my son was allergic to something in the
plastic --

B.108:  Oh, yeah.

A.109:  -- so I had [laughter], so it wasn't by choice --

B.110:  Yeah, but that's.

A.111:  -- that I couldn't use them, it's just, he couldn't wear them for some
reason.

B.112:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I used them with my last two,

A.113:  I don't know what it was --

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  -- but he couldn't wear them because of the something was, he was allergic
to something.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  So I had to put regular diapers on him.  Boy, that was a, you know, for a
while I had the service, but then you know, after, I didn't have it the whole
time.

B.118:  Yeah, yeah, it get real expensive.

A.119:  But the first, I think the first.

B.120:  Yeah, I think if people go back to cloth diapers, that's better for
recycling.  I mean, that's better for the environment.

A.121:  Yeah, because you can al-, you just wash those, you know.

B.122:  Sure.  Well, I see, in the future I see people, uh, being more conscious
of, we're going to be forced to recycle --

A.123:  Yeah.

B.124:  -- you know.  I see even plastic shopping bags, there's, you can return
those, and our grocery bags, our paper grocery bags --

A.125:  You can return those.

B.126:  -- has a five cent refund on them if you bring them back to the store.  Do
yours, there?

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  Oh, they do?

A.129:  No --

B.130:  Well, that's --

A.131:  -- huh-uh.

B.132:  -- oh.

A.133:  If they did that I would take them back all the time, because I go to the
same store all the time.

B.134:  Well, see, and I always forget, you know, with four kids, and, you know,
six people in this family, our grocery bill's pretty high.

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  And, you know, I get, you know, thirty or more than that, yeah I get fifty.

A.137:  But I think if they'd do it more with, with the money, like a nickel or
penny, even though people think it's not enough, but if you have enough --

B.138:  Yeah.

A.139:  -- being as a quarter's a quarter.  Doesn't matter --

B.140:  That's right.

A.141:  -- you know, my son could take a quarter and go buy him a candy bar or
something.

B.142:  You bet.  Oh, yeah.
