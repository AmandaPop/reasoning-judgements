=======================================================================

A.1:   Well, I don't know what to do about the federal budget.  Um,
there certainly have been ideas surfaced, uh, recently, uh, matter
of fact repeatedly by many people and I sort of wondered what your,
what thoughts you had on that area.  

B.2:   The, the first one is we need people in there that, that
understand, uh, numbers.  The numbers that are being thrown around
when, when we're talking in trillions of dollars.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   Uh, which is an astronomical sum and, and the people that are
talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means.  

A.5:   Now are you, are you talking about the elected people or are
you talking about #others?# 

B.6:   #The elected# people.  Yes.   Uh-huh.

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   Our, our, our Senate and Congress and, and people that, that
deal everyday and, and what's going to be done with those monies --

A.9:   Yes.  

B.10:   -- um, and don't really understand what that is or how a
budget even works.  

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   Uh, we need to elect people that are more, uh, or ...  

A.13:   I'm not sure how you would ach-, how would you achieve that? 
I mean if, 

B.14:   Well, let's, let's make them have a degree in economy, uh, or
economics.  

A.15:   So you would trust the decision making dec-, economists?  

B.16:   Well [laughter], 

A.17:   Sometimes called the dismal science.  

B.18:   [Laughter] Yeah.  But, but people that, that know the value
of a dollar that understand the #value of a dollar,#

A.19:   #Uh-huh.#  Yes.  

B.20:   um, and wh-, in, in, in the, the, uh, lobbyists, 

A.21:   #Uh-huh.# 

B.22:   #needs# them to be eliminated, uh,

A.23:   #Uh-huh.#  

B.24:   #from# Congress.  Um, 

A.25:   Yes.  

B.26:   They don't make pragmatic decisions.  They make a decision
based on consti-, constituency --

A.27:   Yes.  

B.28:   -- instead of a decision based on what they really believe.  

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   Um, you know, th-, or they tack on this, uh, pork bellies and,
and do things that, that are good for their area to pass something
that is, that is not good for the country.  

A.31:   Right.  So, so you would favor a law which said there could
not be lobbyists.  I mean right now lobbyists require to register
you'd just say,  

B.32:   Oh, I, I definitely would.  Yeah.  Get rid of them.   

A.33:   ((Ma-, make them all)).  

B.34:   Totally.  Uh,

A.35:   No causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for?

B.36:   I, I think that any company or anything that wants to
contribute to a fund -- 

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   -- should be able to do that, and be registered with what they
ever contribute.  But they should not have a one-on-one
relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them. 

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   That, that's a conflict of interest as far as I'm concerned. 

A.41:   Yeah.  

B.42:   When you are talking again, uh, billions and trillions of
dollars -- 

A.43:   Uh-huh.  

B.44:   -- uh, you're, you're jeopardizing the future of the country,
uh, for today.  That, 

A.45:   So, uh, you talk about jeopardizing the future.  Would you be
against any deficit spending?  

B.46:   I, I think to bring it in line you are going to have to have
a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in
line.  You can't ease into it.  It took years and years to build up
the momentum that's there now.  

A.47:   Uh-huh.  

B.48:   Uh, I, I forget the figures on the interest rate but it's
something like, uh, hundreds of thousands of dollars a second --

A.49:   Uh-huh.  

B.50:   -- in interest.  

A.51:   #Yeah.#  

B.52:   #Part# of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves.  We, we
buy from intimate international banking.  That's why we have
interest.  

A.53:   Uh-huh.  

B.54:   And, and I, I, I really feel that, that, that is part of the
problem that we, we've let things get so out of control that, that
we don't want to put the brakes on them.  

A.55:   But wha-, what practical steps could on-, could one take?  
Um, 

B.56:   By, by having a, a, a budget that is, is feasible, that is
reasonable.  

A.57:   Well, but everybody will say that he is for that.  #Uh, and,# 

B.58:   #Oh, of course.#  ((Sure)).  

A.59:   #and how will you,# 

B.60:   #And then add on to it.#  

A.61:   make that actually happen?  

B.62:   You take the gross national income  -- 

A.63:   Uh-huh.  

B.64:   -- and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross
national income.  One thing we could do is give a ten percent
income tax.  

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:   Across-the-board, everyone no matter what, 

A.67:   #Yep.# 

B.68:   #pays a# ten percent income tax.  

A.69:   Sounds like a good idea.  

B.70:   #Uh,#

A.71:   #Nothing# escapes, right?  No, no, 

B.72:   #That's right.# 

A.73:   #deductions,# nothing.   

B.74:   #Right.  No deductions.# 

A.75:   #Just ten percent.# 

B.76:   You pay a ten percent income tax.  

A.77:   Yep.  

B.78:   That's what you pay if you make forty million dollars, uh,
then you're going to pay four million.  

A.79:   Right.  

B.80:   I-, if you make forty dollars, you're going to pay four
dollars.  And, and that's it.  

A.81:   Yep.  So that, that's it.  That's I mean I, I agree with that
that's a good idea and is it your expectation that that would raise
the total revenues collected or, or lower them or what?  

B.82:   I don't know that it would or wouldn't.
