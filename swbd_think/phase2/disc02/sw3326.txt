A.1:  Okay.  My children are all grown up.  

B.2:  Oh.  

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  Okay, well, now see, I've got two children and, uh, they're, one is o-, uh,
just turned to be a teenager and the other one is on his way, so.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  [Laughter] I, uh, I'm a single parent, so I think it makes it more
difficult for me to, uh, you know, find time with my, my children since I --

A.7:  I'll bet.  

B.8:  -- work and then, of course, take care of the house a-, and all this good
kind of stuff.  Uh, so it's a real, uh, it's a real problem for me.

A.9:  I'll bet it is.  

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  What is the favorite thing you do with your children?  

B.12:  Uh, the, the thing that we like to do the most is to watch T V together.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  And, uh, the kids like to play Nintendo, but I'm no good at it, [laughter]
so I don't like to play.

A.15:  You just watch them play, huh?  

B.16:  That's right, that's right.  

A.17:  I, I tried it once or twice, but I didn't feel like I was very good at it
either.

B.18:  [Laughter] Me either.  

A.19:  My grandson got me to one day, but,  

B.20:  Yeah, they talk about these different levels and stuff and I've never got
off of level one [laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter] Different worlds --

B.22:  Yes.

A.23:  -- and how do you get to another world, you know?  And I, I don't even know
what they're talking about.

B.24:  I, I know, I agree with you, so, uh,  

A.25:  [Laughter]. 

B.26:  But, no, the other thing I think we like to go to the movies, too.

A.27:  Do you?  

B.28:  That's, yeah, that's a, that's a neat thing.  So I guess we're all in, uh,
you know, movie, uh, fanatics or whatever around here.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  So we like to do those kind of things.  

A.31:  I know when our kids were growing up, our, we were big into water sports.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  We had a boat and they all skied and in the summer we spent most weekends
on the lake with them skiing and they always took other friends with them and
we had a lot of fun doing that, but --

B.34:  Oh, how neat.  

A.35:  -- I had all girls -- 

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- so we didn't do too much sports wise.  

B.38:  Oh. 

A.39:  I find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball --

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  -- and -- 

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  -- little boys do all of those things -- 

B.44:  Oh, yeah.  

A.45:  -- but,  

B.46:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, see, I have a son and, uh, you know, it's football in the
fall and, and baseball in the spring and, and --

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  -- it's one activity after another.  I, I'm constantly going back and
forth.

A.49:  I'll bet you really are.  

B.50:  Yeah.  And my daughter has, uh, tennis, so it's between tennis and, and
bowling.  My, I bowl so, you know, we're pretty active as a sports, you 
know --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- in, in the family, so,   

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  It, it's really neat.  

A.55:  Well, when mine were real little, they all played soccer but, 

B.56:  [Throat_clearing].

A.57:  you know, that was just for a couple of years -- 

B.58:  Uh-huh.   

A.59:  -- when they were pretty small for girls and then they got more interested
in other things,

B.60:  [Laughter] Boys [laughter].

A.61:  [Laughter] I'm not sure that they would admit it at that age, that it was
boys, 

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  but I think that's probably what it was.  

B.64:  Oh, yeah.  I, I know that, uh, my daughter, uh, even though she goes out
with the, the sports and everything, uh, yeah she likes to watch the football
for, uh, the kids [beep].  I'm sorry.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  Uh, that was a cat that hit the telephone.

A.67:  [Laughter]. 

B.68:  Get away, cat, gosh {speaking to cat}.  I guess it's why they wanted to do
it on this type of telephone because [laughter] there's all kind of activity
that goes on.

A.69:  [Laughter]. 

B.70:  But, uh, yeah, my, uh, my kids are, they're starting to grow up, you know.
It's not going to be too many more years before I, uh, uh, you know, they'll
be gone and, and, uh, there won't be as many activities.  Do you, uh,

A.71:  But they, but you enjoy them, I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy
them.

B.72:  Yeah, I, I agree with you.  I, I do.  I'm so glad they're out of the, that
young, real young --

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- age and the babies,  

A.75:  And, I mean, I didn't, it wasn't that I didn't like them -- 

B.76:  Right.  

A.77:  -- when they were little, but the older they got, I enjoyed them as
teenagers.

B.78:  Yes, yes.  

A.79:  And now that they're each, of course three girls, they're each becoming
the, they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  

A.81:  How, what kind of mothers they are, what kind of --

B.82:  Oh, yeah.

A.83:  -- wives, you know.  

B.84:  Yeah, that's so true.  

A.85:  How they do things and,  

B.86:  Well, do you, do the, do your daughters live close where you can go out?

A.87:  Two of them live real close to me.  

B.88:  Oh, good.  

A.89:  So we, we spend a lot, most of our time spent with them is, they come over
to eat.

B.90:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  

A.91:  And bring the kids and we play with the kids, you know.  

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  But, uh,  

B.94:  Yeah.  

A.95:  Where d-, oh, we go camp out, they camp out -- 

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  -- and we spend weekends at the, in the country with them -- 

B.98:  Uh-huh.  

A.99:  -- quite a bit, but -- 

B.100:  Uh.  

A.101:  -- as far as doing any activity, now that the grand kids are here, we all
just stay around the house mostly.

B.102:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  That's true.

A.103:  [Laughter]  It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids.

B.104:  Oh, yes, oh, yes.  

A.105:  [Laughter].  

B.106:  Boy, I know, especially when they grow up like that, so I'm trying to,
these last five or six years, I'm trying to make them really special and --

A.107:  Uh-huh.  

B.108:  -- uh, very precious since that's, uh, about the only time we've got left.

A.109:  They'll always remember it, too.  

B.110:  Yes, yes, absolutely.  I, I think so, too.  

A.111:  I hear mine saying, well, I remember mother and daddy used to take us to do
so and so.  I need to take my boys to do this or that, you know.

B.112:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.113:  And I remember the year we went to Disneyworld, as quick as my kids are big
enough, we're going to go to Disneyworld [laughter].

B.114:  [Laughter]. 

A.115:  You know [laughter].  

B.116:  There we go.  I know, I know they can't wait [laughter].  

A.117:  Yeah, they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they
had fun.

B.118:  That's right, that's right.  

A.119:  But,  

B.120:  Yeah, so well, I still got a few more years, so I'm, uh, I'm hanging onto
those and doing as much activity as I can with them.

A.121:  Do you work?  

B.122:  Yes, uh-huh, I sure do.  

A.123:  Uh-huh.  

B.124:  And I work full time, so, uh, it, it, that cuts into our free time right
there.

A.125:  It really does.  The time you have with them has to be quality time then.

B.126:  That's right, that's right and, uh, vacations are very special for us, and
activities.

A.127:  I imagine that they have, uh, some, a lot of homework, too. 

B.128:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, this being a school night and stuff, so, uh, it's,
it's in the same old y-, you know, routine of, uh, you know, doing homework
and, you know, trying to talk between all of that and, and, uh, the other
activities that we all have.

A.129:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, there's just so many things to do with them
nowadays, though, and especially if they're active kids.

B.130:  Uh-huh.

A.131:  Like you say you bowl.
