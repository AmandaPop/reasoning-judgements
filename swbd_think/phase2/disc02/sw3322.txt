A.1:  Uh, I take a lot of magazines that I don't have time to read right away.
#How about you?#

B.2:  #[T V] [Laughter]# Well, I normally buy them at the grocery store.  I get
like [baby_crying] MCCALL'S and WOMAN'S DAY #and# --

A.3:  #Oh.# 

B.4:  -- and LADIES' HOME JOURNAL [sigh].  

A.5:  And that way, you can get them as you, as you want to read them.

B.6:  Yeah, if I have time to read them [sigh].  

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  #[Clinking] But# ...

A.9:  #Well,# mine, I subscribe, and then I'll let them stack up #and# --

B.10:  #[Laughter].#

A.11:  -- and then I'll drop my subscription for a #year and catch up.#

B.12:  #[Laughter]# I understand that.  

A.13:  Uh, #you, you think you can# ... 

B.14:  #Actually, for a while,# we were taking, like FAMILY HANDYMAN and --

A.15:  #Yes.#

B.16:  -- #THOUSAND# AND ONE HOME IDEAS. 

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  #Because our# house is like forty-five years, well, fifty years old now.

A.19:  Oh, my.  

B.20:  And we were trying to do, see what we could do for renovations, so
[baby_crying] ...

A.21:  Oh, well that's good.  Do you find the magazines help you on that?

B.22:  They really, uh, they've got a lot of good ideas [swallowing].  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  #Well, we# ...  

B.24:  #And it,# it's nice to get, I mean, at least on those, you could get a lot
of tips from it.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  Which, you may not want to do the project exactly like they show you how to
do it, but --

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  -- at least they'll give you ideas that you can use parts and bits and
pieces of it.

A.29:  I have a friend who does that with her magazines and she keeps a file --

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- and cuts them out and then she has them when she needs them.

B.32:  That's, I've started doing that because I had so many magazines pile up on
my desk at work and [child] --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- then around the house is t-, cutting out recipes and -- 

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- putting them in like a photo album.  

A.37:  Oh, yeah, #that's a# -- 

B.38:  #And,# --

A.39:  -- good idea.

B.40:  -- as long as they're only on one side of the page.  

A.41:  #Uh-huh.#

B.42:  #But,# that way, you know, you can do that with recipes out of anything and
then little organizing tips and --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- and handy hints around the house and that kind of stuff. 

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  But I like, I like those kind of, the women's magazine, I guess they're
called [lipsmack] #[laughter].#

A.47:  #Uh-huh.  Oh,# yes, oh, yes.  I think that my husband gets as much out of
the recipes as --

B.48:  #Uh-huh [sniffing].#  

A.49:  -- #I do# on those.  He likes to read those.  

B.50:  Uh-huh.  Well they've got some, some good ideas on things that I probably
wouldn't try otherwise [sniffing].  

A.51:  That's true.

B.52:  #You know.# 

A.53:  #And then,# you read halfway through the recipe and it's stuff you don't
buy #otherwise.#

B.54:  #[Laughter] Uh-huh.#  Exactly #[laughter].#  

A.55:  #Yeah.#  

B.56:  Yeah, we do that, too [laughter].  

A.57:  We also take, uh, A PROGRESSIVE,

B.58:  [Clinking].

A.59:  FARMER and we, uh -- 

B.60:  #Oh.# 

A.61:  -- #get# a lot of hints, uh, we have a, a weekend farm and we get a lot of
hints on gardening from that.

B.62:  Oh. 

A.63:  And then the gardening magazines.  #And, uh# -- 

B.64:  #Oh, that# would be good.  

A.65:  -- I found out that we could plant, uh, fall potatoes and I'm going to wait
in --

B.66:  #Ooh.#  

A.67:  -- #hopes# that they grow.  

B.68:  Ooh.  

A.69:  So, uh, #I guess# ... 

B.70:  #My mother-in-law# does a lot of gardening and I know she takes a couple of
gardening magazines, too.  #As well as# --

A.71:  #A lot of those# ... 

B.72:  -- as well as seed catalogs.  

A.73:  Uh-huh, oh, yeah.  The seed catalogs are fun to look #through even if 
you# --

B.74:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#  

A.75:  -- don't buy them.  

B.76:  I like to look through just when we go down there.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  That's interesting because they have a little, a little place outside of
Waxahachie, so ...

A.79:  Ooh, #well, that's# ... 

B.80:  #That's {hiccup} nice to# go down there.  

A.81:  Oh, and right where the rain is tonight.  

B.82:  Yes, #yes,# --

A.83:  #Oh.#

B.84:  -- exactly [clinking].  

A.85:  Oh, my, are they all right?  

B.86:  [Laughter] Uh, as far as we know.  Actually, I think they're out of town
this, or they, they're either on their way back or, or just got back from
Georgia so [sniffing] [sigh] --

A.87:  Hopefully {faint, mumbled}.  

B.88:  -- hopefully they missed most of the rain [sigh] [noise].

A.89:  Yeah.  On the magazines, again, it sounds like you and I like about the
same things.  #I like# --

B.90:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.91:  -- to look at the pretty pictures [laughter].  

B.92:  I do, too, I like to look at some of the fashion things, #going I'd# -- 

A.93:  #Uh-huh.#

B.94:  -- never buy that.  For that price, I can get it at Target or [laughter] --

A.95:  Uh-huh.  

B.96:  -- somewhere else and I can make do with something [laughter] a lot
closer #[laughter].#

A.97:  #Uh-huh and if it's going to cost# that much I'll do with what I already
have.

B.98:  Uh, yeah.  #That's a [swallowing] [lipsmack]# ...

A.99:  #Right.#  Or some of the styles are kind of weird, too, #so.#  

B.100:  #They# really are.  I, I noticed one today as I was looking through a
magazine, uh, again, cleaning out my desk and #looking# --

A.101:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.102:  -- for one specific thing and I found an article on [talking], you take
this red wool s-, knit wool dress --

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  -- and you can accessorize it with beads #or with# -- 

A.105:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.106:  -- with, uh, [swallowing] you can put a sweater over it, or you can just
wear it with leggings --

A.107:  Uh.  

B.108:  -- or you could wear it with all different jewelry.  And, it's like --

A.109:  #And belt.#  

B.110:  -- #okay.#

A.111:  Yeah.  #Give you some good ideas.#

B.112:  #That would be cute.#  It would be cute, but I couldn't see myself doing
any of that #[laughter].#

A.113:  #No [laughter].#  #Oh, well.#

B.114:  #I'm only# thirty, but I just still can't see myself doing that [talking].

A.115:  Oh, well [sigh].  There's some of us that are, uh, 

B.116:  [Talking].

A.117:  don't do things like that #[laughter].#

B.118:  #Yeah.#  

A.119:  I, I see people come in with the leggings up to whatever, and #the# --

B.120:  #Oh [sigh].#  

A.121:  -- real short things and I don't know how they [breathing], 

B.122:  [Sniffing].

A.123:  but, I guess if they feel comfortable in them.

B.124:  Well, yeah, that's, I can, I like what they call harem pants, the baggy
#slacks, but# --

A.125:  #Oh, yeah.#  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  -- I can't see wearing just the leggings and a --

A.127:  Uh-huh.

B.128:  -- a, a sweater, seem like it, like, nope, sorry, not my style.

A.129:  Yeah.  

B.130:  #Not quite.# 

A.131:  #I was looking# at a magazine today at the hairstyles, and it was showing
what it assumed was, I think, twelve different styles.

B.132:  Uh-huh.  

A.133:  And they were all cut alike.  

B.134:  Huh.  

A.135:  But they did something a little different with them.

B.136:  Uh-huh.  

A.137:  #(( )).#

B.138:  #But# that, that I would be interested in.  

A.139:  #Yeah.#  

B.140:  #That# would be good #[laughter].#  

A.141:  #That helps.#  #And, of course# ...  

B.142:  #If I could# actually get my hair to do that [/talking].  

A.143:  Yeah, and, course, the proverbial diets and -- 

B.144:  #[Laughter].# 

A.145:  -- #uh, all that, but every book seems to have a diet in it.#  

B.146:  And Mary Ellen's help-, helpful hints, #and all those.  Now see, I like
those. #

A.147:  #Oh, yeah, I lost twenty-five pounds.# 

B.148:  #I think those are fun.#

A.149:  #Yeah.  I lost twenty-five# pounds, now you can do the same.  

B.150:  #That's right.#  

A.151:  #Oh, yeah# #[laughter].# 

B.152:  #That's right.#  Sure, just eating right seven days a week, #and# ...

A.153:  #Uh-huh.#  #And exercise.# 

B.154:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.155:  And do all this fancy stuff at morning, noon and night.  

B.156:  Uh-huh.  

A.157:  #Well.# 

B.158:  #When# we have two kids and, and have to work full-time.  Right, #right.#

A.159:  #Right.#  And you -- 

B.160:  [Laughter]. 

A.161:  -- do this in your spare time.  While you're talking on the telephone.

B.162:  That's right, that's right.  

A.163:  #Right.#  

B.164:  #You're# supposed to [/T V],
