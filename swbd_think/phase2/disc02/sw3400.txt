A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  All right.

A.3:  What, what, what was your name?

B.4:  Patricia.

A.5:  Patricia, okay.

B.6:  And yours is.

A.7:  Charley.

B.8:  Charley, right.

@A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Well, I, I listen to the radio whenever I can, I watch T, T V news at
night, but I'm really a big reader.  So I read that paper from front to back,
but I don't think either of the papers I get here in the Metroplex are that
great.

A.11:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Especially the STAR TELEGRAM.  I get that one.  It's, it's not the highest
[laughter] quality I don't think.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  And I get the DALLAS MORNING NEWS, and it's kind of fading.  No, [noise]
{like finger_snaps} not the MORNING NEWS, I get the TIMES HERALD.  What do you
get?

A.15:  Um, I read the, um, DALLAS MORNING NEWS.  We, we've moved --

B.16:  (( )).

A.17:  -- here about six month or, no eight months ago.

B.18:  Oh, where'd you move from?

A.19:  North Carolina.

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  And so I tried the TIMES HERALD first, and then I tried the, tried them
both and I ended up back with the DALLAS MORNING NEWS.

B.22:  Yeah, I think it's the better of the papers.

A.23:  Yeah, I don't, I don't, and I pretty well read it, uh, I kind of, I mean, I
go through the whole paper.  I don't read every,

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  Karen would you not, run on, please, run on from out here.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  Uh, I don't, uh, I, I pretty well look at it all the way through every day
--

B.28:  Yeah, I do too.

A.29:  -- and then I listen to, I listen on, I have a forty-five minute drive, so
I listen to the news on National Public Radio.

B.30:  Oh, yeah, I love that.  I think that's so good.  Once you've listen to
that, you can't believe the regular radio news.

A.31:  Yeah, yeah, and they have a lot of, um, early breaking stories before --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- before anyone else does.  So I kind of like that.

B.34:  Yeah, I like, I like that too. 

A.35:  Yeah.  And I guess, uh, I'm getting used to the DALLAS MORNING NEWS.  I
didn't like it as much as the paper that, from where we moved --

B.36:  Oh.

A.37:  -- but, uh.

B.38:  I don't think any of our papers in the area are great papers.  You might
have had a really excellent one.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  But you know, you have to get a local paper or you won't know what's going
on.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  That's why I get the Fort Worth one, which I didn't do for years before we
moved over here but [breathing] it's the only way I could find out what was
going on in my own city of Arlington.  So I had to --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- subscribe to it finally [laughter].

A.45:  We used to live in Fort Worth and we got that paper --

B.46:  Oh, really.

A.47:  -- that was like a number of years ago.

B.48:  Oh.

A.49:  And I liked it, I, [child_crying] of course, uh, that was probably fifteen
years ago.

B.50:  Yeah, well, the editorial page is [noise] {like finger_snaps} pretty good
of course, they, you know, they follow things they get from other places.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  But, uh, I'm not real thrilled with, with the paper.

A.53:  Do you listen to nati-, do you listen, you say listen to National Public
Radio.

B.54:  Yeah, I listen to that quite a bit when I can.

A.55:  Yeah, I listen to it, I guess, uh, well, every day on the way in and every
day on the way home.

B.56:  Yeah, you really get a whole story.  You know, the news on television is
probably, I think, the worst source --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- because it's like eight minutes of top news out of the whole half hour
by the time you take all those, you know, the ads and the sports and the
features and the --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- the cute little talk, you know [laughter].

A.61:  Yeah.  I don't know, I guess, um, I used to watch T V news, but I don't
hardly ever watch it any more.  Uh.

B.62:  Uh, I'll catch the ten o'clock sometimes, or if there's a story that I'm
really interested in, I'll, I'll try to.

A.63:  Yeah, I'll turn it on if there's a, how about NIGHTLINE.  Do you ever watch
any programs like that?

B.64:  Oh, I love NIGHTLINE.

A.65:  Yeah, I like that too, but it's --

B.66:  Yeah, I like that.

A.67:  -- it's hard sometimes to stay up for me -- 

B.68:  Yeah, it really is --

A.69:  -- that late.

B.70:  -- if you have to do something early.  Where do you work, do you work at T
I? No, you don't work at T I do you.

A.71:  No, I work for a mechanical contractor.  Um.

B.72:  Where, where, where do you have to drive to?

A.73:  Uh, Farmers Branch, from Plano, so takes about forty-five minutes.

B.74:  Oh, yeah, you go, against all that traffic, I guess --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- on L B J or something.

A.77:  Well, no, I go kind of a back way, but it still --

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  -- it takes forty-five or fifty minutes.

B.80:  Yeah, well my husband drives from here in Arlington to T I on Central
[laughter].

A.81:  Yeah, well, that's a good drive.

B.82:  Yeah, he listens to a lot of news [laughter].  But.

A.83:  Well, do you read any, uh, do you do, read any magazines or anything like
that?

B.84:  Yeah, um, well, just TIME, as far as news.  

A.85:  Yeah.

B.86:  I mean, we get a lot of magazines, but that, that's the only news one that
I get.

A.87:  Yeah.  Do you read it, pretty regular?

B.88:  Oh, yeah, uh, well, I didn't like it this week.  It was just all about
California, and I don't care that much about [laughter].  Uh, did you get it
this week?

A.89:  No, I don't --

B.90:  The whole issue's is, oh.

A.91:  -- we don't take, we don't take many magazines.  Occasionally I'll, I'll
see one somewhere --

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  -- and look at it, but, um, I don't, uh, seems like it takes too much time
or something.

B.94:  Well, that's true.  No, we do get TIME, and, um --

A.95:  Um.

B.96:  -- I, I read it pretty well, you know, I especially read the political
news.

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  Uh, um, I like to keep up with that, but, um, like you said, I think the
best source of all is the Public Radio [laughter] --

A.99:  Yeah.

B.100:  -- and, well, NIGHTLINE'S great, especially when something exciting is
going on, you know.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  Then I, then I'll really make a poi-, well, you know, it used to come on at
ten thirty, which was better, but then they put that silly ENTERTAINMENT
TONIGHT.

A.103:  Yeah, so it comes on at eleven now?

B.104:  Right.

A.105:  Yeah, so I'm still used to North Carolina time.  It was, um, oh, it was
eleven up there, I think.

B.106:  Oh, was it.

A.107:  Yeah --

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  -- but that's, still that's awful late.

B.110:  I know, I wish it would come on earlier.  But obviously the sitcoms make
more money, or they, you know, or they wouldn't have it on at eleven
[laughter] --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

@@B.112:  -- but, uh, uh, well, I guess we've exhausted that subject [laughter].

A.113:  [Laughter].

B.114:  Well, who do you think's going to run for President next year, since you're
up on all your news?

A.115:  [Noise] {like whine}.

B.116:  Guess we've got Bush again, but [laughter].

A.117:  Yeah, uh, I don't know who's going to run on the Democrat side.

B.118:  Right.

A.119:  Um, uh,

B.120:  Patrick Buchanan supposedly was thinking of running against Bush, or he
just announced today.

A.121:  Is that right?

B.122:  I don't know if he's announced or he's thinking about it, but it was on the
news.

A.123:  Huh.  Well that's kind of a futile effort, probably wouldn't, wouldn't you
think.

B.124:  Well I would think but --

A.125:  Yeah.

B.126:  -- it might scare Bush a little.
