=============================================================================

A.1:  All right.  I guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how
we keep up on current events, and if we're --

B.2:  Right.

A.3:  -- satisfied with, with the, uh --

B.4:  That's,

@A.5:  -- coverage that we receive.

B.6:  Right.

A.7:  Um, thinking about it, some of the ways I try and keep up on current
events is, uh, I enjoy reading the newspaper, but, uh, quite often don't have
time to read all of the newspaper, and so, uh, I enjoy watching some of the T
V highlights and also, uh, some of the news periodicals, uh, weekly magazines,
and, uh, at work I also have, uh, management summary reports that, uh, give
basically a lot of the current events.  Uh, how about yourself?

B.8:  Well, I'm like you.  I don't, I don't, I like to read the paper but I
basically don't do it every day,

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  and I, um, I usually watch, uh, either GOOD MORNING, AMERICA or the
TODAY SHOW, every morning --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- while I'm, you know, whatever I'm doing, I watch that.  I usually watch
the news, either at, you know, early evening or at ten o'clock --

A.13:  Right, right.

B.14:  -- so I get it from T V a lot.  I get TIME MA-, I read TIME MAGAZINE
[lipsmack].  Um, that's one I read pretty regularly.

A.15:  Oh, yeah.  #Okay.#

B.16:  #And, uh.#

A.17:  You think that that's, uh, pretty adequate coverage and you get.

B.18:  The thing about it, you know, now that I've fo-, found, is that we get such
good coverage on T V, or at least such, I don't know, attempted thoroughness
--

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- of coverage, by the time you get the TIME MAG-, MAGAZINE,

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  there's nothing in it you don't know.

A.23:  It's historic events, huh.

B.24:  Right.  Then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or
something, because really, I've thought lately, there's nothing new in the
TIME MAGAZINE.

A.25:  Oh, okay.

B.26:  You know, it's, it's, basically you've heard everything --

A.27:  Yes.

B.28:  -- and, uh, you might, you might get a little more thorough, uh, account of
something, but really, um, I don't know.  So I get most of mine from
television --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- I would say.

A.31:  Um, I found out too, that, uh, quite often if I see something on television
that I want more in-depth, uh, understanding or, or get, want to know more
about it, that the, the newspaper or, uh, I read NEWSWEEK, can give you a
better and more thorough coverage of what I've heard on T V, but, uh, um, I
found out that also on, on T V that you can scan through a whole lot of
different things on C N N and, and like you said, the, the news shows that
are, that are happening, and you can read some more about it if you want to.
Um, I found out, though that, or I feel that a lot of the stuff on T V and the
newspapers is negative.  There's an awful lot of negative news or bad news,
or, or bad news.  And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good
news.

B.32:  Right --

A.33:  And, uh.

B.34:  -- and I, I think there's an attempt to do that.  You know, I think people,
there's a mild attempt for that, but I think basically, we basically associate
news with bad news --

A.35:  Yes, we do.

B.36:  -- or, or catastrophes or problems or crises, or, uh, you know.  I think
our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen.  It's more negative,
like you said.

A.37:  True, true.

B.38:  But, I think people try to, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good
stuff, but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't sway the vote.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  I've heard an interes-, interesting comment also that, uh, with
budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news
media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh,
investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues, but that takes time,
that takes an awful lot of money and commitment, and, and quite often it's a
lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance
chasing --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire
department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to
going out and finding good things, so.  I don't know, I guess the economy is,
is effecting also the news media --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- and we have to pay that price, but, uh, I don't know, I don't know.
It's interesting, and I think that nowadays with communications the way they
are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur --

B.44:  Right.

A.45:  -- all over the world, like the,

B.46:  You know, the war last winter was certainly a good example of that --

A.47:  Exactly.  #We saw,#

B.48:  -- #because we saw# every single thing, practically.

A.49:  Yes, you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been
able to have that privilege or, or luxury to, to view that.  So.

B.50:  I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered.  I
remember watching the World Series during the earthquake,

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  and just seeing that happen --	

A.53:  Oh, yes.

B.54:  -- I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake
--

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- and the, and the announcers, you know grabbing,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  I mean, it's like, that was just something --

A.59:  Oh, yeah.

B.60:  -- because that was like live and real --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- like you said, and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with
tele-,
