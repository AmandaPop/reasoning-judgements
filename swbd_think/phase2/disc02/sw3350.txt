A.1:  What basketball team are you --

B.2:  Well

A.3:  -- most familiar with?

B.4:  Well, pretty, pretty familiar with, we moved here about six months ago, or
a year ago, so I'm pretty familiar with the Mavericks.

A.5:  Yeah, where'd you move from?

B.6:  [Throat_clearing] North Carolina.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Well, yeah the Mavericks, uh, have done fairly well in the past,
but doesn't look like they're going to do too good this year.

B.8:  Nope, not, doesn't look like,

A.9:  May-, maybe they'll surprise us, though, reckon?

B.10:  Yeah, that would be a big [child_talking] surprise.

A.11:  Would be a big su-, [laughter].

B.12:  Yeah, do you, do you follow basketball?

A.13:  Oh, I kind of follow [child_yelling] it a little bit.  I'm not a great fan
of it.  But, uh, you know, I read a little bit about it, and follow it on the
radio, and everything, but, uh, I was glad to see them get rid of that guy,

B.14:  Tarpley [sniffing].

A.15:  Tarpley, although by far the best player they've ever had, I guess.

B.16:  Yeah, I think he, I think he, he was.  I, I think it went on, went on too
long [/child_yelling].  You want to get her out of here?

A.17:  Yeah, it did, it did.  And, and they had to do, they had to get rid of him.

B.18:  [Sniffing].

A.19:  But I couldn't believe they'd given him a contract like they had where that
they couldn't get rid of him.

B.20:  Yeah, well, they al-, he already had, uh, two strikes against him when they
gave him that contract [sniffing].

A.21:  I guess they felt like that was enough, you know, uh, if that, you know,
if, if they had to get out of it they could, and they wouldn't want out of it
unless he did something wrong.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  If he did that, well, that'd cancel the contract, I guess.

B.24:  No, that's true, that right.  If you get the third strike they can break
the contract --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- and if doesn't you want to pay him that much money because he's that
good.

A.27:  Yes, that's right --

B.28:  Yeah, that makes sense.

A.29:  -- he'd be worth it.  Yeah, he'd be worth it.

B.30:  Uh --

A.31:  But (( )).

B.32:  -- did you, uh, see the score of their first game, against San Antonio,

A.33:  Oh, they got blasted, didn't they?  

B.34:  Yeah, they lost by, uh, forty or fifty points.  

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  Hundred and, uh,

A.37:  That was unbelievable,

B.38:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.

A.39:  I, I hadn't seen that score, I just heard somebody talking about they'd
gotten beat real bad.  And, uh, but I think they did better last night,
though, didn't they.

B.40:  Yeah, they lost in overtime by a point or two.

A.41:  Yeah, so that was a good game, I guess.

B.42:  Yep.

A.43:  [Noise] I, I really don't follow them that closely.  Although there was a
[/noise] good article today in the, in the SUNDAY MAGAZINE about, uh, Brad
Davis.

B.44:  Oh, yeah?

A.45:  Did you read that?

B.46:  Nope.

A.47:  Course,

B.48:  Nope.  What did it say?

A.49:  Well, it just, 

B.50:  [Cough]. 

A.51:  uh, this is going to be his last year, but, it just, you know, he just
been, it's amazing that he's one of the original Mavericks, you know, still
playing.

B.52:  Um, yeah, I don't think I was aware of that he was an original Maverick.

A.53:  He is the, 

B.54:  [Sniffing].

A.55:  only original Maverick, yeah, [noise] he started out with them when they
started, and has [/noise] made, just to make the team every year, so,

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  So, and, you know, you don't, you don't make the team if you're not any
good.

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  So, he's done well.  Six hundred thousand a year.

B.60:  Is that right?  That's what he makes?

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  [Throat_clearing].

A.63:  And he's worth it.

B.64:  [Throat_clearing] Well, how do you think they'll finish this year?

A.65:  Huh.

B.66:  Not too good, I imag-, what do you thin-,

A.67:  No, I don't see how that, no, they won't even --

B.68:  They don't, they won't,

A.69:  -- they won't even come close to the playoffs, [noise] I don't think.

B.70:  Um, I don't think so [/noise].  They're, now they're aiming, they're
wishfully hoping, I mean, they've lowered their sites from playoff to maybe
five hundred --

A.71:  Yeah, yeah.

B.72:  -- which, and that's probably a pretty big stretch.

A.73:  That's a big stretch probably, yeah, and, uh, but boy, they, you know,
they've had some darn good teams in the past.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  I guess that's why it's so hard to swallow, you know, right off the bat
they started doing well.

B.76:  Yeah, how do they, you kind of wonder how they let themselves get to where
they have such an old team.

A.77:  Yeah, it makes you, they've had some coach problems over the years, uh
[noise].  Motta was probably the best they've ever had, or ever will [/noise]
have, but he, I don't know, he just, he was such a hot head that he just quit
one time.

B.78:  Oh, yeah.

A.79:  And man, once he made up his mind to do something like that, he gone, he
don't change his mind.  But he was by far I think the best coach they ever
had.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  But he couldn't get along with Aguilar.

B.82:  With who?

A.83:  [Noise] I mean Aguirre.

B.84:  Oh, Aguirre [sniffing].

A.85:  Yeah, Aguirre --

B.86:  [Sniffing] [throat_clearing]  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- and, uh, [/noise] he, he had a hot temper.  

B.88:  Yeah, I haven't followed them too close until, uh, we moved, we moved here.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  I, you know, remember seeing them in the play offs --

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  -- a couple of years ago, I guess.

A.93:  Yeah, probably, yeah, at least two years ago or longer.

B.94:  Yeah,

A.95:  But they did, they used to have some darned good teams.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  But, uh, I've always been a, and I don't follow basketball that closely,
but I've always been a Celtics fan, because I love to watch Larry Bird play.

B.98:  Uh-huh [throat_clearing].  Yeah, I watching the Celtics play.  They're, uh,
they play, uh, have played a good brand of basketball.  It's real teamwork
brand.

A.99:  Always, you can always count on playing a good brand of basketball, and, of
course so can (( )).  So can you depend on the Lakers for doing that.

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  But, I don't know, I just always liked ole, ole Bird.  He just can do
things that [laughter] I don't think humans are supposed to be able to do with
a basketball --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- him and Magic Johnson, and ole Jordan.  But we'll have to keep our
fingers crossed, I guess, for the ole Mavericks.

B.104:  Yeah, take at least that.  

A.105:  Well, and they got a, they got a good owner, I mean, he's willing to spend
the bucks to get what they need, so I think it's just a, just a matter of time
until they, it may take them a couple of years.

B.106:  [Throat_clearing]  Well, I imagine it will, they're down to, I mean, like
their top, there's, four of their starting five are like over, you know
thirty-three, thir-, --

A.107:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.108:  -- so.  

A.109:  And that, that's,

B.110:  You're talking, you're talking about pretty well having to rebuild from
scratch.

A.111:  Yeah, that's just too old for a basketball team.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  Man, old Larry,
