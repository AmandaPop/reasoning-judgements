=====================================================================

A.1:   Now then, what is your idea on what to serve for a dinner
party? 

@B.2:   Oh.  I don't know.  I, I personally don't throw a lot of dinner
parties per se.  Um, 

A.3:   Well, if you were just going to have company what would,  

B.4:   Uh, generally if I'm going to have company, something fairly
easy for me to fix.  

A.5:   [Laughter]. 

B.6:   You know, nobody wants to go to too much work [cough]. 
Probably say, uh, [lipsmack] you know, if it's more than say four
or five people probably like a, a, a fish dish or something or, or
a, a pasta, pasta dish.  

A.7:   Well, what kind of a, what pasta dishes?  What is your
specialty in pasta?  

B.8:   [Lipsmack] Um, generally, uh, the homemade pasta.  The wide
whatever they call that stuff.  

A.9:   Do-,

B.10:   The wider homemade pastas.  

A.11:   Yeah.  Do you make your own?  

B.12:   Yes.  

A.13:   Oh, that must be interesting.  

B.14:   It, uh, it's fairly easy.  You just make the dough in the old
((cuisine)) art and roll it out.  And there's a, it's got a special
machine that you, you roll it out and then it cuts it also and hang
it over the drying rack.  

A.15:   Okay [breathing].  Do you ever, um, since we are coming into
the holiday season, do you ever do desserts?  

B.16:   Um, actually about the only dessert I, I generally fix is some
form of pie or a buttermilk pound cake.  I, those are the only kind
of desserts I really like messing with.  Any, anything more
difficult than that is, is generally a pain to me.  I, I just don't
like to take that much time and stand around and do it.  

A.17:   Do you, um, [lipsmack] do you care for the fruitcake?  

B.18:   No.  

A.19:   Not at all?  

B.20:   I, I, I can, I can stand about a piece a year, one piece of it
a year, but I, I don't like to just eat it.  It's, 

A.21:   Oh, okay.  I have come up on a recipe several years ago that
is th-, now I don't care for fruitcake, 

B.22:   #Uh-huh.# 

A.23:   #period.#  

B.24:   #Yeah.# 

A.25:   #And# this one is absolutely, [lipsmack] it's so easy and it
is so wonderful.  Everyone I serve it to that does not even care
for fruitcake wants the recipe.  

B.26:   I, uh, it's, it's, it's kind of funny I, I don't think I've
ever met anybody that actually likes fruitcake.  

A.27:   Oh, my older daughter does.  Oh, she just thinks it's
wonderful and we always provided her with one.  

B.28:   Yeah.  

A.29:   But this is one can of Eagle Brand, a pound of nuts, a pound
of cherr-, uh, candied cherries, and a pound of something else in
the candied fruits.  

B.30:   Uh-huh.  

A.31:   Mix that up, put it in, spray a pan, loaf pan, pour it into
the pan and cook it at two hundred and twenty-five degrees --

B.32:   Yeah.  

A.33:   -- for about, about an hour.  

B.34:   Huh.  

A.35:   And it's, it is wonderful.  That doesn't have all that
((Citrine)) in it, and I think that is what the, uh, people are so
opposed to with, with the fruitcake.  
 
B.36:   Yeah.  

A.37:   But maybe sometime when you have nothing better to do you
would like to try that one.  

B.38:   Okay.  

A.39:   So,  

B.40:   [Throat_clearing]. 

@@A.41:   what more need we talk about this morning?

B.42:   Um, I can't hardly think of much.  

A.43:   Have you enjoyed this, um, switchboard conversations or is
this your first one?   

B.44:   I've, I've done several of them.  It's, it's, it's all right. 
It's, you know, it's not like an-, anything disastrous or you don't
have to go to a lot of trouble to do it.  

A.45:   No.  That, the way I feel about it and I have talked with some
very interesting people, [lipsmack] so I hope you have a wonderful
holiday, both of them.  And, uh, take care.  

B.46:   Okay.  Thank you.  

A.47:   Thank you.   

B.48:   #Bye-bye.# 

A.49:   #Bye-bye.#
