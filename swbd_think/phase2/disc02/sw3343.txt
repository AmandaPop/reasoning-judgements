=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  When they first said the subject, my mind went kind of blank.  I
thought, Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time.

@B.2:  Well, I haven't either, uh, I, I hate returning things.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what
size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know,
take everything back again [laughter].

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  It's, you know, it's a game to her, but I, I do not like to do that
[laughter].  I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time.  And so I'm usually,
uh, pretty careful when I shop --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know,
if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features
in it that I want.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  [Child_whining] Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a
[/child_whining] Dustbuster Plus --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- that we bought, and we've had it for a while, but all of a sudden it
just wasn't working, and it looks like there's a part missing from it.  My
husband opened it up and whatever, and of course we don't have the receipt any
more, so we can't take it back [laughter].

A.13:  Of course, [laughter] uh-huh.

B.14:  Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long --

A.15:  Right --

B.16:  -- uh,

A.17:  -- right, just to get you by five years and then you'll throw it away
rather than have it fixed --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.

B.20:  Well, that's true, and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get
something fixed --

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  -- that you almost [breathing] are just as well off buying another one --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- you know, if it's, 

A.25:  And you usually get what you pay for.  We bought some walkie-talkies a
couple of years ago for Christmas, and they were like ten dollars, and we
expected them [laughter] to work nice for the little kids, and they didn't
work --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- worth anything [laughter].  So we took those back, and that's about that
all that [laughter] were taken back in ages.

B.28:  Well, yeah, I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand, I, you, I think there's, there
can be a lemon in anything --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- but, uh, I think more often than not, you, you pretty well know what
you're getting ahead of time, and, uh --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too
much of a problem with it, I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have
declared a lemon under the lemon law --

A.35:  Oh, really.

B.36:  -- which is --

A.37:  It's hard.

B.38:  -- extremely difficult to do.  We never could get it [laughter] declared a
lemon, and the car would go and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be
going down the freeway at sixty and it would stop --

A.39:  Oh, wow.

B.40:  -- and I, there was just, you know, and, oh, we went round and round with
the manufacturer and, and everything, and they got it finally semifixed, but
it was such a hassle --

A.41:  Uh-huh, and it just pertained to that [laughter].

B.42:  -- yeah, yeah it, it really is, uh, but, gee, [laughter] this is, of all
the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest
one.

A.43:  [Laughter]  I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what,
mainly what I buy, it seems like, and, uh, you know, I still don't have any,
anything to do there, but,

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either
because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one, so.

B.46:  Well, I think that's true, and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a
warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years,
nothing should go wrong with it.

A.47:  Yeah, my husband is really good at fixing things, too, so he usually, be
able to fix anything that's minor, and --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and that has saved us [laughter] thousands of dollars, you know, from 
(( )) to mechanic to --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- anything like that --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- but, but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them
better or not, I, it's hard to say.  Some, I think they more of their parts
plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the
technology is better.

B.54:  Ye-, I think technology is better, I'm, I'm not sure.  I think --

A.55:  About quality.

B.56:  -- you've got a good point with the plastic and that.  I don't think
necessarily that, things are being made better --

A.57:  Right.

B.58:  -- uh, you know, I, I, everything is so automated, uh, and things can be
made without, [laughter] I think --

A.59:  Yeah,

B.60:  -- a human hand ever touching it, you know --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- an awful lot of things, and I think that certainly makes a difference
from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know,
had some pride in it.

A.63:  Right.  Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you
know, for a handcrafted something, so --

B.64:  Well, yeah, that's --

A.65:  -- so.

B.66:  -- that's true.

A.67:  So, if we get what we [laughter] what we deserve [laughter].

B.68:  Yeah, well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell [child_crying] stuff
at shows and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as
far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.
