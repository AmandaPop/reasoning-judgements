=========================================================================

A.1:   So, what kind of a house do you live in?  

B.2:   I'm in a, uh, in a ranch.  A, uh, it was about, uh, sixteen
hundred square feet when I bought it, and, uh, it's about two
thousand square feet now, but it's one of those typical,
[breathing] uh, ranches that you find around here.  Oh, it's, uh,
built in the, probably built in the late fifties so it's not, um,
what you would find, uh, where you live.  But, uh, for the older,
uh, ranch homes it's pretty typical I guess.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  Well, our home is, uh, probably, for our area it's
probably one of the lower income homes out here.  [laughter]  Uh,
most of the, the homes that they're building, well, I shouldn't say
all of them, but most of them now are up in the millions of
dollars.  

B.4:   Really?  

A.5:   Oh yeah, there's,

B.6:   How many square feet do you have?  

A.7:   We have got about, uh, twenty, I'd say about twenty-four
hundred.  

B.8:   Four bedrooms?  

A.9:   Uh, we've got five bedrooms, 

B.10:   Five bedrooms.  

A.11:   because we built onto our garage.  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   A, a bedroom for my mother, and, uh,

B.14:   I made a, I made a fourth bedroom out of, uh, a made a fourth
bedroom out of one of our, out of our living room and then added a,
uh, what we call a sunroom -- 

A.15:   Oh.  

B.16:   -- to get the, you know, when, when we added four hundred
square feet to our house -- 

A.17:   Oh, that's great.  

B.18:   -- so that,

A.19:   Well, this, this house is very comfortable.  We've got two
living areas and that, that's the thing I probably like the most
about it.  

B.20:   How many stories?  Just one?  

A.21:   It's just one story.  Yeah.  It's a Fox and Jacobs home.  

B.22:   How are they built?  

A.23:   Um, we've been real happy with it.  

B.24:   Yeah.  I've heard that, I've heard the construction is pretty
good on Fox and Jacobs.  

A.25:   Of course, I'm not a carpenter or anything like that.  They
could probably come in and say, gee, this is not straight and this
is under something but,

B.26:   But I mean it doesn't give you trouble?  

A.27:   No.  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   No, we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all.

B.30:   No cracked slab or anything like that?  

A.31:   No.  

B.32:   {Very faint}  All right.

A.33:   We've been real lucky.  So,

B.34:   And is it, um, a natural gas and,

A.35:   Yeah.  

B.36:   You know what I miss though?  Basements.  

A.37:   Oh, yeah.  

B.38:   I sur-, I sure wish they could build basements in homes in
Texas.  

A.39:   Yeah, I, I've heard a lot of people say that.  That's for
sure.  Uh, we have an attic that we've just put, you know, plywood
ove-, over the beams and things up in the attic and so that, 

B.40:   So you,

A.41:  has replaced it to some extent but certainly not,

B.42:   Can you stand up in it?  

A.43:   Uh, in parts.  I mean you couldn't, you really couldn't use it
for a room.  

B.44:   So you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical
around here.  

A.45:   Yes.  

B.46:   Th-, ours is pitched so shallow that you, uh, don't get much
room in the attic.  

A.47:   Yeah.  Yeah, we, uh, we've got, you know, I'll store all our
Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there.  

B.48:   So, five bedrooms and two living, two family t-,

A.49:   Two living areas.  We have a living room and dining room at
the front of the house, 

B.50:   Uh-huh.  

A.51:  and then we have a, the, uh, family room, kitchen, and
playroom  -- 

B.52:   Uh-huh. 

A.53:   -- at the rear of the house which has been really nice.  In
fact, I really enjoy the playroom that, y-, you would think that
would not be a real bonus, you know, to a house, but of all the
rooms in the house I'd say that was, that was the one that's been
really nice to have [laughter]. 

B.54:   Isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the
house most of the time.  

A.55:   I think that's true.  

B.56:   [Laughter]  You c-, 

A.57:   Yeah.  Probably our family room is the, the biggest.  Uh,

B.58:   Right.  Some people, I mean, families seem to migrate towards
one, one room and carry on most of their activities there, and, uh,
uh, some rooms, we have one room that we never use.  

A.59:   Yeah.  

B.60:   I mean might as well not even heat and cool it.  

A.61:   Yeah.  

B.62:   Strange.  

A.63:   Well, that's kind of the way our living room and dining room
is, 

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:  but it is nice to have it because there's, uh, with our size
of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight
and clean if you have [laughter] someone come --

B.66:   Right, right.  

A.67:   -- just on the spur of the moment.  

B.68:   Uh-huh.  

A.69:   So [lipsmack],

B.70:   So you've been fairly happy with it.  How long have you been
in it?  

A.71:   Seventeen years.  

B.72:   Wow.  Boy, it doesn't seem that long but it is because we, uh,
came to this area about the same time [laughter]. 

A.73:   Uh-huh.  

B.74:   We've been fifteen, fifteen years in the, in the house that
we're living in.  

A.75:   Oh, wow.  

B.76:   And we, the, the principal feature I like about ours is that
it's pier and beam.  

A.77:   Oh, uh-huh.  

B.78:   Yours is a slab I assume.  

A.79:   Yes, it is.  

B.80:   Yeah, ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under
it and do a whole lot of different things that I could not have
done if it was slab.  

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   I've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work
that, [throat_clearing] by myself and saved a lot of money that I
couldn't have done if the house was on a slab.  

A.83:   Well, that's interesting.  

B.84:   But that's because it's so old.  

A.85:   Yeah.  

B.86:   It's thirty-five, thirty-six years old when they used to build
like that, and, uh,

A.87:   Uh-huh.  Well, my husband wouldn't do that anyway.  [laughter]
That's his, that's his, 

B.88:   I know, he's not a handy, right?  [laughter].

A.89:  worst thing in [laughter] life is to have to repair something.

B.90:   I, on the other hand, se-,

A.91:   So,

B.92:  uh, do a lot too much of it and, uh, I've gotten good at it which in a, in
a way is bad because then you, uh, you start to take pleasure in it
[laughter].

A.93:   Well, uh, that's great.  We just kind of save everything for
when ((Al)), uh, for, for when his Dad comes to visit and then he
does all the repairing, you know, he does [laughter],

B.94:   Right.  My Dad is actually, uh,
