========================================================================

A.1:  Well, Robin.

B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  Um, I do have a P C --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- in my home.

B.6:  I don't have it at home, but I used one at work --

A.7:  Used one at work.

B.8:  -- and I play on there [laughter]. 

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  But I do, I do some of my own stuff --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- on there too, so.

A.13:  What do you use it for as far as your own work?

B.14:  Um, oh, games mostly.  Um, data base like address lists and recipes and --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- just, uh, sort of the stuff that I like to keep track of.  Mostly, most
of what I do is shareware games, and, and copies of stuff that I've gotten
from other people.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  I use Lotus a lot just because I like [laughter] using Lotus [laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Do your kids ever get to use it at work?

B.20:  Uh, no, because they're two and four, so --

A.21:  Two and four.

B.22:  -- they're not quite old enough to use it yet,

A.23:  Yeah, not there yet, yeah.

B.24:  I tell them mommy is playing on the computer, so,

A.25:  [Laughter].

B.26:  They know what I'm doing --

A.27:  Yeah.  But,

B.28:  -- [Sniffing] but at work I use it mostly for, I, most of what I do is in
Lotus.  I, we've got a couple of word processing, but, I'd rather use Lotus
[laughter] --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- I know it better [laughter].

A.31:  Know it better than that, yeah.  I think everyone knows it better than --

B.32:  [Lipsmack] Uh, yeah.

A.33:  -- custom word proc-,

B.34:  Well, we've got Wordstar Two Thousand, we just got WordPerfect, and I
haven't gotten around to learning WordPerfect yet, so.

A.35:  Yeah, well, I use WordPerfect at work, uh, pretty much exclusively.

B.36:  Yeah, it's, I like, well, I work for the R T C, so we, that's what,
everything they send us is in WordPerfect, so we kind of had to,

A.37:  #Have to use it # --

B.38:  #get WordPerfect.  So.#

A.39:  -- yeah.  Well, I have one at home that, uh, my kids are twelve, eight --

B.40:  Oh.

A.41:  -- and three.  So they use it quite a bit --

B.42:  I bet.

A.43:  -- for games, and the twelve year old uses it, you know, for school --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- uses the word, word processing for school quite a bit really.

B.46:  Well, good, yeah --

A.47:  And, uh,

B.48:  -- that's, that's one thing I'm hoping, but the time mine get up there that
we will be able to have one at home.

A.49:  Yeah.  Now we also, course of I use it for, uh, I have some check 
balancing --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and budgeting --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- software that I use, have for several years now --

B.54:  Huh.

A.55:  -- all my checkbook's been on the computer for --

B.56:  Yeah, that's --

A.57:  -- three years.

B.58:  -- since I work for the R T C, we used to, I used to be the loan 
teller --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- for a failed savings and loan [lipsmack] --

A.61:  Huh.

B.62:  -- and couple of our customers would use the automated check writing --

A.63:  Would they really?

B.64:  -- programs, yeah, and it was, I, it was always interesting to see them, it
was like, Oh, okay [laughter] --

A.65:  Here they go.

B.66:  -- I recognize these.

A.67:  Yeah [laughter].

B.68:  Who would be, I, I guess that would be a pretty good feature to use on
that.

A.69:  Well, I've used it also for tax for about the past --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- four years, I guess it is.

B.72:  That would be good.

A.73:  Makes it real nice, and, uh, I guess that's mainly been it, other than, you
know, like, you know, we use it for games quite a bit.

B.74:  Yeah, I'm kind of hooked on Tetris [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah, I don't have Tetris.  But boy, I'm glad, it's probably a good thing I
don't [laughter].

B.76:  [Laughter]  Well, the shareware version I got has got like six different
versions of Tetris.

A.77:  You got a shareware version, huh. 

B.78:  Uh-huh.  It was like three dollars.  I, I like that, it's, it's pretty
cool.

A.79:  Do you know what it's called?

B.80:  Um --

A.81:  I mean, does it have a,

B.82:  -- it's called Nyet, N Y E T --

A.83:  N,

B.84:  -- which is, what is it, oh, something about it's not, not called Tetris --

A.85:  Right.  

B.86:  -- you know, it's like, uh-huh.  And the other version's called Ain't.

A.87:  Ain't --

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  -- because it ain't Tetris [laughter].

B.90:  Well, the, the four letters, I can't remember what they stand for, but it's
a little, can't think of what that thing's called, but it's, it's a four word
phrase that means, no, it's not Tetris --

A.91:  Oh, okay.

B.92:  -- it's really not [laughter].

A.93:  [Laughter] Oh, boy.

B.94:  It's fun, I like that, and plus there's a guy at work that he and I trade
different games, like he's like, Well, what do you have, and I'll give you
this --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- and so we trade, he's given me Jeopardy and Monopoly and Wheel of
Fortune, and,

A.97:  All right, you've got some good ones then.

B.98:  Oh, yeah, the only problem is, the computer I like to play them on that's
got the color monitor also I can't turn the sound off.

A.99:  Oh, you can't turn the sound off, yeah.

B.100:  So, I haven't figured out how to turn the sound off, yet.  It's like, Oh --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- because I, I haven't really been into computers except for about the
last five years.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  Before then, it was like, Get that computer out of here.  I don't want 
it --

A.105:  Right.

B.106:  -- around here, leave me alone.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  But I've, I've gotten to where, I took a basic programming course out at
Richland, and I really, I enjoyed that, and I got a little bit further into
programming and I worked with a couple of our programming analysts down at,
uh, Frito-Lay --

A.109:  Right.

B.110:  -- and I thoroughly enjoyed that, and now it's like, Give me computer --

A.111:  Huh.

B.112:  -- and consequently I am the person that everybody comes to, at work.

A.113:  How about that --

B.114:  It's [laughter].

A.115:  -- isn't that amazing.

B.116:  Oh, it's, it really is, it's like, um, amazing how this turned around
[laughter].  She used to hate it and now she loves it.

A.117:  Yeah [laughter].

B.118:  But, I like it --

A.119:  Well, that's good.

B.120:  -- it's fun.  

@@A.121:  Well, do you supposed we've talked long enough?

B.122:  Oh, I guess we have.  

A.123:  All right.

B.124:  That sounds pretty good.

A.125:  Well, I think we've done our duty here, anyway.

B.126:  Yeah, I think so.

A.127:  All right, good to talk to you.

B.128:  Thanks a lot, Vic.

A.129:  Bye-bye.

B.130:  Bye-bye.
