B.1:  Hello.

A.2:  Hi.

B.3:  Hi.

A.4:  My name is, uh, Donna Donahue, and I live in Plano, Texas.

B.5:  Hi.  My name is Lowell, and I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.

A.6:  Oh, okay.  Um, do you want to start or should I start?

@B.7:  Go right ahead.

A.8:  Okay, um, I would say that our home is a very typical home for the area
that we live in.  We have, um, three children, and, um, they attend the public
school here and are very active in a lot of the sports, soccer and baseball
and, well, my little girl goes to tap dance, and my little one goes to
preschool and, um, I'm home with the children, just do a lot of running
around.  It seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type, I
don't know, life.  Um, what about you?  [Laughter].

B.9:  I'm, I'm single, and I, I live in a town home --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- here in Raleigh, and --

A.12:  Uh-huh.

B.13:  -- it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area --

A.14:  Okay.

B.15:  -- ther-, we, we have a lot of town homes here --

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  -- as well as single family homes, and at the time that I bought this one
it was just a, a much better arrangement for me personally.  I'm not home a
lot.  I travel a great deal with --

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  -- my job, and [breathing] so it was easier to have a home that didn't --

A.20:  Was sort of maintenance free.

B.21:  -- exactly --

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  -- that somebody else looks out for the maintenance.

A.24:  Oh yeah, well, um, that, that sounds, that sounds pretty good for I know
my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends, not so much now, but
to, um, maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds, and it's a lot
of work, owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it.  It's --

B.25:  It certainly is.

A.26:  -- sometimes I think, um, it would be nice to have a town home, with
[laughter] not having all that responsibility.

B.27:  Well, if you ever get one, be sure the walls are good and thick because if
they're not you can hear.  I, that's the main thing when I was shopping for
one, I wanted to make sure I could, I couldn't hear my neighbors and that was
--

A.28:  Right.

B.29:  -- so I bought one that's more like living in a, once you're inside, you
don't know you're in a town home.

A.30:  Oh, that sounds lovely.

B.31:  It is.  They're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by
side --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.

A.34:  Uh-huh.  So in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career
type people that have those type homes and --

B.35:  Yes, definitely.

A.36:  -- uh-huh, and, um, the area that we're settled in is, um, definitely
young, young families with, with kids.  They're still doing, um, a lot of
building in the neighborhood.  So the people that move here seem to move from
all over the country, which we're from, um, the northeast, and, um,
[child_talking] seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family
around.  So it, um, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of
relatives visiting your neighbors, and you know, um [laughter].  But, um ((
)),

B.37:  Well, we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of
the, the cold of the northeast so --

A.40:  Right, right.

B.41:  -- they settle sort of in-between.

A.42:  Uh-huh.  Now it's, um, is it very wooded around where you are, there lots
of pretty trees and,

B.43:  Yes --

A.44:  Yeah.

B.45:  -- as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that I live
in is very wooded.

A.46:  Oh, how pretty.

B.47:  It is nice.

A.48:  I do miss that.  Around here in Plano there are very few trees and it's
pretty flat and, and kind of barren and that's the only thing that we don't
like about living in Texas, is we miss all the beautiful trees and the Fall
and, and, um, uh, the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is,
you know, in the north.  Um, or even where you are.

B.49:  Uh, we definitely have a lot of trees here.

A.50:  [Laughter] A lot of leaves to rake up too, I bet.  

B.51:  Yes but fortunately the home owner's association does all that.

A.52:  Does that, well, see, that's another plus.

B.53:  Yes, I don't have to worry about that and this is the time of year we're
starting to lose, they're all falling now.

A.54:  That's right, that's right, they are.  I'm going to get the kids to get
outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that
needs to be done.  We just have a few trees in the front and a few in the
back but, not, not much.  Just, just a little [child_talking] kind of just in
more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks and if you didn't do
anything about it, then they'd probably the leaves just blow away [laughter].

B.55:  Right.

@@A.56:  It's not too bad.  Okay, do we have to speak for a certain amount of
time?

B.57:  No, I don't think so.

A.58:  Okay.  Okay.  It was really nice speaking to you.

B.59:  It was good to speak with you too.

A.60:  Okay, and have a happy Thanksgiving.

B.61:  Thank you, you too.

A.62:  Bye-bye.

B.63:  Bye-bye.
