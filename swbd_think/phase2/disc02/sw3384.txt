=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Do you work?  

B.2:  Yes, I do.  

A.3:  I think that's the main change.  What do you think?  

B.4:  Well, I think that's a big part of it and I, I think it maybe started
because women wanted outside of the home and,

A.5:  #Right.# 

B.6:  #I# almost think with our society and, and inflation and the cost of things
it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home.

A.7:  That's right.  

B.8:  But, but yeah, I think that's a big change [lipsmack].  I'd like to not
work.  What about you?

A.9:  Well, I've worked all the time up until just about a year ago. 

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  And I just, physically I wasn't able to and I mean, I love my job.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  But I have four children, and that's real hard.   

B.14:  [Gasp]. 

A.15:  You have children?  I assume so.  

B.16:  Yes.  I have two and that's been a big deciding factor because I mean I
never wanted to be a career woman,

A.17:  #Right.# 

B.18:  #but as long# as I wa-, w-, you know, was going to work I was going to do
as, as much as I could,

A.19:  #Right.# 

B.20:  #as well as# I could et cetera.  

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  And I, I wanted to stay home when I had kids.  Well, I have two.  I have a
four year old and a three year old.

A.23:  Oh.  

B.24:  And we would like two more but I, it's like, we talked.  Uh, I don't want
two more unless I can quit and stay home and take care,

A.25:  #Right.# 

B.26:  #of them which is,# 

A.27:  #Oh.# 

B.28:  #something right now# financially it takes both people to work.

A.29:  It's real hard.  

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  It's real hard.  I mean even I, 

B.32:  It's full time work.  

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  It was so hard for me to work full time.  

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  Of course, my kids are, are a little older but then you, then you give up
the money.

B.38:  Yeah.   

A.39:  You know?  

B.40:  You do there's sa-, of course, you know, everything you give up something
but I just, I, the kids are so wonderful [laughter].

A.41:  Yeah.  #(( )).#

B.42:  #But I do# think that's one of the major changes.  You know, my mama I
remember her being home --

A.43:  Yep.  

B.44:  -- uh, 

A.45:  #((Fine)).# 

B.46:  #you know,# she made breakfast in the morning for us.  

A.47:  Yep.  #I know.#  

B.48:  #And if# she worked it was part time and it was work that was done while we
were maybe at school, and she was there when we got home.

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  #You know, and,#

A.51:  #Well,# I've decided now in fact, I'm just, I'm substitute teachers aid
which is a, afar cry from my travel agent career,

B.52:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.53:  #y-, which I loved.# But I'm, I'm there in the same school as my children,
my two littler ones.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  And I'm home when they are home.  In fact, I've had an offer to just work
the Christmas season at a local jewelry store, and I'm just really hesitating,

B.56:  #Yeah.# 

A.57:  #because# I've, I enjoyed my, the first summer home ever, 

B.58:  #Oh.# 

A.59:  #so like# seventeen years with my kids.   

B.60:  Oh.  

A.61:  I mean, well, I didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent
and it was wonderful.

B.62:  #Yeah.# 

A.63:  #My kids# and I, we just had a ball.  

B.64:  #See, and I think,#

A.65:  #Of course, their,# their ages, they are almost seventeen -- 

B.66:  Oh.  

A.67:  -- fif-, almo-, well, sixteen, fourteen, eleven, and nine
[noise] --

B.68:  Oh.  

A.69:  -- and we are just running every direction #and,#

B.70:  #But see,# it's such an important time to be home.  

A.71:  It is.  

B.72:  You know.  #And that,# 

A.73:  #It is.# 

B.74:  was important to me enough, you know, my husband was raised, uh, his, his
parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked,

A.75:  #Always worked.# 

B.76:  #and he's like# well, you know, what's the big deal about being home,

A.77:  #What, yeah.# 

B.78:  #for your kids.# Well, as our kids are getting older, you know, he sees it
more.  I said, Russ, you don't understand what it was like to have her home or
to if you needed,

A.79:  #Right.# 

B.80:  #Mom# at school, you know, she was there to help or, 

A.81:  #Right.# 

B.82:  #she was# there to take you, and, and I want to be able to do those things
so.

A.83:  I think that, you know, it's good.  You know, sometimes I'll have the
cookies ready when they,

B.84:  #Yeah.# 

A.85:  #come home# and, and a lot of my boys, uh, my older boys' junior high
friends will come over.  In fact, everyday,

B.86:  #[Laughter].# 

A.87:  #I've got boys# hanging around, and it's wonderful [noise].  I'm real close
to the schools and, you know, we are just I, I'm very happy to be staying
home.

B.88:  I think that's wonderful.  

A.89:  But again I miss, 

B.90:  #So, where do you see,# 

A.91:  #the (( )).#  

B.92:  us changing in the future?   

A.93:  I don't. 

B.94:  Well, see that was one of the things s-, the, the question I think is,

A.95:  #I ((keep on working)).  Right.#

B.96:  #you know,# what changes do we see and I'm, I'm not sure I, I see it go
anywhere.  I think they are still going to have to work.

A.97:  That we are because it's so expensive.  If we want, uh, extra clothes, the
extra car, the extra,

B.98:  Right.  

A.99:  [Laughter] The thing is, when a woman does work, then there is the clothes
to buy,

B.100:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.101:  #and then# there is the gas, 

B.102:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.103:  #and then# there is the lunches and then the day care.  

B.104:  #The day care eats,# 

A.105:  #((You must pay for)),# 

B.106:  #me alive.# 

A.107:  #day care.#  Yeah.  

B.108:  You know, I pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty, 

A.109:  #Oh# --

B.110:  #a month# --  

A.111:  -- my gosh.  

B.112:  -- for two kids [laughter].

A.113:  Yeah, for two.  

B.114:  They would eat you,

A.115:  #It's almost hardly worth it for you,# 

B.116:  #alive.#  

A.117:  to work until they get in school.  

B.118:  I know.  

A.119:  Then you work summers unless you are a teacher.  Are you a teacher?

B.120:  No, I'm not,  

A.121:  #(( )).# 

B.122:  #and I# would love, you, you, you talked about having the summers off and I
thought, oh, that would be so wonderful.

A.123:  #(( )).# 

B.124:  #And I# love the little preschool they are in.  It's wonderful.

A.125:  Uh-huh.  

B.126:  You know, so I feel good about them being there but it's still not the
same.

A.127:  No.  It's not the same.  

B.128:  It's just not.  

A.129:  I, I don't see things changing really, and, and it's terrible for divorced
women --

B.130:  Uh-huh.   

A.131:  -- you know, who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college
education.  Thank goodness I have mine, and I could get a real good paying
job,

B.132:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.133:  #if I wanted# to, you know, d-, in fact, I still have offers, you know,
please come back,

B.134:  #Please come back to work.# 

A.135:  #((and we'll pay you this)).#

B.136:  Sure.  

A.137:  Yeah, yeah.  And it's been a real tough decision but I'm very happy to be
here with my kids.  My kids, we've seen a remarkable difference in,

B.138:  #That's wonderful.# 

A.139:  #((now)) that# I'm home.  

B.140:  That's wonderful.  

A.141:  Yeah.  I'm real, and I'm, but I've been doing a lot of volunteering at the
schools and playing lots of tennis [laughter].

B.142:  [Laughter] I like that.  

A.143:  Yeah, yeah.  ((I know)).

B.144:  Well, we're working on it.  I'm hoping in about three to five years I'll be
able to stay home and my kids, of course, will be in school then but I'll,

A.145:  #((Right)).# 

B.146:  #be there# mornings, I'll be there noons,

A.147:  #Yeah.# 

B.148:  #I'll be# there afternoons and all.  I feel like, 

A.149:  #Well,# 

B.150:  #that's good# and I can work part days in my husband's business, you know,
so that,

A.151:  #Oh, that would be great.# 

B.152:  #he can afford for us to do that,# you know.  

A.153:  Right.  I think the, the other thing that, that has changed for woman
because we are working is we are having less children.
