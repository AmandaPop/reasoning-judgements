==========================================================================

B.1:  I don't know what you drive now.  I mean, what do you drive now?

A.2:  Uh, I have a Ford pickup and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan.

B.3:  Oh, okay.

A.4:  And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen [sniffing]
so, uh --

B.5:  Throw them in the back.

A.6:  -- they sort of fit our requirement.  Yeah, I have a, one of those, uh,
pickups with the, uh, #seat# --

B.7:  #Cab.#

A.8:  -- with a seat in the back.

B.9:  Oh, yeah?

A.10:  And so they just fit in there.  When they get to be teenagers with long
legs, it may not work.

B.11:  #Yeah [laughter].#

A.12:  #Right now,# I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we
have room and, uh --

B.13:  There you go.

A.14:  -- and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back and I kind
of like having a pickup truck.

B.15:  #Yeah, yo-,# 

A.16:  #Actually,# I think of it as a [throat_clearing], as a car that'll last
#[laughter].#

B.17:  #Right,# yeah, I know.

A.18:  I like the way trucks are built and I don't care about comfort.  So, I'm
#pretty happy.#

B.19:  #Yeah, you're# looking at, I got a Toyota Four Runner.  I wanted a truck
that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too, so I got
a Four Runner.

A.20:  So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one.  I, I never buy new so I
wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.

B.21:  [Laughter] You're just like me.  I've never bought a new vehicle in my
life.

A.22:  [Throat_clearing] And, uh, yeah, I don't, I don't need to pay for the
glitz.  I'll --

B.23:  No.

A.24:  -- let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine (( )) and I'll #pay for
the rest of it.#

B.25:  #[Laughter]#  Let somebody else break it in, right [noise].

A.26:  Right.  And, uh, the van we're sor-, we might go again on a, on a van.  We,
we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a
compact in a sedan next time.  I'm not sure.

B.27:  Yeah.  

A.28:  We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years #but, uh,#

B.29:  #[Laughter].#

A.30:  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon --

B.31:  Right.

A.32:  -- [Throat_clearing] and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my
second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.

B.33:  Right.

A.34:  And, uh, th-, it certainly had that.  We didn't do much to it at all.

B.35:  Yeah.  

A.36:  So.

B.37:  Yeah, my, my, (( )) pretty much the same.  I, I got a, like I ((say)) I got
one of those Toyota Four Runners --

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  -- and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to.  I mean, it, it'll
tow three thousand pounds so I can tow everything and it, I can throw, I've
had eleven people in it before [laughter].

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  Believe it or not.  And, uh, it's real reliable, belie-, I, I mean I've had
it for almost four years now and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never
had anything [laughter] wrong with it.

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  And then, of course, two weeks ago,

A.44:  [Throat_clearing].

B.45:  it decided, I don't know, it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world,
but it blew a head gasket.

A.46:  Uh-oh.

B.47:  Didn't do any damage to it.  #Uh, I caught# --

A.48:  #How, at how# --

B.49:  -- it real early.

A.50:  -- at how many miles?

B.51:  Uh, oh ninety-seven --

A.52:  Huh.

B.53:  -- thousand.  So it's not real early [laughter].

A.54:  You didn't overheat it?

B.55:  No.  Never overheated it.  I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the
coolant [sniffing].

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  Went out and looked.  Saw it was, saw where it was coming from.  Drove it
right to the shop [laughter] and left it off.

A.58:  Huh.  #Well that was, (( )),#

B.59:  #And that was it# because I, d-, I have that and then I have a, a Kawasaki
motorcycle.

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I
can take it and it's not raining.

A.62:  Yeah.

B.63:  [Laughter] I mean that's, that's sort of my,

A.64:  [Throat_clearing].

B.65:  hobby though more than a vehicle.  It, it's a [noise], I don't know, people
who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves
[laughter].

A.66:  I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not
raining and, uh, uh, he's a, it's, he's pretty conservative guy.  I don't
think it's much of a sport for him.  I guess, uh,

B.67:  I know but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.  

A.68:  I'm sure he does, yeah.  

B.69:  Yeah.  So, you know, yo-, 

A.70:  [Throat_clearing].

B.71:  h-, [noise] when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just
to, just to go driving?

A.72:  [Laughter].

B.73:  Yeah.

A.74:  No [throat_clearing].

B.75:  And I go out twice a week on the bike, so.  

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  At least.  #Just for# --

A.78:  #((Uh)).#

B.79:  -- the enjoyment.  

A.80:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

B.81:  But, yeah, I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not
necessarily a new car but, a, another car, uh, I would consider going to a, a
non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got.
Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, ju-, just an open bed to
throw stuff in.

A.82:  Right.  #(( )).#

B.83:  #I'm sure,# I'm sure that that's very, I mean you got one.  It's. that's
really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and,

A.84:  If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would
have it off most of the time.

B.85:  Right.

A.86:  I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way
#because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.#

B.87:  #To have it out of the way.  Right.#

A.88:  But, uh, they're solid.  Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,

B.89:  I think they last a lot #longer than anything else.#

A.90:  #[Throat_clearing] They're# the only things Americans still know how to
build and, uh [throat_clearing].

B.91:  Yeah, yeah, the trucks do.  Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little
Jap trucks are, are good there too.  But so are the, though I think the
Chevies, I don't think the Che-, I don't like the Chevies as much as I like
the Fords.

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.

A.94:  Right.  #I# --

B.95:  #At# least until recently [laughter].

A.96:  -- I kind of like mine, yeah, so, mine's a Ford [throat_clearing]. 

B.97:  A friend of mine just bought (( )), bought like a year ago.  It, it's a
really nice truck.  I mean, I don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges
they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.

A.98:  Oh, I heard about that, #yes.#

B.99:  #Oh,# it's beautiful.  

A.100:  #Yeah.#

B.101:  #That thing,# that thing will last #forever ((I mean)),# 

A.102:  #That,# that's a serious truck.

B.103:  Oh, yeah, that thing's, uh, it's got a boat engine in it [laughter].

A.104:  Right, this, uh, I, I know a contractor who just got one of those.

B.105:  Uh-huh.

A.106:  He's pleased with it.
