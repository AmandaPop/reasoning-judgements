============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I don't know.  Do you want to start?

B.2:  Well, I haven't, uh, I haven't thought a lot about g-, government
universal health care.  I've, uh, uh, worked for a, you know, private company
that, that provides, uh, health insurance.  Although I, you know, they're like
many, are, are increasingly working on, uh, cost cutting things su-, so that
at this point I'm not very satisfied with the kind of things that they're
doing.

@A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  They're going to network doctors which doesn't include our, uh, doctors
and, uh --

A.5:  Huh.

B.6:  -- only certain hospitals, well, network hospitals where they will, uh,
same deal as the doctors.  That they will pay a higher percentage and pay more
of the costs with, if you use their particular ones that they've negotiated
with.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  But, uh, uh, I don't like th-, it seems to me that we're g-, that that's
kind of going towards the, the [sigh], socialized medicine in terms of, of not
having a choice in whe-, where or when you want to have, have your health 
care --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- uh, without the government being involved.  It's just a private form of
it, but the same kinds of, of drawbacks I think to it.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  Uh, what about you?  What, what's your situation as far as,

A.13:  Well, uh, I'm a graduate student and --

B.14:  Okay.

A.15:  -- so I get health care through the school.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Uh, so I'm, for health care purposes, I'm a, a state employee.  So we have
the state employees union.  Uh, and we have our choice of like twenty
different plans with, you know, twenty different companies that operate in the
state.  Uh, and, you know, I'm on Blue Cross Blue Shield, uh, I guess it's,
uh, comprehensive.  Uh, and, you know, I end up, I'm paying [laughter] like
five dollars a month --

B.18:  Huh.

A.19:  -- for health care coverage, #you know.#

B.20:  #Uh-huh.#

A.21:  Uh, and then I pay another five dollars for dental.  Uh, so you know, for
someone who's in a huge union like, uh, you know, all #state# --

B.22:  #Yeah.#

A.23:  -- employees, it, it, you know --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- it's kind of, the issue is kind of moot.  But I look at my parents.  My
father's, uh, self-employed.  He's an attorney.  Uh, and --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- right now, I mean, it's just him and two secretaries and he pays out,
uh, what is it, forty-eight hundred dollars a month for health care.

B.28:  [Clicking].

A.29:  For the family and, and the two, uh, secretaries, you know.  It's just --

B.30:  Amazing.

A.31:  -- yeah, it's just, i-, it's, extraordinary, #you know.#

B.32:  #Yeah.#  #Yeah.#

A.33:  #Uh,# and so, you know, I look at my end of it and things aren't too bad
but I, you know, I look at my father's side of things and they're horrible,
you know.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  And I hear a lot of horror stories from other people too.  Uh, you know,
that they have to deal with horrible, uh, you know, P P O -s or H M O -s or
something like that, you know.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  Where you can't choose your own doctor and --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- #and,# --

B.40:  #And,# --

A.41:  -- you know.

B.42:  -- and, uh, you know, i-, uh, the company I work for is bi-, big enough
that they can, then they've got clout but I, you know, feel guilty and resent
a little bit the fact that, that, for instance, yo-, people like your father,
that just leaves them worse off cause the, the health care providers end up
making up what, uh, my employer doesn't pay them --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- uh, by charging more for, uh, other people.

A.45:  Exactly, #yeah.#

B.46:  #You know,# so that, that, that doesn't seem to me to be a fair thing
either.

A.47:  No.

B.48:  And, uh, from, from what I hear, Canada has a, has a really a, a pretty
good system in terms of, of universal government health, uh, insurance,
depending on who you listen to.  While there may or may not be longer waits
than here for some elective surgeries #but# --

A.49:  #Uh-huh.#

B.50:  -- but, uh, in terms of the per person health care that they spend, it,
it's on the order of half as much, uh, as the, as the per capita average in
the United States, I think and, and very nearly comparable service.  And I,
you know, I'm, I'm willing to accept some, e-, e-, some limits in terms of
[sigh], I think it's Oregon that just gone through a, uh, passed a state, uh,
health insurance scheme --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- where they had a commission draw up a very, uh, you know, very detailed
and stringent priority list of what, uh, of, of the, uh, different 
procedures --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and the, and their costs and prioritized in terms of the, of the cost
effectiveness and then just went down the list and said, okay, here's the
cutoff point.  If, if you're below this point, then it, then the, the odds of
it doing you any good versus the costs are just not enough to be, uh,
effective and we'll, uh, we won't pay for those things.

A.55:  Huh, interesting.

B.56:  And, uh, you know, I'm, I'm not,
