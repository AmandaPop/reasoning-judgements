============================================================

A.1:  Okay [children].

B.2:  Okay Carol.  So, air quality.

A.3:  Yeah.  Is it, [noise] {sounds like water running and she is doing dishes} I
know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can
just, you can see it.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  But, then again [throat_clearing] I originally was from California and, uh,
there is a big difference between Texas and California.  #And, uh# --

B.6:  #Surely.#

A.7:  -- they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for
so many hours with an air conditioner.  And, of course, they don't have that
here in Texas so, [breathing] there's ...

B.8:  You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts?

A.9:  No, not in, not in Te-, well not in Dallas, that is.

B.10:  Right.  I, I,

A.11:  [throat_clearing].

B.12:  yeah, I spent a summer i-, i-, in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas
there.

A.13:  Yeah.  We're going there tomorrow.

B.14:  Oh, really #[laughter].#

A.15:  #Uh-huh [laughter].#  #We're# --

B.16:  #Yeah.#

A.17:  -- packing and getting ready to go #((to))#.

B.18:  #Actually,# I'm a California born person.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  I was born in L A so I know what you're talking about.  #In L A, it's
pretty bad.#

A.21:  #Yeah.  Oh, okay.#  Yeah, you do then.  

B.22:  [breathing] Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico
City.

A.23:  Is it really?

B.24:  Yes.  

A.25:  I would not imagine that.

B.26:  The worst one for smog is Mexico City.

A.27:  Huh.

B.28:  The most polluted city in the world [laughter].  

A.29:  Huh.  #You learn# --

B.30:  #(( )).#

A.31:  -- something every day.

B.32:  Yeah.  I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you
know, better running automobiles.

A.33:  [hum] Uh-huh.  Yeah, I've seen that.  

B.34:  Uh, some things they do, w-, w-, one of them is they're using corn in fuel.

A.35:  Huh.

B.36:  You ever heard of that?

A.37:  Huh-uh.

B.38:  Yeah.  Methanol?

A.39:  Huh.  No [squeak].

B.40:  Yeah.  Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn
[laughter].

A.41:  Oh, yeah #[laughter].#

B.42:  #[laughter].#

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  [swallowing] Uh, that's one thing that they do.  At that, it's pretty easy
to do.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And the, uh, unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause,
you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and #things like that.#

A.47:  #Yeah, that's true.#

B.48:  It doesn't make sense.  Uh, [sigh] but it's, you know, one of the most, uh,
productive crop in the #world# --

A.49:  #Right.#

B.50:  -- is corn.

A.51:  Huh.  And, of course, I doubt if there's any, you can buy regular anymore.
You buy unleaded.  Right?

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Yeah.  Huh.

B.54:  Drive cars with catalytic converters,

A.55:  [throat_clearing].

B.56:  and all that.  It's interesting.  They're, they're looking at, there's some
work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered
[child_talking] [talking].

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  And, uh, 

A.59:  [static].

B.60:  they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, but it
has a, a engine in the back --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- that charges it.  So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power
and it turns off.

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is
when you're at a stop light, you're not using any {mispronounced} any energy
[/child_talking] [/talking].

A.65:  Huh [static].  #That is good.#

B.66:  #Unlike# a car where it's running.

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  A electric car it's on demand.  I mean it's either on or off.

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  Basically.

A.71:  Huh.

B.72:  You don't have to shift #[laughter].#

A.73:  #[laughter].#

B.74:  So you, cars become very simple #all# --

A.75:  #Oh.#

B.76:  -- of a sudden too.

A.77:  [laughter].

B.78:  Very interesting.

A.79:  That would be [laughter] nice.  I think I saw that on T V one time.  They,
maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  Or something similar to that.

B.82:  There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars.  

A.83:  Huh.

B.84:  And Ford and #General Motors and all those compete.#

A.85:  #But what, w-, w-,# I think that was a, a, a setback.  That they, I don't
know, they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour.  I think like twen-,
was that something --

B.86:  Right.  Yeah {very faint}.

A.87:  -- maybe it was.  I don't know.

B.88:  G M, uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, well they
actually have an electric minivan.

A.89:  Huh?

B.90:  Yeah.  Their, their Caravan.

A.91:  Huh.

B.92:  But it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars [laughter] #right now.#

A.93:  #[laughter]# Yeah, and they're, they're very expensive too.  #(( )).#

B.94:  #[child_talking] To operate, yeah.#  But, you know, people are buying them.
You know whose buying them?  The power company.

A.95:  [laughter].

B.96:  #Free, you know, free for them.#

A.97:  #Well, yeah.#  Yeah.

B.98:  ((Kind of)) interesting #so see.#  

A.99:  #Well, it# doesn't make sense.  Because if they want people to convert, you
know.

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  They should make it worthwhile.

B.102:  Yeah [child].  It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour.  #So
it's# --

A.103:  #Yeah.#

B.104:  -- a good, #good# --

A.105:  #Yeah.#

B.106:  -- vehicle.

A.107:  Um.  Well I'll tell you.

B.108:  [child_talking].  

A.109:  Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here.  Like today I think it was pretty
bad.  I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what but --

B.110:  Uh-huh [talking].

A.111:  -- some days it's r-, very nice here downtown and other days it's just
really bad, so, I don't know.  So what, what kinds of things did you
experience in L A when you were there?  Or can you remember?  Were you there
at a?

B.112:  Oh, I wasn't there too long ago.  Uh.

A.113:  Cause I haven't been there probably ...

B.114:  Well, you know, yo-, going over the hills, you know, coming into the
valley?  [/child_talking].

A.115:  Yeah.

B.116:  You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze.  

A.117:  Well, we were there when they had a [/noise],
