============================================================

A.1:  [Breathing] Have you any #wisdom# -- 

B.2:  #Oh,# 

A.3:  -- to offer someone picking a college?

@B.4:  Well, I think [noise], I think the biggest thing that's important, is t-,
is to learn enough about the student to match the student well to the, to the
school.  And one thing I learned, I went undergraduate to Harvard and then
came out to Berkeley and it's pretty clear that there are some people who
thrive at Berkeley, uh, and there are some people who, who just die here
because of the, the amount of support that's given and the amount of, uh,
bureaucracy you have to deal with and other things like that.

A.5:  Alright.  Are, are you saying that, that there's more bureaucracy, et
cetera at, out in California?  #At that particular school?#

B.6:  #Uh, in a large public# school, I think in general.

A.7:  Huh.

B.8:  And, uh, this is a school with some thirty thousand students and it is set
up in such a fashion that students register for classes months in advance and
if they don't get them, they may not get a chance to take them that year.  Uh,
average graduation has crept up closer and closer to five years.  Largely
because of the number of students who can't get all of the courses to fulfill
their major on time.  Uh, #on the other hand, this is,#

A.9:  #That seems so wasteful# [laughter].

B.10:  It is.  An-, and it's happening in, in a lot of public schools, uh, because
of, of budget cuts.  But, on the other hand, what it does provide is for the,
uh, for students who, who need a chance to be forced to fend for themselves.
Uh, who have perhaps been too isolated.  This is a, a case where they're,
they're forced to do that.  And, and my wife went here as an undergraduate.
She had been sort of protected right through high school and, and had to learn
to, to make it on her own and she graduated from the place in four years by
learning to be smart and picking courses that, uh, at the right times and
right priorities.  And I can see that as advantageous but there are a lot of
people for whom this is just a waste of time.

A.11:  Um.  tha-, it's interesting.  You're approaching it from the a-, sort of
administrating your education just, you know, trying to get the class and be
there.  I was thinking in terms of, um, how would you advise a kid, uh, on
how to pick his future career.  I, I have a son whose a freshman in high
school --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and he hasn't got a clue [laughter], you know, what he wants to do.  You
know, he's good in math and science #and# --

B.14:  #Uh-huh.#

A.15:  -- h-, you know, uh, his stepdad is an engineer, his father's an
accountant, you know.  #He, he'll# --

B.16:  #Uh-huh.#

A.17:  -- probably lean toward some kind of math or science kind of thing but
he's not sure what.  I, myself, graduated with an undergraduate and a Master's
in art.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And I did it because it's just something I love to do.  And I felt that I'm
not, I'm not a Picasso, so I'll guess I'll teach #and I# --

B.20:  #Uh-huh [noise].#

A.21:  -- kind of backed myself into a career that I never ended up really using.
I mean, now that I'm raising my kids, I'm substitute teaching because the
hours are so good, et cetera --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- but I had never given that much thought to whether I actually liked to
teach, you know.  It just seemed that, well that's a practical thing you can
do with art so you might as well do it.

B.24:  Right [noise].

A.25:  And I guess my advice to, uh, kids approaching college would, first of all,
do something practical because the art for me, uh, didn't work out very
practically.  I got out of school when the Vietnam draft evasion was going on,

B.26:  [Noise].

A.27:  and everybody wanted to be a teacher.  There were no jobs and I ended up
taking a secretarial school summer class for graduate, college graduates,
which #it struck me as so# --

B.28:  #Jus-, just to be# able to find a job that you would qualify for
[laughter].

A.29:  -- so sad.  You know, #there's# --

B.30:  #Yeah.#

A.31:  -- a whole bunch of college graduates who are learning how to type just to
be able to, to make some money.

B.32:  Well --

A.33:  And, uh,

B.34:  -- I, I think one of the reasons that I don't see that as, as much of a
problem, see I would encourage people to go into college not knowing what they
want to do because so many of the high schools have done such a bad job at
introducing different areas --

A.35:  Um.

B.36:  -- that it may be that what you want to do and it may be a very practical
thing to go into, doesn't seem attractive because what you have learned of it
so far is, is not interesting.  A lot of people are turned off from math
because of high school math.  And going to a school that offers a lot of
choice and taking your first year or two to explore what the choices are,
still gives you plenty of time #and# --

A.37:  #To pick.# So you, you're suggesting some liberal arts program where you
take a smattering {mispronounced} of everything.

B.38:  -- and then eventually focus on a single major.  I certainly wouldn't say
to go to a liberal arts school that doesn't have a strong science program.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Uh, and I'd even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering
program but I tend to look, I don't like what I see from the students who are
graduating here with engineering degrees where seventy-five or eighty percent
of their time is spent in a prearranged technical curriculum.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And they are moving here towards a program where they have a Bachelor of
Arts and a Master of Science combined where you get a general education with
guaranteed admission into an engineering degree for a Masters' degree.

A.43:  Oh, that {very faint} [/breathing],

B.44:  And that seems like a good compromise.  It's,
