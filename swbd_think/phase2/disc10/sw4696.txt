===========================================================================

A.1:  Well Brad, what do you hear in San Jose about Ross Perot?  Do you hear as
much do you think as we do here in Dallas?

B.2:  Um, probably not anywhere near as much.  There have been a couple of
articles, uh, which I basically glanced at.  Uh, but that's about it.  I just
find it interesting that somebody with that much money,

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  uh, would be interested in the presidency in the first place.  I guess
it's, it's as much, you know, just the sense of power and the sense of being
able to accomplish things, uh, as much as anything else.  I don't know.  It
seems to me that if I had that kind of money, I would feel like I were more
influential as a private citizen than as the president.

A.5:  Well that could be.  Uh, R-, Ross Perot is not a politician.  I mean,
[laughter] this is kind of new to him.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  I, I don't know.  Are you familiar with things that he's done in the past
that have gotten quite a bit of attention?  [inhaling] Like, uh, rescuing the
E D S employees that were being held in jail in Tehran?

B.8:  Huh.  No, no.  I, I hadn't #really paid,#

A.9:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.10:  that much attention.

A.11:  Yeah [laughter].  I mean this, this was a few years ago.  Probably ten or
so.

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#

A.13:  #Ten# or twelve.  Uh, he hired a some retired army guys to go in after him.
And supposedly, even, I think, went in by him, with, went in to see them
disguised, you know, as somebody else.

B.14:  Wow.

A.15:  But, uh, he, at least, ended up over there in one of the neighboring
companies, prob-, countries, probably Afghanistan or something, to meet them
when they came out of, uh, out of Iran.  And I think he was, uh, maybe a
little, getting a little bit involved in politics or something during the
Vietnam war.  He, uh, tried to send supplies over to the prisoners.

B.16:  Uh-huh [sniffing].

A.17:  Uh, {very faint} I don't know i-, of course we hear a lot of him because he
lives here, in the Dallas area [laughter].

B.18:  What kind of, I mean, this, this obviously says something for his, uh, you
know, something for one aspect of his character.  What kind of person is he in
terms of,

A.19:  Uh, he was an outstanding salesman at I B M, I've read [laughter] until he
quit there and started his own company.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Which he later sold out to General Motors and, and since then, he's started
a new company but I think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was
at some time.  Uh, my impression is that he's a pretty honest person.

B.22:  Be kind of a change.

A.23:  I've heard him on the radio and whatnot.  I mean he just seems very
forthright.  H-, h-, he doesn't have to play games #[laughter].#

B.24:  #Yeah, (( )) [laughter].#  

A.25:  #I mean,# 

B.26:  #He's, he's already won.#

A.27:  That's right, that's right.  I, I'm just curious to see what's going to
happen #to the# --

B.28:  #Uh-huh.#

A.29:  -- political scene, uh, if he gets on the ballot in all the states and
whatnot.  Do, do you think he can be a spoiler for Bush?

B.30:  [Inhaling] Uh, {pause} [lipsmack] I honestly don't think so.  Uh, not
unless he really puts a lot of effort into it and I don't think he wants to.
I think it's, uh, I think being a seriously con-, being seriously considered
as a presidential candidate is something that, uh, it, it just takes a really
hugh investment in personal effort, not just, you know, I mean, I'm sure it
takes a lot of money as well.

A.31:  Oh, yeah [laughter].

B.32:  But, uh, just in terms of the number of personal appearances that you've
got to make and all the, the, the hoops that you've got to jump through in
order to get the media sound bites and get people paying attention to you, I
mean, #an occasional newspaper# --

A.33:  #All the backslapping.#

B.34:  -- article wi-, will show up for, for any variety of things but being
considered seriously, I think, is, you know, may take more than he's willing
to put into it.

A.35:  Yeah.  Uh, e-, yeah, could be, could be.  I, I also suspect that one aspect
of his personality would be that he would be re-, really tenacious.

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  O-, or maybe stubborn even #[laughter] I don't know,#

B.38:  #[Laughter].#

A.39:  so I don't know, you know, he might [throat_clearing] decide to go whole
hog and really go out and, and turn into a politician and do all the back
slapping and, and, uh, handshaking and all that.  Kiss a few babies I suppose.

B.40:  Yeah.  Well I don't suppose he'd have to do a whole lot of fund raising or,
uh, [inhaling] worry a whole lot about [sigh] where the funding was coming
from.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  So he'd have that advantage.

A.43:  Yeah.  Yeah (( )) uh, certainly different.  I mean Bush is wealthy --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- but nothing like that [laughter].

B.46:  Yeah [sniffing].

A.47:  I, I mean I don't know what they put Perot's wealth at.  I think it's
probably a few billion or something.

B.48:  Yeah. I've, I've, I've heard it in the billions.  I didn't hear specifics.
I figured once it, you know, once it reaches that point it doesn't really
matter how many numbers are in front of the B, you know.  It, #[laughter]# --

A.49:  #Yeah [laughter].#

B.50:  -- it's passed, it's passed any kind of reasonable imagining in the first
place, #so.#

A.51:  #Yeah.# Well I, [sigh] in a way I, I'm interested in his candidacy.  I'd
like to, I'd like to kind of,
