============================================================================

B.1:  #((Oh so)),#

A.2:  #Okay.# I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so
#[laughter].#

B.3:  #Well, it, let's put# it this way.  We've got the New England Patriots up
here so.

A.4:  Oh yeah.  Right.  Well,

B.5:  They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.  

A.6:  Really?  

B.7:  Yeah.

A.8:  Why?

B.9:  Um, well, uh, partly due to ownership.  You know, uh, Victor Kiam owned
the, uh, the Patriots --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- uh, for a period of a number of years and he always had this, uh, this
wonderful quality of c-, being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he
went to say something [talking] and, uh, they've had some financial problems
with the team and so forth.  And it recently was sold [talking] to, uh, some
other people so, hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, uh,
keep, uh, the Patriots in the New England area anyways [/talking].

A.12:  Yeah.  Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway --

B.13:  Oh, #yeah.#

A.14:  -- #to# see what happens now you,

B.15:  I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before.

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  Now you, you're, you're from Texas.

A.18:  Right.

B.19:  So you've got two football teams down there.

A.20:  Well, it depends on where you're from in Texas.  I live right by Dallas --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- so we have one football team --

B.23:  #Oh, I see.#

A.24:  -- #as far as we're# concerned [laughter].  #That's how it is.#

B.25:  #There's that type of segregation, huh?#

A.26:  It's divided, #yeah.#

B.27:  #Wow!#

A.28:  It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here and --

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  -- and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently but --

B.31:  [Throat_clearing] #Do you,# 

A.32:  -- #I have# a boyfriend that lives in Fresno and he is for the L, the, uh,
Raiders.

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  L A Raiders, so.

B.35:  Do you follow professional sports at all?

A.36:  Well, I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that
didn't do very well #[laughter],#

B.37:  #[Laughter].#

A.38:  but [laughter] I've been trying more this year.  I think I know a little
more than I use to.

B.39:  #Yeah.#

A.40:  #I never# knew very much at all so I'm trying [laughter].

B.41:  Well, it's a good past time, #you know.#  

A.42:  #[Swallowing] Yeah.#

B.43:  Particularly football.  They say, uh, i-, football attracts more men
because of the, you know, y-, the, you see the, the physical aggression on the
field and supposedly, psychologists say that, uh, that, uh, men take out their
frustrations by watching football and, you know, they get together with a
bunch of guys and they, uh, uh, and they have a good time and everything and
that's suppose to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh,
the male instincts, I guess, or something about #the, uh,#

A.44:  #So# I shouldn't even try to do it, huh [laughter]?

B.45:  Well, no.  It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, uh, of a contest.

A.46:  #Yes.#

B.47:  #I# think that, uh, I personally like hockey better because it has
contact, it's a contact sport.  It has the speed.

A.48:  Right.

B.49:  And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey.
Not everybody can play hockey.

A.50:  Yeah.

B.51:  So we, and that's, we're a big hockey area up here, I bet up here in New
England as well --

A.52:  ((Really)).

B.53:  -- as, you know, in, in the Minnesota area but,

A.54:  I don't even think we have that in Texas.

B.55:  What, hockey?

A.56:  We might.  Do we?

B.57:  #[Laughter].#

A.58:  #[Talking] I mean,# no [laughter], you probably know, I don't know.

B.59:  No, there's no hockey, #there's no [throat_clearing].#

A.60:  #Nobody talks about it# so I don't think we do.

B.61:  There's no professional hockey teams in, #in Texas (( ))
[throat_clearing].#

A.62:  #No, uh-huh.# And we have a soccer team that comes and goes.  We don't even
have that very much, so.

B.63:  Yeah.  I think though that professional football --

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  -- in particular, is becoming so diluted now.  Like they have this World
Football League.  You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas --

A.66:  Yeah.

B.67:  -- and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those
teams [throat_clearing].  There are those teams that play in professional,
National Football League [breathing] but, uh, now they have what's called the
World Football League and they have all these teams from, there's a team in
London and there's a team #[throat_clearing]# --

A.68:  #Oh.#

B.69:  -- there, there's, uh, teams, other European teams and there's teams in the
United States an-, and they're playing now during the summer months and it's
really [door] you know, overkill [swallowing].

A.70:  #Oh yeah.#

B.71:  #And# there's only so much football you can watch.

A.72:  Yeah.  Well, I like to do, I don't like to watch.

B.73:  Yeah, #that's good.# 

A.74:  #I don't like# to watch anything.  So it kind of annoys me when people just
lay in front of a T V and watch #all this stuff.  I think it's an,#

B.75:  #[Noise] [laughter].#

A.76:  excuse to do nothing and I, I can see what you're saying about the male
bonding #and the# --

B.77:  #Yeah.#

A.78:  -- guys get together and that's kind of cool.  That's fun, you know.

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  But it can get really #overdone.#

B.81:  #Now,# have you ever been to a professional football game?

A.82:  Yeah, I have.

B.83:  #Have you?#

A.84:  #Yeah, yeah,# I have.

B.85:  Did you do the whole big, th-, the whole thing, the tailgate party and #the
whole,#

A.86:  #Uh, [sigh] no# actually, #no.#

B.87:  #Well# see, now see that's what you got to do, see.  #Now we talked our,#

A.88:  #I've done that for# college football.

B.89:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.90:  #Yeah.#

B.91:  You, the, well the same thing. 

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  We, we talked our wives, there's about six or eight guys that we use to go
out for these games.  And, uh, we talked our wives into going with us one time
and they had a real good time and it was, basically, for the social
atmosphere.

A.94:  Right.  And that's #the thing, you know.#

B.95:  #You go, you know# three or four hours before the game.  You go set up.  We
set a table up, we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks --

A.96:  Yeah.

B.97:  -- and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then #go
home and eat, drink some more.#

A.98:  #[Laughter].#

B.99:  But, but that whole, it, it's not so much, sure the contest itself and the
game itself, but it's the whole atmosphere of playing, uh, of going to a game.

A.100:  Yeah.

B.101:  I-, that you miss sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a
six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips, #you know# --

A.102:  #That's right.#

B.103:  -- you, you miss that.  

A.104:  Yeah, that's right.

B.105:  And, and any professional sport I think,

A.106:  [Noise].

B.107:  you miss that.

A.108:  Uh-huh.

B.109:  The atmosphere of being there, #you know.#

A.110:  #Yeah.#  Well, in high school I went to every football game and,

B.111:  [Laughter].

A.112:  well, I twirled, you know.  

B.113:  #Yep.#

A.114:  #And I,# you know, I didn't, I still don't know that much about football,
obviously.  But I still had a good time.  You know,

B.115:  Well foot-,
