============================================================================

B.1:  [Throat_clearing].

@A.2:  [Swallowing] [talking] You want to go first [laughter].

B.3:  Well, uh, no I don-, I don't get as much exercise as I, as I should as, or
as I would like to, uh, uh, these days.  I, seems to be to easy to get busy
with other things.  Uh, I have, in the past, uh, jogged and, and run, and
every, every January and every September, I start out again and then it tapers
off [laughter].

A.4:  Really?

B.5:  Uh, what about you?  

A.6:  Well, yeah, I do a lot of exercise.  Right now, I'm into jazzercise, which
I absolutely love.  Uh, I started about two years ago because I gained some
weight over the past few years and I wanted to get it back off --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- and I was going through a divorce and I just found that running really
made me feel good.

B.9:  #Yeah.#

A.10:  #Got out a# lot of aggression.  I went to the gym every day and I ran on
the treadmill and rode the bike and, uh, I felt really good.  I needed to do
it and it was really helpful at the time.  Now when I do those things, they're
boring.  I would rather be outside then [noise] in the gym doing this in one
place.

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  And so I just recently discovered jazzercise, about two months ago.  And
I'm getting to be a good dancer from it and I'm just feeling really good.  I
love the class, it's real challenging, so I'm really into that,

B.13:  [Snorting].

A.14:  I really like that a lot.

B.15:  Well now that, is that, uh, that's related to the, the aerobic, uh, #((
)),#

A.16:  #It is, it's# aerobics but it's with dance steps.

B.17:  Okay.

A.18:  It's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight.  And it's just, uh,
it's a lot of fun.  I feel like I'm not just exercising.

B.19:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.20:  #Because I'm# dancing and I'm, I'm getting much better.  My stamina is
getting great for the dance floor [laughter], #so# --

B.21:  #Yeah.#

A.22:  -- I mean it's just, there's a lot of positive things with it, so.

B.23:  Well, uh, okay.  Now that's inside again, right?

A.24:  It is inside and #I've# --

B.25:  #But,# 

A.26:  -- been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been
having and I just enjoy that much more too #than inside.#

B.27:  #Do, do you# like to do it wi-, with other people.  I mean like the, the
#jazzercise would be?#

A.28:  #I have a# thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's
nice.  We get --

B.29:  Yeah.

A.30:  -- to spend some time together rather than I go to the gym while she does
her homework.

B.31:  Yeah.

A.32:  So I've enjoyed that part of it.  Yeah.  And at the gym, even in the class,
uh, I, w-, e-, it's not really a group where you chat a lot.  Everybody's on
their way to someplace --

B.33:  Right.

A.34:  -- and so, you know, #I do# --

B.35:  #But,# 

A.36:  -- have one friend who goes occasionally but, basically, I do it by myself
in a group of maybe forty #[laughter], so.#

B.37:  #Yeah, right.# Right.  But still there are, there are other people there
doing the, #doing the same thing.#

A.38:  #There are, there are.#  It's more motivating #that way, I think. Yeah.#

B.39:  #In terms of motivation and incentive, yeah.#

A.40:  You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V but i-,
you probably wouldn't.

B.41:  Yeah.

A.42:  #So.#

B.43:  #Yeah,# uh, that makes a difference doesn't it?

A.44:  Yeah.  

B.45:  I, I've, one thing, when, when I have [swallowing] run and jogged, uh, I've
always enjoyed doing it by myself and, and, kno-, not with the sense that it
was, uh, uh, chore or something that I was having to do, I, I've really
enjoyed just the activity and, uh, [sigh] I write software, uh, as far as the
job and so getting out and being active, uh, is, uh, uh, helps out. #((The,
th-, it's))#

A.46:  #Yeah,#  #yeah, I can see it'll be a good break.#

B.47:  #((The ch-, the chan-, the))# change of pace and #just# --

A.48:  #Right.#

B.49:  -- getting out and around and I find that I can often, you know, often, uh,
when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to 
#work# --

A.50:  #Uh-huh# {faint}.

B.51:  -- and, uh, uh, also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things
while #I'm working# --

A.52:  #Yeah# {faint}.

B.53:  -- and I, I go back and I've got new ideas, but #((still)).#

A.54:  #Yeah. I think# you do.  You feel very good after you exercise.  #I 
think# --

B.55:  #Yeah.#

A.56:  -- it's worth making the time for yourself.  You owe it to yourself
#[noise]# --

B.57:  #Yeah.#

A.58:  -- and I think you do accomplish [noise] more after that.  

B.59:  Yeah.

A.60:  And I think that it's just is good for your self-esteem, for everything
because when you look better, you feel better and it's just, uh, I think it's
well worth it.  I just demand that time for myself.  Now I've learned to do
that --

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  -- and, you know, and it's, I think it just benefits you all around.  So.

B.63:  Yeah, I think that's, uh, I think that's a good term, d-, demanding the
time for yourself.  That #you've just got to# --

A.64:  #You have to.  Because# --

B.65:  -- #you've ((just got to prior-,))# 

A.66:  -- #there's always more things# to do.

B.67:  #Right.#    

A.68:  #There is# always things that you can make priority to it but I just, I
don't demand a lot for myself and so --

B.69:  Yeah.

A.70:  -- you know, I just feel entitled to it and I take it #[laughter], so.#

B.71:  #Well good, well good.# Well, uh, uh, have you, have you done any jogging?
I tell you, you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in, in the, #uh,
club.#

A.72:  #[Sigh] No, I've# done some walking with friends in the past.

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  But I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do --

B.75:  Yeah.

A.76:  -- exercise and that's not really beneficial, so, uh --

B.77:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.78:  -- I don't have time like that and I spend enough time chatting around
#[laughter] everywhere, you know [/talking].#

B.79:  #[Laughter].#
