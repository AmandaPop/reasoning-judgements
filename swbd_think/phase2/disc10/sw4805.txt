=============================================================================

A.1:  [Child_talking] Kay.  Uh, I, I'm not to familiar with the topic because,
uh, I haven't been in that situation I guess [laughter].  But I watch a lot of
the documentaries on the T V and that kind of thing.  It always kind of
interests me #and,# 

B.2:  #I had# to run close the door so I didn't hear the whole thing.

A.3:  Oh, okay.  About, uh, penalty and trials and that kind of thing.  If it
should be left up to the judge or trial by jury or to the people, #that kind
of thing.#

@B.4:  #[Throat_clearing] Well,# I think it's, uh, the way it is is probably, uh,
pretty good,

A.5:  [Child_talking].

B.6:  as far as the, uh, you know some of them are, I believe you, uh, the
defendant has a chance to request trial by jury if they want.

A.7:  [Child_talking] Yeah.

B.8:  And they just, uh, then there are some cases that go to the judge.

A.9:  Uh, and I think the topic was like, uh, should it be that way or should it
be, uh, [child_talking] up to the people or, uh, #I think [static]# --

B.10:  #Well# I, uh, again I think it's, uh, #I# --

A.11:  -- #that,#

B.12:  -- think the defendant should have a choice there.  If he want's a trial by
jury and then, uh, the option of letting, you know, rely on the judge to try
it.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  Some cases it, you know, probably doesn't require a full jury.

A.15:  I would assume it would take more of the taxpayers' money for it to go
[laughter] through trial #by jury.#

B.16:  #You're exactly# right.

A.17:  But sometimes it seems like it comes out, the outcome comes out the best.
Som-, in, in most cases it comes out the best when it's trial by jury.  But I,
I could see where it could take up a lot of, uh, the community's money that
way rather than just leaving it up to the judge.

B.18:  You think it, uh, it always comes out the best with the jury?

A.19:  I'd say for the most part.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Not, you know, it, it's, it's hard.  It really is.  #But I,# 

B.22:  #What# about the fact that, uh, the jury may be six people in some cases,
but, uh, maybe they're not,

A.23:  [Talking].

B.24:  you know, one reason or another, just maybe get a bad bunch or whatever
[laughter] and they, uh,

A.25:  Yeah, you can.  You can.  But it seems like when, when it's trial by jury,
it's a little more detailed, it's a little more slower.  And, uh, I don't
know, you, it's just, it, it requires a little bit more thinking.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Uh, requires a little more research.  That kind of thing.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  That's why I say, it probably, m-, in most cases, I would think it would,
the outcome would be better, in most cases, not always.  But, #uh,# 

B.30:  #I tell# you what the (( )) [laughter] along the lines, a little more
exciting topic is what the, the, uh, criminal, uh, punishment panel is, uh,
reviewing in Austin right now.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  You know, which is, uh, reducing a rape case without a firearm, without a
weapon to, uh, just practically a misdemeanor.

A.33:  Oh, really [child_talking].

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  Huh.

B.36:  Actually, they call it a fifth, fourth or fifth degree felony which is
[laughter] can't ev-, you know, be no jail time.

A.37:  Right, right.

B.38:  And, uh, [throat_clearing] and, of course, the hottest topic of the day
[laughter] along jurisprudence lines is the, uh, the early release of
prisoners.  At least, down here in Houston, it is.

A.39:  Yeah.  I heard about that, yeah.  Yeah, that's, that's real scary, you
know.  I, I, I just think things are, there's a lot of changes right now that
are going on and it's getting to be where it's really, it's just real scary.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Uh, I don't know.  But then again, I guess it takes up a lot of your
taxpayers' money and time and, uh, [talking] I don't know, it's just, it's
{pause}, I don't know [laughter].

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  That's a hard one, you know [talking].  Yeah.

B.44:  Well, I, uh, [throat_clearing] they sure need to do something.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  (( )) you know, early release, there's a, uh, as far as letting them out.
#when you have five# --

A.47:  #Do you feel that that's work-,#

B.48:  -- percent of your capacity is still available, I think they're, uh,
they're just, they're just con-, to concerned with prisoners rights and not
enough concern #with the victim's# --

A.49:  #Yeah.#

B.50:  -- rights, you know.                     

A.51:  Right.  #I, they had# --

B.52:  #I mean,#

A.53:  -- a, a documentary tha-, on that on, uh, do you ever watch FORTY-EIGHT
HOURS?  

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  They had something very similar to that.  And, uh, and that's real scary
too, you know.  I mean to really think about.  It really is [/child_talking].

B.56:  Well there's a, there's a bill been passed last year that, uh, would allow,
I don't know exactly where these beds are, but there's some, I guess they tap
in like hospital beds and all and what the, uh, intent is to lump them in
with the actual prison beds they have and, and that way, thereby increasing
the, uh, capacity immediately.
