REMARKS:        There is a child talking and yelling on A's side and it
is hard to hear her.  A also talks to child a couple of times.

=========================================================================

A.1:  So [child].

B.2:  Well, you can start [laughter].

@A.3:  Uh, I can start [noise].  The notion of a, of [noise] universal service
sometimes sounds real good.  But, I, I sometimes wonder whether it's, if
people aren't willing to do it, do anything like that on their own and I guess
it would have to be really and truly universal and then I think you start
running into all sorts of people's religious objections and in-, you know, and
how do you make allowances for everybody's culture if you try to force fit
everybody into things and, ((I guess)) e-, the logistics of it just seem
horrendous (( )).

B.4:  Yeah, I, I frankly can't go along with the idea only because it's the same
kind of thing that you see,

A.5:  [Noise].

B.6:  in countries like Cuba and, [laughter] uh, other places where you're,
supposedly, for the good of society, you're to volunteer and help out,

A.7:  [Noise].

B.8:  and, and do something very nicely for everyone and the problem comes into
play in that if the people aren't interested in what they're volunteering for
and they're not getting paid, there's no incentive whatsoever and really, you,
in any group that depends on volunteers, say, uh, the American Red Cross and
something, uh, those kind of groups you can actually, you could actually
become a hindrance to the group if you aren't really interested #and you're
just there# --

A.9:  #In what you're doing.#

B.10:  -- because you have to.

A.11:  Yeah, yeah.  It, it, [sigh] I don't know, on the other hand, there are
other countries like Switzerland and Israel and France that have universal
service --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- Uh, you know, which are democracies.  Uh, I don't know about France, I
know that Switzerland and Israel though are somewhat more hom-, homogeneous.

B.14:  Oh yeah, certainly.  I mean, there's, e-, especially in Israel, there's a
particular, the cause for the good of the nation, especially when it's on the
defensive and the region --

A.15:  #Yeah.#

B.16:  -- #really# inspires to people to help out for the good of the country.

A.17:  [Noise].  

B.18:  #But we have,# 

A.19:  #Yeah,# but they still have a universal, well (( )) to universal draft.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Uh, and they still run into, to problems.  There are some people [noise]
who feel that women should not have to take orders from men because it leads
to morality problems and I just think that you would run into people who felt
that way here.

B.22:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.23:  Not only, uh, peoples of a very strict Jewish cast but also, I think that a
lot of the fundamentalists would have problems with --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- their daughters being under the, you know, having to take orders from a
man [noise] and who know what and ta da, da, da.  Uh, you know, I just so, I,
I, you get, get really torn.  On the other hand, one of my, one of my favorite
science fiction books is a book by, uh, Robert Heinlien, yes {stops and talks
to child} {resumes talking to B} [noise] uh, called STARSHIP TROOPER or
something and he talks about you had to serve the country in order to have the
right to vote.

B.26:  Sure.

A.27:  In other words, you had to first show that it meant something to you in
order to, to have the right to say what ought to happen [noise].  Uh, and so
that, you know, I'm sort of torn.  That idea makes a whole lot of sense too.
People who are just along for the ride, why should they say how my money
should be spent and why should they say what I ought to do [sniffing].

B.28:  Well there should be some tangible benefit, uh, i-, if you really want to
get into something where you want to have a full participation and have it
work well is to have something where they select the programs or whatever that
they #wish# --

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  -- to participate in and give them some tangible benefit for doing so to
inspire, uh, more involvement on their part.

A.31:  Right.  

B.32:  In the, and that's the way I think you really over, take over this problem
or get rid of the problem of them, you know, conscientious objection or what
have you, if you give them the option of selecting what #it is# --

A.33:  #Right.#

B.34:  -- that they want to do.  #I,# 

A.35:  #Well, and# and that's, that would be kind of an interesting way of doing
it, I think, if you're going to do something like that because it, instead of
voting for a representative who votes for laws or whatever, you vote by what
you're willing to participate in [noise].

B.36:  Yeah.  I, I #think it has a lot of potential but I# --

A.37:  #Yes, but I can't get one right now {talking to child} [noise].#

B.38:  -- don't think that we're going to ever see something like that get through
in this country #because of the# --

A.39:  #No, probably not.#

B.40:  -- [Laughter] mismatch of political nonsense that goes on in Washington
[laughter].

A.41:  Yeah.  Well, and, and the other thing is [/child],
