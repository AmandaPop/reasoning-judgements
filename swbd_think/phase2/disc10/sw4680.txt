===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I think Don, that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of
the country than it is in yours.  Do you suppose that's true?

@B.2:  Well, you're probably right.  

A.3:  (( )) {very faint}.

B.4:  Up here in Rochester we, uh, we don't have, uh, much controversy about
immigration [breathing].  You know, being on the Canadian border, there's not
a whole lot of people [laughter], you know, dying to come across and live
here.

A.5:  Yeah.  Maybe they have a problem [laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter] Sometimes I think they ought to [laughter].

A.7:  Yeah.  Well, of course, we're quite a ways from the Mexican border here.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  But, uh, oh, you hear on the news and whatnot of, uh, some of the sad
things associated with immigration like, uh, loading up a truck full of
immigrants and it runs out of gas or something and they sit out in th-, bake
in the sun because they're locked in the back of it and things #like that.#

B.10:  #Uh-huh.#  Yeah.

A.11:  So there are a lot of tragedies, I think, associated with immigration.

B.12:  Yeah, I think it's, uh, [breathing] I think it's a real shame.  But on the
other hand, you know, it kind of, [breathing] even with all the tragedies, if
you step back and look at it, the fact that people want to come here must be
that there's something better here than, or at least they think there's
something better here than there is, uh, wherever they're from.

A.13:  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  I, I mean tha-, th-, what I see is
Mexico, of course.  #Rather# --

B.14:  #Yeah.#

A.15:  -- South American countries.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Uh, unfortunately, I think that, that the immigrants tend to really stretch
the social services --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- that can be provided to the folks, #uh,# 

B.20:  #Yeah.# Yeah, that's true, but I think that's probably always been true
throughout, uh, history of the United States.  Uh, I think anytime you have,
uh, you know, immigrants coming in who perhaps, you know, don't have the
ability to communicate with a large percentage of the population that's
already here, I think they're bound to, to push the social services a little
bit.  Do you think it's worse today than it was maybe fifty years ago?

A.21:  Uh, {pause} yeah, I think maybe it is.  I, and I think that's not
necessarily the fault of immigration but just the way the world is going to
you know what in a hand basket #anyway [laughter].#

B.22:  #Uh-huh, yeah.#

A.23:  I think that there's so many other problems, especially in the cities.

B.24:  Uh-huh, #yeah.#

A.25:  #Uh,# crime for example.  And, i-, uh, uh --

B.26:  Yeah {very faint}.

A.27:  -- Uh, I don't know, I think it's all tied up together.  #I know# --

B.28:  #Yeah. You're probably r-,#

A.29:  -- that the immigrant, immigr-, of course, now Dallas has a lot of, uh,
Asian immigrants.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  In fact a large community of them.

B.32:  Okay.

A.33:  And, uh, they have their special problems.  Uh, [sigh] of for example,
crime I mentioned.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Crime against immigrants is, is a severe problem because the people that
came from the southeast Asian countries don't want to call the police.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  You know, they, they have fear of the police #and whatnot.#

B.38:  #That's right.# That's right.  It's really interesting to me because as, as
yo-, as, as you pointed out at the beginning, here in Rochester, uh, now we
don't have it, immigration pro-, we don't even have a lot of immigration.  But
on the other hand, you know, it's, we do have, uh, a large influx of, uh,
people from, say, Jamaica or other parts of the Caribbean.  Tha-, that's rea-,
you know, and Puerto Rico, we have a, a large population from there.  People
who have come over, you know, maybe in the last [breathing] you know, ten or
twenty years --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- have moved here.  No why somebody from Jamaica want to, would want to
move to cold Rochester #[laughter] I'm a little,#

A.41:  #[Laughter].#

B.42:  uh, I'm a little hard pressed [laughter] to understand but they do it,
so, so, you know, I don't blame them.  To each their own.  But, you know, if
you look at. at a place like Rochester now.  Now we have a large [swallowing]
population of like second and third generation Americans.  Of people who ca-,
you know, whose parents or grandparents came to, uh, the United States.  You
know, people from Italy.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Uh, people from Poland, people from the Ukraine.  Uh, an-, and I always,
you know, I always wonder whether, you know, was the situation any different
back then.  I mean, how did the people who had been in the United States for,
for a while feel about this large [breathing] amount of immigration.  Uh, it's
fairly well known that at one of the major companies in Rochester who, I won't
say their name, but I'm sure you've heard of them, uh, back in the thirties
didn't want to hire the Italian immigrants #because# --

A.45:  #Huh.#

B.46:  -- it, it was, it was a discriminatory practice #and, uh# --

A.47:  #Yeah.#

B.48:  -- you know, it just makes me wonder, you know.  An-, you know, I look at
what, what made this country great and a lot of cases, it was the immigrants
who came over and worked and I, and sometimes I wonder, you know, whether, you
know, just how different is the situation today.

A.49:  Oh, I think, I think they want to work.  I think they're often under
educated.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  I think that's why, maybe one reason why they have so much difficult in
their own countries.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Uh, I, I have trouble with,
