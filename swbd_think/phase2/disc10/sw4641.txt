=========================================================================

B.1:  No, you start [laughter].

A.2:  [Breathing] [noise] [laughter] Okay.  What are the benefits?  Well, I, I
mean I don't even consider, like salary a real benefit.  It just, it's kind of
a like a side thing.  I'm really here for, you know, working with lots of
creative people is what I really like about my job [noise].

@B.3:  [Swallowing] Well I think that, I'm self-employed and work in radio and,
uh, [sigh] for me, really, I don't have to be terribly concerned about, uh,
benefits outside because I own my own company.  But, uh, the worst problem
that I think, uh, out here, is affecting people and I think would be the most
positive job benefit, is job security these days.

A.4:  That's true.  Yeah, you don't, don't want to have worry about it [laughter]
you know.  #If, if you're# --

B.5:  #Yeah.  It's,# 

A.6:  -- worried you don't work as well.

B.7:  Well, it, it's a real problem out here because, uh, you know, it's hard to
imagine that, you know, that ten years ago I can remember where we really, you
know, somebody would work for a local company here like Kodak or Xerox which
are based here and, uh, they'd have that job for life and you really didn't
have to worry too much about that.  But every since this Reagan Bush thing --

A.8:  I know.

B.9:  -- every single time there's, you know, th-, the first thing they do is
they fire employees whenever there's a problem with the, uh, uh, ec-, economy
and clear out the employees and we're losing more and more jobs and, uh,

A.10:  And it just gets worse then people don't, don't spend any money.

B.11:  Yeah, it, it's a real, that's probably the biggest thing that I think
people are looking for.  I, uh, put some things up in the Comp, DCom, Telecom
{mispronounced} thing regularly about, uh, job security with the, uh, A T and
T #employees# --

A.12:  #Right, yeah.#  I, I just noticed that.

B.13:  -- and the #Communication# --

A.14:  #Yeah.#

B.15:  -- Workers of America and I'm watching as that progresses more and more and
it seems to me that we're seeing a real problem with job security being the
number one focus.  It's no longer a question of salary or, or perks.  It, it's
just basic security to have that job.

A.16:  [Inhaling] Yeah, I know, I know exactly how you feel.  But, (( )) ho-, how
can we get people to change it?  I mean,

B.17:  #Well, I, in,# 

A.18:  #it, it kind,# it kind of requires, you know, a company taking a risk and
they don't want to do that [laughter].

B.19:  [Throat_clearing] Well I think, maybe, some incentives on the part of the
government to retain employees, uh, versus downsizing.  Really why we're
seeing that kind of downsizing is because of the, uh, increasing power of
shareholders in the corporations of the country.

A.20:  That's true.

B.21:  Whenever there's a, uh, problem with, uh, the economy or the stock value,
you know, the first thing the stockholders want to see is well decrease costs
which means cut employees.

A.22:  I know.  I mean our C E O is, is, you know {faint}, quite frankly stated
that, you know, we're here to make stockholders happy and that's not why I'm
working here [laughter].

B.23:  [Sniffing] Yeah, California is really starting to feel the effects, I
think, of the, uh, #downturn [laughter].#

A.24:  #Oh, definitely# [laughter].

B.25:  You know, you guys have been pretty insulated, uh, for some of the past
ones.  It, it hasn't hit as bad as it has out in the northeast here.
Rochester's, luckily, is a technology moving city.  I mean, we have a lot of
#telecommunications# --

A.26:  #Right.#

B.27:  -- and the like out here, but Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here
that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that, steel mills,
they're all gone, they're all in Mexico now [laughter] [throat_clearing].

A.28:  [Laughter] Yeah, w-, we're just kind of like losing.  And it, it just seems
to be a snowball effect.  I mean, you know, we keep losing more.

B.29:  Well, ((Cupertino)) seems to be one of their, every single software company
((over seas)) always think (( )), you know #[laughter].#

A.30:  #[Laughter].# 

B.31:  So you guys at least don't have those kinds of, you know, the only pro-,
software seems to be still a U S #strength# --

A.32:  #Right, but# [laughter],

B.33:  -- versus hardware.  But, you know, again, in the future we're going to see
the same type of thing.  Even in more white collar work where we're going to
have job security, #I think# --

A.34:  #Yes.#

B.35:  -- being the biggest focus.

A.36:  Thi-, things aren't that secure in software right now either.  It's kind of
a cutthro-, I'm also a, also a hardware manufacturer.  I'm at Apple so it's
like, [inhaling] you know, we, we notice our product just becoming a commodity
and that's really bad.

B.37:  Well, I heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics
#company.#

A.38:  #We're trying.# And if it works, tha-, that'd be great for us but what
about, you know, the rest of the industry [clicking].

B.39:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, well, the hardware, you know, H D T V, if we can
keep control of that, that looks like something that [inhaling] we could have
good strengths on and there would be a #lot of new jobs# --

A.40:  #Yeah, (( )),# 

B.41:  -- created.

A.42:  Well, w-, we go on that subject.  I, ((cause)) I looked at H D T V but I
don't like standards that are on, ((still on a)) fixed resolution which means
it will be eventually outdated also.

B.43:  Uh-huh.  Well, we, I'm a home satellite dish owner.  We have these
arguments all the time,

A.44:  [Laughter].

B.45:  about standards because of the video cipher --

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  -- uh, the scrambling system in place and there's two separate arguments
over whether we w-, should have an industry standard [beep] [talking] which
many people can build equipment towards or whether we want to have a, uh,
system where --

A.48:  Everybody's separate?  [/breathing] [/noise].

B.49:  -- [Noise] yeah, it's, it's a real serious problem in a situation,
