==========================================================================

A.1:  [Breathing] happen to know what the laws are in Texas?

B.2:  Capital punishment is, uh, you know, ac-, an accepted punishment.  It, it's
legal.

@A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, there are, there have been a number of executions --

A.5:  #Huh.#

B.6:  -- #over# the last few years.  Uh, [sigh] they drag, you know, the, the
appeals drag on interminably it seems sometimes.  Uh, personally, I kept, I
keep thinking that if I could be guaranteed that the people who perpetrate
some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free, then I would not be in
favor of capital punishment.  But, #uh# --

A.7:  #Oh,# I see what you're saying.

B.8:  -- but, uh, when I know that they could be paroled and go right back to
doing what they did before, I, I feel decidedly un, uneasy about it.

A.9:  Huh.

B.10:  What about New York?

A.11:  Well, in New, I'm not quite sure.  But what sounds familiar to me is that
i-, [scratching] it's not legal except in cases of murder of police officers.

B.12:  Uh.  #Okay.#

A.13:  #I# might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  So, uh, so we don't hear about it.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  I was visiting in California recently and apparently they, over about two
weeks ago, they just executed one fellow.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  It is legal there.  But --

B.20:  Yes.

A.21:  -- th-, they always put it off and put it off --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and they finally for the first time in twenty-five years executed
someone.

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  So that was quite the news.

B.26:  I remember reading about that.  Uh.

A.27:  Is it only usually in cases of murder?  Sort of an #eye# --

B.28:  #It# --

A.29:  -- for an eye #kind of a thing.#

B.30:  -- #uh, it's# more than that.  I think it's a capital murder, uh, where
there, there was an intent to do other harm as well, you know.  Where you, you
engaged in another felony like robbery at, at the same time that you murdered
someone.

A.31:  Okay.  I know there's a, a subtle difference between manslaughter and
murder.

B.32:  Yes.

A.33:  I guess you can commit manslaughter by #running somebody# --

B.34:  #By accident.#

A.35:  -- over by accident.

B.36:  Yes.

A.37:  That kind of thing.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  That's my understanding of it.  Uh, but that, uh, murder is
something that you do intentionally.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  Uh.

A.41:  I don't know.  It just seems to me that everybody wants to know if they do
something, what's going to happen to them.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  I substitute teach and I have kids who talk fresh, don't do homework and
they say so what's going to happen to me.  And people getting less and less
respect and they (( )) they know that the bottom line is not very much is
going to happen to them.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  So if I could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution
absolutely did it.  Because, you know, during the --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- the jury system, you're not quite sure --

B.48:  No, you're not.

A.49:  -- you know [laughter].  I, I'd feel comfortable with it #if I# --

B.50:  #Uh-huh.#

A.51:  -- knew absolutely certainly --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- that this person actually murdered someone.  #But# --

B.54:  #Or,# 

A.55:  -- I, I think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we
might be making a mistake and you can't fix it.

B.56:  That's right.  And, and it's a terrible thing to do.  Uh, and the world,
our world seems to become more and more violent all the time.  By the way, I'm
a public school administrator #[laughter] so.#

A.57:  #Okay [laughter].#  Well did you, do you find that the kids are changing
#and that they don't# --

B.58:  #Ooh.#

A.59:  -- th-, they don't respect authority anymore?

B.60:  At all.  They, they do not respect authority.  #Uh# --

A.61:  #I,# 

B.62:  -- they kill for fun.  Uh, they shoot guns for amusement after parties.  
Uh,

A.63:  Huh.  Well, the guns are legal where you are.

B.64:  Yes.

A.65:  It's quite a to do to get a gun around here, legally that is.

B.66:  Well, i-, it's not, it's not legal to carry a handgun in Texas #but,# 

A.67:  #Oh,# I didn't know that.

B.68:  No, it's not, you can have it in your home.

A.69:  Okay.

B.70:  Or in your car if you're traveling from one city to another.  

A.71:  Oh, okay, that clears that.

B.72:  But, uh, rifles, shotguns, those sorts of guns are legal.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  Well, they can do just as much damage.  

B.74:  Oh, yes #[laughter].#  

A.75:  #[Laughter].#

B.76:  It's just that they're harder to hide.  #But I do [laughter]# --

A.77:  #That's true [laughter] [/breathing].#

B.78:  -- I feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our country now.
Not only because we can't be sure that the jury, you know, has made the right
decision.  That the person who did it is really guilty or really isn't guilty
and yet I feel very uncomfortable about the numbers of people who are paroled,
put back on the streets and, within a few months, are raping and killing other
people.
