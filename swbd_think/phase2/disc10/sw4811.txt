A.1:  [Noise] Do you have any thoughts on company benefits?

@B.2:  I do but, uh, they're pretty slanted, I want you to know [laughter].

A.3:  I'm prepared.

B.4:  Uh, my company was bought by another company.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And the majority of us were laid off.  

A.7:  Oh, okay.  I see where this is going [laughter].

B.8:  Uh-huh.  So, you know, uh, what I would like to see, well, the really sad
part of this is that I'm fifty-five years old.

A.9:  That's not bad (( )) [laughter].

B.10:  Beg your pardon?

A.11:  That's not so sad.

B.12:  Oh, my chances of getting another job are just really slim.

A.13:  Um.

B.14:  I was a systems analyst for an oil company.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  And, you know, they just, I mean Sprint had, uh, two thousand jobs ope-, I
mean, I'm sorry, two hundred jobs open, they had two thousand applications for
this type of work.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  You know, it's just, uh, and I guess that's, that's pretty farfetched as
benefits go but gosh, you know, I saw it.  I was fixed for life [laughter].
So, uh,

A.19:  I think more and more people are finding that out.  Even people with state
and, uh, federal jobs.  It, it's a shock.

B.20:  It really is, it really is.  But, uh, I, I think, uh, I guess my feelings
on this are that the, one of the most important benefits we currently have is
our health insurance.

A.21:  That's true.

B.22:  And that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job,
or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company.

A.23:  Isn't there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for
eighteen months?

B.24:  There is, uh-huh.  And, and that's fine.  But, you know, I'm still
unemployed after about fourteen months, okay?

A.25:  Oh, #yeah, that's worrisome.#

B.26:  #And when you switch,# yeah, when you switch over, the, the premiums are
really quite high.  And additionally, I've had a heart attack.  #So# --

A.27:  #Um.#

B.28:  -- it's going to be really tough for me to do this.  So, you know, uh, in,
in my very personal way, I feel that insurance is just one of the most
important benefits we have now.  Now with the poli-, political situation the
way it is, I think that's going to change.

A.29:  You talking about national health?

B.30:  I think we're going to have to have something of that sort.  

A.31:  #Um {very faint}.#

B.32:  #So# that will cease to be as important a benefit.  #What are your# --

A.33:  #I think that# --

B.34:  -- feelings?  What do you #feel?#

A.35:  -- #well, I# think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high
is because people are suing left and right and just driving these costs up.

B.36:  Well, I agree with you.  But, do you know, that's what makes this such a
tremendous benefit.  If you can possible get group rates.

A.37:  Well, I, I have my own beef about health insurance.  I, uh, I'm not a
spring chicken myself #[laughter],#

B.38:  #[Laughter].#

A.39:  quite frankly.  Uh, I raised a family and now I'd like to get back into my
field which is [noise] teaching.  And it's at a time where school budgets are
so far down that they're firing experienced people.  And, also, you know, I'm,
I'm a art teacher which is a very small #field.#

B.40:  #Oh, yes.#

A.41:  Out of a whole school, there's two or three.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  And, you know, there are two hundred applications {mispronounced} for one,
one job.

B.44:  Yep.

A.45:  Uh, you send in a resume and t-, they don't even write a letter to you to
say no thanks, #which,# 

B.46:  #They,# they don't have time.

A.47:  Yeah, I suppose.  And, uh, I do substitute teach and my biggest complaint
is schools get a discount insurance, school districts, because they have so
many people.  Why can't they allow their substitutes to buy into it.  To pay
ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have and they won't
let us.

B.48:  Well, you've, you've approached it?  

A.49:  Yeah.  They don't let you do it.

B.50:  What is their thinking on it?

A.51:  Uh, [sigh] uh, I don't know, I don't know.  #I just, just# --

B.52:  #Have they said?#

A.53:  -- know it's not allowed.

B.54:  Okay.  Have they said we cannot do this because,

A.55:  Yeah.  No, not, th-, they didn't get that far.

B.56:  No because.

A.57:  No because, we, we, we don't do this.  We don't do this.

B.58:  Okay.

A.59:  And everybody thinks it's sort of a crying shame.  I have been divorced
and I knew that, uh, when I was divorced, I was allowed that eighteen months
of insurance on my ex-husband's plan.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  And I was allowed to pay for myself at their lower rate and I don't see
what the school district would have to lose by letting us pay for ourselves.
But,

B.62:  Is, uh, let's see.  Are they paying a part of the premium?  

A.63:  Well, I, they're paying all the premium for their full-time teachers.  

B.64:  Oh, they are.

A.65:  Yeah.  #Yeah, that's part of their salary.#

B.66:  #And have you offered to come in,# have you offered to come in and pay the
whole premium?

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  And they still won't let you?  

A.69:  No, no.  It's just not #policy.#

B.70:  #That's crazy.#

A.71:  Yeah, that just doesn't seem to make any sense.

B.72:  So, what do you do about insurance?

A.73:  Well, I am remarried now and my husband, uh, quit his job to try some
consulting.  He's an engineer.  And what he did was, he j-, you know, if you
join a group sometimes it's a little less.  He joined the Engineers Society or
some #group like that.#

B.74:  #Uh-huh.  Yeah.#

A.75:  And what he did whi-, was actually very clever.  Most people want to have
the lowest deductible and then get eighty percent of their money back and all
of this.  My husband said why don't we take a five hundred dollar deductible.
If we have a little, you know, annual checkup here or there, we can pay that.
That's not the problem.
