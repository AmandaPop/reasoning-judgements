=========================================================================

A.1:  (( )) Capital punishment, uh, I guess, out in California is, has had a lot
of, uh, a lot of, you know, discourse in the paper.  Uh, apparently, you know,
there's, they haven't, uh, executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, I
believe.

@B.2:  [Clicking] [rustling] Uh, yeah. That's, that's as far back as I can
remember [laughter].  #Well, that's before# --

A.3:  #Yeah, they,# 

B.4:  -- my time actually.

A.5:  Well, I, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in Redwood City when we
were out there.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And, uh, and we found that, uh [throat_clearing] you know, it was a very
liberal kind of community.  But the, uh, I, I really feel that, that the law
enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars and then
they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together and
they, uh, they, I think, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process.  Uh,
you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh,
demise out for ten or fifteen years.  Uh, and I, I think that, uh, that
there's something that has to be changed in the system to, to do that.  I
think capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough but I think
the appeal process is really getting in the way.

B.8:  [Music] Uh-huh.

A.9:  Do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, [throat_clearing] more, uh,
was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable
by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?

B.10:  Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the
laws are enforceable or not, it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty
itself.  It's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're
going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And nothing is being done about it.  Uh, the laws exist and (( )) are
frequently upheld in, in, uh, in Appeals Court just because of technicalities
[swallowing] and because of maybe small little holes that their defending
attorney can find.  And it's, it's really getting out of hand (( )) in many
states.

A.13:  Well, [throat_clearing] the term technicality (( )).  The law enforcement
community,

B.14:  [Rustling]. 

A.15:  uh, uh, you know, has to, has to separate the difference between somebody
who is being set up in which, uh, grievous {mispronounced} acts are done to,
uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going to
be guilty of, of a crime.

B.16:  [Noise].

A.17:  Or whether, uh, an-, and whether the rights of that individual are been,
have been, you know, impuned.  Uh, but [throat_clearing] or whether there's
just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, [noise] a, you know, a non, a
noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it but, but, you know,
the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know,

B.18:  [Talking.] 

A.19:  the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive.  Now, I, I'm, a-, a-, at
this juncture I, you know, I'm, I'm not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a
technicality.  You know, that, that's what all c-, these, these hearings are
about and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about.  I mean our,
uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in Washington is six days away
from getting out of, out of the can and, uh, [throat_clearing] you know, he,
he tried to appeal his conviction.  Uh, and, you know, it didn't work.  But be
that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process
dry.  Uh, in, in the old days, you know, and say round about times of battle
of Hastings, you know, and the ((villages)) if you were a transgressor, they,
they either, you know, drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of
somebody and he, you were his slave.  And if he didn't like what you did, he
killed you.

B.20:  [Noise].  

A.21:  And that has, that's pretty effective.  Uh, you know, it's not good for
civil rights, I guess, but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got
to get along in the community and if you don't you'll perish.  Either by the
hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods.  So, I,
I, I mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh,
imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by,
uh, civilian authority in, in so-, in criminal actions, especially, you know,
murder cases and that sort of thing.

B.22: Well, it seems like [cough], well it, it seems as if in the past
typically [talking] there have been a lot of cases of people being
wrongly tried or wrongly punished. and the whole idea behind the
current criminal process system [swallowing] is to protect those who
((actually)) didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in
that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who
are guilty are getting off.  Um, for instance, um there's a case a few
years back where, uh, [swallowing] someone, uh, someone who's being
convicted for, was under a tri-, was going to trial for murder, was
let off because of a technicality in that.  The of-, the arresting
officer, uh, did not read the defendant their rights.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  And where his,

A.25:  [Throat_clearing].

B.26:  old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, the, everything was
conclusively pointing to this individual yet [/music],
