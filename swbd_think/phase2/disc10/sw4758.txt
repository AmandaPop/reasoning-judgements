===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I'm, are you there?

B.2:  Yes, yes.

@A.3:  Okay.  I'm sure that I probably, uh, prescribe to different magazines ones
that you do [laughter].  I take DOLL READER and DOLL WORLD [laughter].

B.4:  Different set [laughter] [noise].

A.5:  Because I collect dolls [laughter].  Uh, I also take BETTER HOMES AND
GARDENS.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  [Swallowing] I like that.  And then, uh, my husband, he just, uh,
subscribed to a wood, he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get
some woodworking books.

B.8:  Oh.  #(( )).#

A.9:  #So# what kind do you, uh, get?

B.10:  Well I have a bunch of computer journals --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- because I'm in computer science but beyond that, uh, lately I've been
reading, I've always liked the NEW YORKER.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And lately I've been picking up some of the travel, uh, both trade
magazines and just the general travel magazines.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Uh, trying to keep up on what's going on.  #(( )) my# --   

A.17:  #Is it,# 

B.18:  -- wife also gets a lot of the food magazines.  BON APPETITE, and FOOD #AND
WINE and GOURMET.#

A.19:  #Yeah, I used to# take that.  Right.

B.20:  Yeah.  And she still likes to get TIME --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- which I've never liked very much but she seems to.

A.23:  Yeah.  I don't, I, if I, you know, if I happen to find it, I'll go ahead
and read it someplace, you know, if I'm in a doctor's office or something like
that but other than that I never, I never liked that really.

B.24:  Do you read a newspaper?

A.25:  I read my newspaper.  

B.26:  #[Laughter].#

A.27:  #I can hardly# wait in the mornings for the #newspaper# --

B.28:  #Yeah.#

A.29:  -- to get here, you know.  So I do like to read the newspaper.  Uh, even
this little newspaper that Patterson puts out.  In fact, it puts it out on
Tuesdays and Thursdays [sniffing]. I can hardly wait to get that to get the
local news [laughter].  But, uh, other than that, magazines, I don't know.
There's so much advertising in them anymore.

B.30:  [Laughter] Some of them I used to get for the advertising.  Like BYTE
magazine which is, uh, #one of the# --

A.31:  #Oh, okay.#

B.32:  -- larger computer ones.  I haven't bought it now for about eight years.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  But when I used to get it, it was about five hundred pages, about three
hundred of them advertising.

A.35:  Huh.

B.36:  Because that was interesting.  I think a lot of the trade magazines are
like that.

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.38:  That, that half the fun is finding out what all the products are.

A.39:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.40:  But, you know, some of the get ridiculous.  TRAVEL AND LEISURE, all of the
AMERICAN EXPRESS magazines --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- so TRAVEL AND LEISURE, FOOD AND WINE and I think they have some others,
uh, certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the
advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but
are paid for and,

A.43:  #[Laughter].#

B.44:  #[Laughter] it is,# it's clear that, I, I've bought some of these
through wholesalers [noise] and they don't care if they make any money on the
magazine subscription, they're making everything on ads.

A.45:  Yeah, right, right.  Yeah, well I, I only, you know, subscribe to the
things I'm interested in.  I used to be into coin collecting so I used to get
the coin magazine, the paper actually is what it was, you know.  I used to get
that.  So now that I'm into dolls, that's about --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- all I really, really want, you know.

B.48:  Have you ever, uh, read or subscribe to CONSUMER REPORTS for any length of
time?

A.49:  No, huh-uh.  Uh, I think they're interesting.    

B.50:  [Laughter] But not worth it.

A.51:  Yeah [laughter].

B.52:  I, I've always had this, one of the reasons I like just to pick up
magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different
perspective.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  So I've always had this problem with CONSUMER REPORTS that in the areas
that I know a lot about, I disagree with them.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every
area disagreeing with them on everything,

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  or, or what's going on [laughter]. 

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  So I, like I've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent,
uh, organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start
reading from their perspective.  Uh, you know, their major interest is in
commissions and, you know, there's very little talk about the quality of
places or airlines.  Their major talk is about, you know, commissions and
commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the
commission's not a, the full ten percent or whatever it is and --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- it gives you a different [laughter] perspective on what people do.

A.63:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well those travel magazines, are that, more or less, show
you different countries that you could go to or,

B.64:  Uh, some of them.  The, the general travel magazines do.  I don't tend to
read it for that.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  Because I don't expect to be traveling overseas in, in the future for quite
awhile.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  But I, I usually just read through the sections on, on domestic stuff.

A.69:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Okay.  Well I don't know any other magazines I could talk
to you about.

B.70:  No.

A.71:  Uh, I don't take anymore than that [laughter].

B.72:  Yeah.  I don't take much more in myself.

A.73:  You know, so.

B.74:  #Okay.#

A.75:  #Well# I guess that will be it then #and,# 

B.76:  #Okay,# nice talking to you.
