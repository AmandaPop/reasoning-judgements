=========================================================================

A.1:  As far as news and, uh, keeping up with it, I get a subscription to TIME,
NEWSWEEK and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT and I also stay in touch with C N N
whenever there's something interesting happening in the world.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  Do you actually read all those magazines every week?

A.3:  Oh, [laughter] Don, I get [laughter] a lot more than that.  Those are just
the news magazines that I get.  I barely have time.  I usually tear through,
uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT, that's my least favorite.  I think I like
NEWSWEEK the most.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  Well I, uh, I pa-, I keep up with what's going on by listening to
the radio in the car and reading a newspaper, a daily newspaper, and I, I
pretty much hardly ever, uh, see news on television.

A.5:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah, I, I've, if you're near Boston, uh, I, I remember
hearing in the car, we can pick up W B Z pretty good --

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  -- out here in Rochester.  We, I also get the morning paper here.  Uh, we,
we're Gannett town so we have a morning and a afternoon paper.  Both owned by
Gannett.

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  I tend to read the morning paper just because it's more breaking news.  I
also listen to short wave depending upon what the world conditions are like.

B.10:  Oh, so you can pick up RADIO MOSCOW or that sort of thing, huh?

A.11:  Oh, yeah, RADIO MOSCOW.  It, it's gotten a lot stranger #[laughter],#

B.12:  #[Laughter].#

A.13:  in the last several years.  They've added commercials and they have bad
jingles and everything #[laughter].#

B.14:  #[Laughter]#  That's pretty much like U S radio, huh.

A.15:  Well, that's what they're trying to emulate.  I think most people still
head for the B B C WORLD SERVICE #which, uh# --

B.16:  #Yeah.#

A.17:  -- I, I like that for international news.  But sometimes it gets, you know,
usually if something major happens now, I head for C N N.

B.18:  That, uh, the B B C WORLD SERVICES broadcasts on the F M band in, near the
Boston area --

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  They have, it's, it's distributed through American Public Radio
I guess and,

B.20:  -- by our public radio station.

A.21:  Yeah, they have a #feed of that.  Yeah# --

B.22:  #Still (( )).#

A.23:  -- you can also, a lot of various, C SPAN has an audio service [noise]
which transmits the B B C WORLD SERVICE twenty-four hours a day.  You know, I,
in i-, the only problem with, that I have with getting the news from a lot of
these places is probably the worst lately has become the newspaper because I,
I just despise fluff journalism [swallowing] --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- you know.  I mean Iraq is bombed but no you're not going to see that
today because here's Janey, age five on the front page blowing bubbles, you
know [laughter].

B.26:  Right.  Or here's, uh, one presidential cani-, candidate saying rude things
about the other one's girlfriend or something, [noise] yeah.

A.27:  Yeah, I, i-, it, you know the worst of them all is U S A TODAY which is
only [laughter], I call it useless today, the (( )) paper [laughter].

B.28:  Right [laughter].

A.29:  #[Laughter] It's great.#  

B.30:  #Well, they, they, uh,# they have a pretty small vocabulary, don't they.
They,

A.31:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  It's about the six grade.  It's basically a newspaper
for those that watch T V [laughter].

B.32:  Yeah, that's true.  

A.33:  #[Sniffing] But in,# 

B.34:  #It's# pretty tough to find objective, straight forward news.  I mean the,
the B B C -s got their own slant.  I mean their basically. you know, they're,
they're, I think they're addressing their U S service to, to Brits living
here.

A.35:  Yeah.  That, that's pretty, they have some pretty obscure international
[laughter] news.  I mean like coming up next, a five minute report on Nepal,
you know [laughter].

B.36:  Yeah, they do, they do good stuff on Nepal and South Africa.  You can get
good stuff on and, you know, India and, but, it's not necessarily close to
stuff I'm looking for.  They tend to make fun of the U S a lot, I think
[laughter].

A.37:  Oh, yeah.  It's, th-, they have a LETTER FROM AMERICA. I think it's
Alastair Cooke who, um, who's been doing that program forever, who comments
on what life in America is like and, uh, most British seem more amused than
anything else #[laughter].#

B.38:  #[Laughter]# Well, [laughter] maybe they're right, #what the heck
[laughter].#

A.39:  #[Laughter]# So, yeah, I, I tend to, we have cable here and that tends to
be pretty good for news but I also have a satellite dish so I, you can watch
some pretty strange news things that feeds on there.  Especially during, uh,
the Iraqi war where you could hear the anchor people, you know, screaming four
letter words, poor Burney Shaw [laughter].

B.40:  Yeah.  Do they, uh, d-, do you use any electronic type news services like
a, you know, computer network news services, anything like that?

A.41:  [Noise] ((Oh)), I, I have a, uh, you know, I, I found out about the service
on Comp, DCom, Telecom so we have access to, you know, there's, there's, uh,
CLARA NEWS and you can also get on COMPU BUCKS and read the #news wires# --

B.42:  #(( )).#

A.43:  -- on there which, you know, I appreciate that one.  If I want to search
for a particular topic, you know, that #I know,# 

B.44:  #(( ))# service then?

A.45:  Yeah.  Either that or you can go on CLARA NEWS and use it, or I'm sorry,
uh, COMPUSERVE and use their executive news service if you want to follow,
you know, certain key words and I use to do that when we were interested in
following the cable industry.  You know, you wouldn't see this stuff in the
local paper.

B.46:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't get the,
