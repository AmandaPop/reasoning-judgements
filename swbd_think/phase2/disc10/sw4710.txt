B.1:  Well, Kirk, uh, I believe in capital punishment.  I'm from Texas and we
have that in, in effect down here.

@A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  And, uh, I guess I'm kind of the old school, you know.  An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.

A.4:  Uh-huh.  Do you have a, has Texas always had capital punishment?  Have they
ever had a period where they outlawed it?

B.5:  Uh, no sir.  Not to my knowledge.  Uh, they've always it.

A.6:  I see.  Right from day one?

B.7:  Uh-huh.  

A.8:  I'd have to confess to you that, uh, I don't know what the, I honestly
don't what the law in Maryland is.  I think we have, [noise] I think we have a
capital murder law.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  Uh, I think that's probably the only crime for which, you know, capital
punishment is meted out.

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  My own, I guess my own personal feelings are, r-, r-, I tend to take a look
at the social cost benefit ratio which sounds kind of callous.  But, uh,
basically, you know, is, what, what is the net, the net benefit to society if
you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for
the rest of their lives or something of that sort.  And, in many cases, I
decide in favor of capital punishment.  In fact I think in most cases
[laughter], uh, and there probably be a few instances in which I would think
that maybe it wasn't warranted.

B.13:  Well, well, 

A.14:  [Throat_clearing].

B.15:  uh, Kirk, is capital punishment, is that like death, death?

A.16:  That, that's death.

B.17:  Yeah, right.

A.18:  #Right.#

B.19:  #Uh-huh.#  Uh-huh.

A.20:  And, uh, let's see, Texas uses death by lethal injection now right?

B.21:  Well, uh, the, death by the electric chair.  Uh, and, uh, let's see, the
last time that I was, uh, privy to it, death by electric chair.

A.22:  Oh, I see.  #Okay.#

B.23:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.24:  #I see.#

B.25:  #You# see, one of our problems is down here,

A.26:  [Cough].

B.27:  since we were one of the later states to join [swallowing] --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- is that, uh, murder was, I mean, uh, horse, horse thieving and, was
rampant down #here in the old days.#

A.30:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.31:  And I bet you can go to any town within the state and find a hanging tree.

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  And you know, you stole somebody's, uh, horses or, uh, stole their 
cattle --

A.34:  Uh-huh.

B.35:  -- that was a capital offense and you got hanged from the nearest limb if,
uh, you know, you were caught.

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  So, it's got, it goes back to the old days.  Now I don't know about
Maryland, uh, golly, what they did in the old days.

A.38:  Well Maryland's a pretty complicated state #[laughter].#

B.39:  #Uh-huh.#

A.40:  Because it's a, well because of its colonial, you know, background and
then, of course, during the Civil or during, prior and during the Civil War,
it was a border state, you know.  With half the state northern and half the
state southern --

B.41:  Uh-huh.  

A.42:  -- you know, in sentiment and so forth.  I suspect that like most, most
states, uh, you know, in the nineteenth century and so forth, that they
certainly had capital punishment.

B.43:  Yeah.  Right {very faint}.

A.44:  Uh, it's not a Quaker state or something of that sort, you know, like
Pennsylvania.

B.45:  Right.  Uh-huh.

A.46:  But, uh, and as I said, I think we, we have a, a capital murder law on the
books right now.  I guess my feeling, you know, I can set up some hypothetical
cases where, uh, well suppose there was, s-, uh, you know, a famous, uh,
medical researcher who murdered his wife --

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  -- you know.  Now this, you know, the question is what is the prospects of
this medical researcher making medical break throughs that might benefit human
beings in the future, never mind that he murdered his wife.

B.49:  Is that what you meant awhile ago, uh, when you said, you know, bou-,
about, uh, putting them in prison?  Actually, what you meant, what kind of
contribution can they make if you don't murder them.

A.50:  Right.

B.51:  Right.

A.52:  You know, and I, I, I think I'd have to sit down and say well what kind of
contribution would they make.

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  And also, #what# --

B.55:  #Right.#

A.56:  -- what do you, I think another element in it, in it is what kind of
society do you, what, what message are you trying to send to society.

B.57:  Yeah.

A.58:  I mean, like in the, uh, I, I'm actually in favor of things like, uh, if
you're going to execute somebody, you, uh, I don't see any reason why they
shouldn't televise it --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- you know or what have you.  #It's# --

B.61:  #Yeah.#

A.62:  -- uh, it, uh, uh, you know, people ought to be aware of what it is that,
you know, what it is that they're doing.  And, uh, you know, what, what the
sentence really means when you, uh, you know, if you sentence somebody to
death, this is what it really means.  Just like they show you what prisons are
supposedly like.  Uh, #they,# 

B.63:  #(( )).#

A.64:  Pardon?

B.65:  Well, you, you know, you have the Christian view.

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  And the Christian view is to forgive, you know.

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  And, uh,

A.70:  [Throat_clearing].

B.71:  and maybe try to re-, rehabilitate.

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  And, of course, when you do that, you know, then your costs go up on that
measure and those who have lost someone, uh, you know, feel like the, that,
uh, the guy's escaped justice.

A.74:  Uh-huh.

B.75:  And, uh, so #you,#

A.76:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.77:  know, I can see that point too.  #I'm# --

A.78:  #Uh-huh.#

B.79:  -- just kind of the old line that, uh, I believe that if you go out and
kill your neighbor, you know, you can look to lose your own life.

A.80:  Sure.  #Uh, [throat_clearing],# 

B.81:  #And it's true# that, uh, some people, uh, you know, uh, go out and commit
a murder and they could really, uh,
