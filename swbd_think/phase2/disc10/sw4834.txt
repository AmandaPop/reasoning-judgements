============================================================================

A.1:  [Throat_clearing] I guess, I guess by what you said you're, you don't feel
you're, uh, privacy has been inva-, invaded anytime recently?

@B.2:  No, not really.  Uh, u-, th-, uh, th-, the only thing that annoys me is
when, uh, people call and they, uh, you have solicitation calls.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  That's the only thing that bothers me.  That's not really invading my
privacy [laughter].

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  Uh, {pause} do you feel that yours is invaded?

A.7:  Uh, no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means.  Uh, you know,
I would, there, there's a lot of times though, uh, you get those calls and,
you know, when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or, or whatnot and, you
know, next thing you know, uh, someone calls and wants to sell you this or
that and it's real hard to, to tell them, you know, that you're not
interested.  Or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep
asking you, you know, and keep badgering you about it, and that aggravates me.
But I don't know that you could call that invading of, invading my privacy
because, [throat_clearing] you know, if we don't want that to happen all we
have to do is just call the phone company and say, look, you know, I want my
name unlisted or want #my, you know,# 

B.8:  #But, but that# doesn't work.

A.9:  It doesn't?

B.10:  Uh, no, because they, a lot of times they dial sequentially.  They get your
name from, uh, if you enter any type of contest or anything.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Uh, you know, you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a
shopping spree or something, you put your phone number on there, they pass
your phone number on to another company.

A.13:  Oh.

B.14:  Uh, or you, uh, or, or like the newspapers, they just dial randomly or s-,
and stuff.  They even call, the newspapers here even call people who already
subscribe #[laughter].#

A.15:  #[Laughter].#

B.16:  And, uh, while I was subscribing to the paper, I got so upset at them #that
they# --

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  -- you call me one more time, I'm going to stop subscribing #[laughter].#

A.19:  #[Laughter].#

B.20:  And the lo-, local, local papers (( )) ask them to remove your na-, number
from their list and, uh, yeah, you call up their regular, during regular hours
their, uh, they have a special department, they'll take your numbers out of
their lists.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Uh, but the, uh, Orlando paper, uh, yeah, they, they refused to take it off
of the lists and they call every month.

A.23:  Huh.

B.24:  And when you have more than one phone number, you get a call on each number
you have [laughter].

A.25:  [Laughter] Good grief.  Well, let me ask you about this.  Here's something
that, uh, has been kind of concerning me lately.  My fiance received a bill
from a, a Lord and Taylor company,

B.26:  [Noise].  

A.27:  Uh, you know, they're a, they're a department store.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  She received a bill from them, uh, that she had visited some sto-, and, and
I think it was there in Florida, maybe it was in Miami.  That, uh, she had
visited a store there and, uh, they had this bill, uh, that she had bought
such and such amount of merchandise, uh, over two hundred dollars worth of
merchandise.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  Uh, and the date that, that she supposedly made this purchase, she was in
Denver with me for Thanksgiving.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Uh, and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security
number.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Uh, and, and I've, I've heard recently that, uh, uh, that this is a common
occurrence where people are using s-, you know, they use Joe Blow's so-, uh,
social security number, uh, and can, uh, potentially ruin someone's credit.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  If you know a person's social security number and their mailing
address, i-, and their mother's maiden name #[laughter],#

A.37:  #[Laughter].#

B.38:  uh, you can, basically, become that, uh, person.

A.39:  Huh.

B.40:  Uh, if the purchase was made mail order, they should have a record of where
it was shipped to --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- and since it wasn't shipped to her address, she could prove, you know,
that it wasn't her.  Uh, if it was ((some)) you know, coming into the store
and stuff, then she would ha-, whoever made the purchase would have ((had))
find some kind of, uh, you know, document --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- and, uh, wh-, the signature, uh, they should be able to provide you a
copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature, you know,
they'll have to eat the charge [laughter].

A.45:  Yeah.  #Well, y-,# 

B.46:  #But# if the pers-, has, you know, their social s-, her social security
number, I'd be real concerned that they, uh, that she's not, uh, blacklist on,
uh, Tel-, what is it, it's Telecredit or something?

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Uh, because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify
through there.  She probably won't be ab-, able to open a checking account or
anything without a lot of hassle.

A.49:  Yeah.  Well, we got it cleared up eventually.  What happened, uh,
