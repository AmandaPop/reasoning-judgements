B.1:  Okay [breathing]. 

A.2:  Uh, do you have any particular, uh, ideas #about our# --

B.3:  #Yes.#

A.4:  -- funding of AIDS research?

@B.5:  Yes.  I think it's important that we, uh, either make a special tax for it
or implement the money toward that away from other areas.  It's going to be
such [sigh] an amazing in-, insurmountable, you can't even imagine the cost
it's going to cost to take care of these people.  An-, and if they can find a
resource, of course, they can cut the pain and suffering but, if anything, the
cost, [noise] they're going to save a fortune just implementing that money
toward that.

A.6:  Do you think it's more important than cancer or something else simply
because th-, the numbers are so large?

B.7:  Yes, I do.  

A.8:  #((Huh)).#

B.9:  #Oh, well,# cancer, the numbers are larger.  

A.10:  Okay.

B.11:  Uh, however, AIDS has the opportunity to become, to become larger than
cancer.

A.12:  Huh.

B.13:  Within a very quick time.

A.14:  Course, my thought leads to, you know, I have, uh, school age kids.

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  Uh, I think a, a good amount of money ought to go to the education which
they, they seem to be doing.

B.17:  Uh-huh.  #I agree [sniffing].#

A.18:  #Uh, because# I think you want to stop it before it gets, you know, it's
not the kind of thing you can reverse if, you have got to stop it before it
starts.

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  Something in, inside me upsets me to think that there, there are lots of
diseases in, in my husband's family there's a genetic disease.

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  Why aren't people making a stink about that and, you know, and curing, you
know, making this gung ho rally to cure that?

B.23:  I think it's because the sheer numbers.  I really think it's that.

A.24:  It's a scare also.

B.25:  It is.  Uh, AIDS is a major topic right now.  It's trendy, it's in the
news, it's in everybody's point of view.  But until you have really worked
with it and seen it --

A.26:  Oh, I'm sure #it's devastating.#

B.27:  -- #that's the difference.#  It is, it is.  

A.28:  And, and there, there is a real scare, a real fear.  

B.29:  #Uh-huh [sniffing].#

A.30:  #You# don't know, 

B.31:  [Sniffing].

A.32:  you know how dangerous it could be.  I had answered a, uh, job ad, we have
a local V A hospital down here --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- and they, they needed a lab assistant and I'm working part-time now.
I'm a substitute teacher.

B.35:  Right.

A.36:  Uh, but, you know, I get calls sporadically and they needed this lab
assistance in the neighborhood and said you didn't have to have experience.
I'm really an artist but I figured oh, you know, I'll find out what it is.
And she, she very casually said well think about whether you want to this
because there are lab animals and blah, blah, blah and th-, uh, you might be
exposed to AIDS in the animals but, you know, you would have gloves and this
and that and it did make me flinch.  It did make me not want to do that
[laughter].

B.37:  Well I remember the first time I worked with an AIDS patient.  I was
terrified, I have to admit it.  And I know #educationally wise# --

A.38:  #(( )) [laughter].#

B.39:  -- everything I'm supposed to know.  

A.40:  Right.

B.41:  And it still scared me.  

A.42:  Sure.  But, I, ge-, you know, these, these were lab animals.  I'm not crazy
about rats to begin with.  I mean, but here's humans, you can feel compassion
for them [sniffing].

B.43:  That's true.  But you would be surprised how many nurses don't.

A.44:  Oh [sigh] #I don't know.#

B.45:  #I'm not kidding.#

A.46:  Yeah, I guess it, people will do anything, you know, just because it's a
job and they have to make a salary but,

B.47:  I, I work in a public, a county hospital and, uh, well, first of all, most
of those nurses there are L V N -s because the pay is bad for them --

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  -- and th-, they don't have many R N -s and very few B S N -s --

A.50:  Huh.

B.51:  -- so [sigh],

A.52:  The care is shoddy.

B.53:  The care is shoddy.  Yes.  Uh, th-, the compassion is low, the hours are
long and there is a lot of people.  So they tend to isolate them and leave
them for #a large amount.#

A.54:  #Right, yeah.  How# can you feel when there's a sign on your door
[laughter] you know.  #((Is it)),# 

B.55:  #Huh?#

A.56:  There, there's usually a sign on the door saying quarantined or something,
you know or,

B.57:  [Throat_clearing] Yes they're in isolation [talking].  

A.58:  Sure.

B.59:  They certainly are.  

A.60:  I'm sure a big part of it is, uh, they, they suffer mentally as well as
physically.

B.61:  They definitely do.

A.62:  [Sigh].

B.63:  They definitely do.

A.64:  Yeah.  You know, it, it just, when, when I see a headline that says that
we're giving twenty-five billion to Russia because, you know, they need to eat
better --

B.65:  #I know.#

A.66:  -- #and then# we've got so many problems at home.

B.67:  ((And we)), our debt.  I, I'm just #so concerned.#

A.68:  #Wha-, where is# this?  You know, my husband says well they're printing up
more, you know #[laughter].#

B.69:  #I know.#

A.70:  I don't kn-, wh-, where is it coming from?  #Do they ask us?#

B.71:  #They're ((foolishly)) spending it.#  I know.

A.72:  [Laughter].  

B.73:  But who are, I mean, where are they spending this money, #you know?#

A.74:  #Well I# don't know how we could spend it when we owe so much.  I don't
understand, #you know.#

B.75:  #Me either.#

A.76:  You would think it balances,

B.77:  [Sniffing].

A.78:  you know, you don't have it, you can't spend it but we seem to.

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  It's a mystery.

B.81:  Yes, we do.  #Yes# --

A.82:  #Uh.#

B.83:  -- we do.

A.84:  So I guess you're saying you think we should spend more for AIDS research.

B.85:  #Uh, I,# 

A.86:  #I'm not, I# don't really know what we are spending actually.

B.87:  Uh, that's exactly what I was going to say.  I don't really know how much
we're spending.  It may be one of those things that takes twenty years to find
anyway.  #Or fifty.#

A.88:  #Oh.# Well I hate to think there's, you know, it seems that anytime a
bureaucracy works on something they waste a lot of money on administration
costs [laughter].

B.89:  Oh, I know.

A.90:  And a study of how to do this can cost millions of dollars #[laughter].#

B.91:  #[Laughter]#  Instead of just trying it [laughter] [sniffing].

A.92:  Right.  Uh,

B.93:  I don't know, uh,

A.94:  I imagine,
