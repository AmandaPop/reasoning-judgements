=========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think about capital punishment?

@B.2:  Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes.  

A.3:  Yeah.  Which crimes do you feel that?

B.4:  Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it.  

A.5:  Yeah.  Because of, so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent --

B.6:  Right.

A.7:  -- ((selling, I think)) should also.

B.8:  Exactly.  Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or --

A.9:  Yeah [noise].

B.10:  -- whatever.  I come from a state that has, well I originally come from the
state that has, uh, [sniffing] the death penalty.  I come from Florida.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And, uh, they're pretty liberal on it.  They tend to, like, fry people left
and right.

A.13:  Yeah #that's,# 

B.14:  #which,# go ahead.

A.15:  Go ahead.  Texas is too.  Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has
had forty-six in like the past several years.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess.  They do it by lethal injection,
#at Huntsville.#

B.18:  #Yeah, okay.#  I think Florida still uses electric chair.

A.19:  Yeah [noise].  

B.20:  Uh, I don't, I don't know.  In some ways I don't like it because it's like
they're playing God.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  And that's not, I don't think that's right.  But on the other hand, there's
a lot of advantages to it.

A.23:  [Noise] Yeah.

B.24:  I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it and, of course, you
have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not.
#Um,# --

A.25:  #Yeah.#

B.26:  -- with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail
that they have to let them out every year.  #They,# 

A.27:  #Yeah.# That's what's happening here.  There is, like, uh, that's, in fact,
a big gubernatorial issue is the --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- the turnover rates of, uh, r-, uh, repeat offenders being let out and
#doing it again.#

B.30:  #Sure.  And it's like,# you know, that's a big problem but there's not a
whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can 
build --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and it's really, you know, it's, it gets to be a r-, a big problem.  

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Uh, #go ahead.#

A.35:  #I wish# if they were going to do it, they would be a little more
consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  Be a little more, you know, not being able to put it off for fifteen years.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in and
they, they get off for good behavior and, I don't know, up in Minnesota where
I am now, they don't have the death penalty.  And you can almost sense that
people are just laughing at the system, you know.  Because they figure well,
you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something.
Uh, but then for, if I, if I ((elicit)) good behavior I'm out in maybe five or
ten.

A.39:  Oh, really?

B.40:  Oh, sure, #you know.#

A.41:  #Goodness.#

B.42:  I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in
the jails --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early.

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh, I don't
know, I think that may solve a lot of that.

A.47:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.48:  Maybe not solve it, but, I don't know, #maybe (( )),#

A.49:  #I, yeah I tend# to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a
little, little too lenient.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  What do you do Georgeanne?

A.53:  I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas.

B.54:  Oh, okay.  Great.  What program you in?

A.55:  Uh, audiology.

B.56:  Okay.  Fantastic.  #Uh# --

A.57:  #Yeah.#  What do you do?

B.58:  -- I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida.

A.59:  Oh, really.

B.60:  Yeah, I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell.

A.61:  Oh really?

B.62:  Uh, #yeah.#

A.63:  #Neat.#

B.64:  But, uh, I don't know.  It's, it's an interesting issue.  There's, like you
say, in Texas there's been quite a few and, and in Florida in the last few
years, I think there's been a lot.  I can't, I, you know, I can't give you
figures but, uh,

A.65:  Yeah.  I just, this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas
chamber [throat_clearing] in California.

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  So, I think it, the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is
what --

B.68:  Oh, is that right?

A.69:  -- they gave a run down that Texas --

B.70:  Okay.

A.71:  -- Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined #area ((then)).#

B.72:  #Yeah, I, I kind of,# yeah, I've heard things about that.  I've heard that
they don't mess around very much.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  (( )) {very faint}.

A.75:  Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do.  

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Like the guy in California got thir-, you know, twice before he went to the
gas chamber and then they said okay, no, you don't have to go.  And then they
took him back.  I mean, #it just seems,# 

B.78:  #Jeez,# that's a lot of repeals.

A.79:  Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent.  And then you have like two,
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death
sentence back when --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- ever you know.  

B.82:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would
warrant it.  Uh, I guess, what is it, what's the policy now with treason?  Do
they, uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence?

A.83:  No, I don't, I don't think, uh, the military doesn't execute anymore so.

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  Or death before the firing squad or whatever.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  So, I think about the only one is, uh, rape,
