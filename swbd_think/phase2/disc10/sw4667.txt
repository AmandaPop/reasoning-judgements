A.1:  Okay.  Well I, how do you feel about that?

B.2:  I think it's great.  Uh, I think, like socialized medicine? 

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, I think i-, it's a very good idea personally, because right now I don't
have any health insurance at all.  And I just know that it's fir-, I could get
it where I work an-, but it would be like a hundred dollars a month which is a
lot to me and I really just can't afford it.  Uh, I have worked places where I
had insurance but, you know, on a more, I work for a very small company now
and I, I realize that, you know, it would, for that to be true you'd, you'd
have to increase taxes and stuff like that but, uh, I know other people that
are, you know, in the same situation and when it's just, uh, I, if you don't
work for a large company, it's really hard to have insurance.  Uh, I would be
willing to, you know, pay more taxes [talking] but, uh, and I, I think it's
just, I think everybody should have the option to have health care.  I mean I
don't think, you know, but the only way to do that would be to, you know, have
to tax more.

A.5:  Yeah, the-, there would have to be some way to pay for it.  The, the, I
agree with you that, that, uh, it's no fun to, uh, not have insurance.  I'm,
I've had health insurance through my, uh, either my parents, uh, employment or
my employment for many years but, uh, now I'm looking s-, at a layoff
situation and I'm sitting here saying well how much is it going to cost me.

B.6:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.7:  The, uh, the prospect of [sigh] going without health insurance is, is, uh,
not very exciting to me either.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  Uh, th-, the problem, 

B.10:  [Talking]. 

A.11:  that I have with, with, uh, universal health insurance is the problem of,
basically, just absolute and complete distrust of for the politicians.
They'll start, I mean, they could, [swallowing] they could say we're going to
do it the right way in the beginning --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and convince me.  But I don't have a lot of faith that they would, uh,
that they would not use it as a, as a, uh,

B.14:  [Talking].

A.15:  oh, as a carrot to get votes.  Uh, my, I called and asked, uh, the, uh,
unemployment insurance people here,

B.16:  [Talking]. 

A.17:  I said how long, you know, what's the unem-, what do I get if I'm
unemployed and how long will I get it.  You know, it's very interesting
[laughter].  The guy on the other end is a young man, he said, uh, uh, with a
good sense of humor, he says, well, he says, right now it is twenty-six weeks,
uh, in periods of severe unemployment and just before an election, they will
extend it and get all the votes of the people that, that like that but he
says, in your case, uh, if you're going, uh, to be needing it in a little
while, by the time you get to the end of your twenty-six weeks, uh, the
elections will be over and yo-, we won't have it anymore, I can tell you that
#[laughter].#

B.18:  #Uh-huh.#

A.19:  So I, so I'm, uh, I'm, for the first time I'm, I'm seeing things to a, uh,
I'm paying attention to things that I never paid be-, --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- uh, #attention to.#

B.22:  #Yeah, you don't# really think about it until you, you're in a situation
where you have to think about it.

A.23:  On the other hand, like I say, tha-, I have, I have lived in places where
they had, uh, free medical care [sigh] and I have to say that, that, uh, that
it, that it was, uh, it was comforting to know that you had it but, but the
way it worked in practice was that, uh, in order to get enough doctors, the,
uh, they used a lot of student doctors.  A lot more than people would put up
with over here.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  And, uh, my wife has dozens and dozens of stories of people that went in
for a simple operation and then died on the table because of --

B.26:  Um.

A.27:  -- the incompetent care [inhaling] so I'm, an-, and she didn't have any axe
to grind, you know.  She just grew up in that situation and said well that's
the way it is and, uh, so on the one hand I, I'm, [swallowing] I'm saying
well, [lipsmack] now I know how people that don't have insurance feel and on
the other hand, I'm saying, uh, I don't trust the politicians very much.  I
think that they are very good at, at, uh, I think they're so corrupt that they
just use it as a vote getting,

B.28:  [Throat_clearing] U-,

A.29:  uh, situation and they don't pay, an-, and they don't make it a very, uh,
there's not a lot of integrity to the things that they do.

B.30:  Well, by the, uh, the same note of what you're saying.  There could be pros
in that situation, uh,
