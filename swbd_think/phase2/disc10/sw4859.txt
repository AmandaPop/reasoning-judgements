=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, generally I get, uh, you know, most of my news, uh, in the, you
know, weekly magazines like TIME, NEWSWEEK and, and, uh, U S NEWS AND WORLD
REPORT.  With, with occasional smatterings of, of, uh, you know, THE
WALL STREET JOURNAL and, of course, the local paper.

@B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  But, uh, my, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to, to look at
the articles every day and, and go through a paper, you know, exhaust the
details.  So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines.

B.4:  Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail
information as you'd like?

A.5:  Well, yes.  I, I, well, I, I don't think I have the time to really become a
student in every article.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And, and so I, I, I like the weekly magazines, uh, because i-, it gives me,
you know, the high points of what's going on.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  Uh, but many times, uh, [sigh] you know, the, the local, uh, the local news
kind of suffers, you know.  But here I am, you know, cheek by jowl with our
nation's capital #[laughter] and,#

B.10:  #[Laughter] Oh,# that's right.  You're very close actually.  #It's# --

A.11:  #Yeah.#

B.12:  -- almost a, uh, bedroom community #for# --

A.13:  #Yes.#  

B.14:  -- the capital.  

A.15:  E-, exactly.  Well, when, when the capital gang always talk about the
people inside the beltway, I'm saying to myself, hey guys, I'm inside the
beltway #[laughter].#

B.16:  #[Laughter].#

A.17:  But, uh, i-, it turns out that, uh, that, that the C N N is, I think, is
great.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And for, for things like hurricanes and fast breaking events but generally,
they're, they're, they're more sound bitish, you know, kind of thing and, and
I don't really,

B.20:  [Clinking].

A.21:  uh, you know, I don't really feel as though I've a gotten sufficient, uh,
you know, dose of news that way.

B.22:  Yeah.  A lot of my information comes from several sources.  Probably pretty
high up on the list is National Public Radio.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  Uh, which I like.  

A.25:  Yes.

B.26:  Uh, I, I think it's fairly objective and I always like the letters that
they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative.
And while there's an inherent, uh, filtering process going on just by the
letters they choose to read, uh, I always figure it's a good thing when any
given group is being accused by each side of, uh, favoring the other side.
That's, that's potential indication of balance.  And, generally, I really do
believe they are pretty balanced.  Uh, I also read TIME magazine and we get
one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections
of the, uh, various, uh, of the articles and the front section and, uh,

A.27:  Well the MERCURY and the, and the, and the CHRONICLE are the only things
that are really, #can# --

B.28:  #Oh.#

A.29:  -- stand up there.

B.30:  Oh, you st-, [laughter] did you use to live around here?

A.31:  Uh, Redwood City.  #I use to work at Anteks.#

B.32:  #Oh, okay.#  Oh, yeah, okay.  #I know exactly where that is.#

A.33:  #Anteks, Amdahl# and places like that.

B.34:  Yeah, we, we get the MERCURY which I generally think is actually a pretty
good newspaper [clink].

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  A-, the newspaper I really been impressed with it when I've read it at
times, i-, at, well the LOS ANGELES TIMES.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  Which I've found to be a, uh [clinking] a very good quality [clinking], uh,
newspaper and I like a lot of the articles there.  Th-, the other thing when
you said, we don't have cable T V, so but the other thing that you referred to
that always sounds really interesting to me is, is called C SPAN.

A.39:  Yes.  I, I've, I enjoy, see they have, uh, we have two, the, both C SPANS
here.  But, #but# --

B.40:  #Both?#

A.41:  -- really, the, th-, on the public T V, you know, MACNEIL LEHRER --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- is one, is an hour's program that I always, if, if I watch any news
program, it will be MACNEIL LEHRER.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  And, and occasionally C SPAN.  I, I like a, I saw the, uh, the, uh, the,
the tapes that were, that were run of Marion Berry's drug bust was, the whole
thing was, was run on that #and# --

B.46:  #[Lipsmack] Oh, I# never say that.  That would #have been interesting.#

A.47:  -- #and, and a-, also,# they have the, uh, the, uh, uh, PARLIAMENT'S
QUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD.  #It,# 

B.48:  #Yeah.# I, I think that's always fascinating.  #I wish, I wish we had
something.#

A.49:  #when, wh-, when it first,# uh, you know, when it first tuned in on that I,
you know, it's one that's, [whistling] I think it was, somebody was just
((scarcely)) just, just ripping the hell out of #someo-, another person.#

B.50:  #[Snorting].#

A.51:  And I, and everybody was, you know, making noise in the background.  And
then,

B.52:  But it's usually the Prime Minister, right?

A.53:  Yeah.  Here's this #dude in a wig# --

B.54:  #Thatcher, ((Major)).#

A.55:  -- and I said to myself, it's another Monty Python that #I didn't know
about [laughter].#

B.56:  #[Laughter].#

A.57:  And then, and then up jumps Margaret Thatcher off her green bench and I
said oh, it's Parliament [laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter] Which could be another (( )) of Monty Python.

A.59:  Yeah.  So I, I thought to myself, I can't wait.  I'm going over to, to
Britain in mid, you know, in mid-May.  I, I, I'm going to, uh, you know, a-,
you know, apr-, approach my, uh, you know, this is how I discovered, you know,
the que-, the Prime Minister's, you know, question and answer period, you
know.  P-, 

B.60:  I, I have seen that and, uh, a, aside from the level of wit which is much
higher than, generally, in American politics, uh, which I really enjoy.  I
really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard, real questions I
think.  And it's unlike the fairly controlled, uh, press conferences that
Presidents of the United States have here where they, they always seem, 

A.61:  Yeah.
