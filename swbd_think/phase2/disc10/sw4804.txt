===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, well, do you use a budget?

@B.2:  Uh, I do at times.  Off and on.  Right now, I'm probably in one of the
more, the more off times.

A.3:  Any particular reason, uh, that you get off of it or does it seem to work
for you?

B.4:  Oh, it works fine.  It's just I, I think sometimes I, you know, you get
busy.  You slack off a little bit and then, you know, there's no more, uh, I
mean, then it's work to catch up.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Uh, you know, then the two or three times where I've got to the point I
really needed one, I created one and stuck by it.

A.7:  And you do stick by it when you do it, huh?  [Laughter].

B.8:  Yes.  How about you?

A.9:  Well, I tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is, I list all
my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over, I spend.

B.10:  Huh.

A.11:  You know, I just [laughter], that just kind of seems to be the way it
works.

B.12:  The budget I stuck on the most --

A.13:  Pardon me?

B.14:  -- the budget I was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy
budget.

A.15:  And?

B.16:  And, basically, ten percent of your income goes to, uh, uh, long-term
savings.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Twenty percent goes toward, uh, basically, short-term, you know, doing,
going out to dinner.  Like going to the movies, uh, maybe, you know, saving
that part up toward going on, you know, something a little more short-term,
than like the long-term budget.  And then the oth-, and then seventy percent
goes toward, uh, uh, you know, paying debts and, and that kind of stuff with
the whole idea being that you pay yourself first, you're more likely to stick
with it.

A.19:  Yes.  And I know that theory.  Unfortunately, neither, I'm mar-, married
and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in
the world.

B.20:  Huh.

A.21:  And, uh, so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at
times, you know.  Instead of thinking oh, we'll save it this month, we'll
think well, oh, gee, we'll buy this lamp or this whatever, you know.

B.22:  Sure.

A.23:  So, uh, our, our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain.  But, are you
married?

B.24:  Uh, I will be a week from next Monday.

A.25:  Oh, do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in
any way?

B.26:  No, not really.

A.27:  Have you kind of discussed this already with your fiance?  

B.28:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So far, for now, I think.  Uh, for now we've still got our
own money.  Really.  Uh, and that will probably, it'll probably be that way
until, uh, you know, we like buy our own house together or something.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  In which case, you know, it's very convenient to once again throw
everything together.  Uh,

A.31:  Well, I agree.  It's, uh, maybe for us, anyway, it's easier just to put it
all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who, you know, who
#donates# --

B.32:  #Right.#

A.33:  -- what to it.  

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  But, uh, but we just kind of started out that way #and,# 

B.36:  #Yeah.#  And right now, in my case, it's more situation that, uh, that she
uh, uh, has still got a lot of debt.

A.37:  Oh.

B.38:  And it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder the normal stuff --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt.

A.41:  Well, that's a good idea.  Do you think this is true of all women?  I seem
to have been in debt,

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  when my husband and I got married too [laughter].

B.44:  Well, I was the year before.  And that was the last time I really got on a
budget was to really fight being in debt because I didn't like it.

A.45:  Uh, no, it's not a whole lot of fun.  

B.46:  So [laughter] I think it's people in general.  

A.47:  [Inhaling].

B.48:  Yeah, you have a ten-, that's a tendency to do it when you can.  Uh, one of
the ways I insure my long-term savings is the fact that, you know, I've got a
Four Oh One K plan so I've got, uh, five percent of my income going into that.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  Uh, that's actually five percent before taxes.  

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  Uh, that, you know, so that's even more.  And then I've also, uh, uh, you
know, got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions.

A.53:  Which I think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the
money in your hand in the check, you'll think, oh well I just won't put
anything #or# --

B.54:  #(( )).#

A.55:  -- you know, even if it's, of course most of us are direct deposit anymore
anyway, I'm sure.  But once it goes into the checking account, it's awfully
hard to transfer it over.

B.56:  Right.  Well I've, I've even got a, uh, fifty dollar a month uh, uh, mutual
fund.  Automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month.

A.57:  That's a good idea.

B.58:  You know, once again, you know, you know it's there,

A.59:  [Beep].

B.60:  you know it's going to happen.  It's a, uh, an easier way to, uh, to save.

A.61:  [Noise] {sounds like a burp} Uh-huh.  And, uh, your fiance is, she'll, she
goes along with the savings part too even though, uh, she's managed to get
herself in debt?

B.62:  No, she has no ((say)) #[laughter].#

A.63:  #[Laughter]#  But you're going to manage to make her stick to your plan
right?  #[Laughter].#

B.64:  #Well sure.#  Like you said, right now we really kind of each have our own
money.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  Which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but I, I think until, you
know, we're, we're both growing (( )) because of that I think it's probably
stay (( )) for awhile.

A.67:  Well, actually, I know some people, a, a girlfriend of mine who was married
probably about three, three or four years ago and they still have separate
checking accounts.  That's the way they prefer it.  Uh, you know, she doesn't
go into detail as to #why# --

B.68:  #Right.#

A.69:  -- they prefer it that or anything, but it's, everybody, as long as I
think, uh, your,
