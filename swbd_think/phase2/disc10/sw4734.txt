==========================================================================

A.1:  My feelings on crime, being up here in Rochester, we're in western New
York, and really we don't have a hugh problem [inhaling] with, uh, crime as
much as say New York City --

@B.2:  Right.

A.3:  -- uh, by far, uh, although this year we did have fifty murders for the
year, sending, uh, the local press here into a tizzy over what the mayor was
going to do about all this stuff.

B.4:  Well now, that's not so far this year is it?  Or is that,

A.5:  No.  That was all of last year.

B.6:  Oh, I see.  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And the mayor kept saying, well, you know, what can you do, you know, it,
most of the murders that have taken place up here have been drug related.

B.8:  That's, I think that's the most of the murders anywhere, #I think.  Yeah.#

A.9:  #[Throat_clearing] Yeah, it,# it's getting a lot worse.  

B.10:  Well we, we have our share of, uh, murders down here.  Uh, I don't know, I,
I'm, I've been here for five years and I don't know.  This kind of things
don't hit national news very often but seems like down in Florida but seems
like down in Florida, there's a lot of strange crimes and murders that happen.

A.11:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.12:  I mean really off the wall stuff.  Uh, just a couple of weeks ago, these
people rented a house and the pool in the backyard of this house was kind of
like a pond.  It was all green, a-, you know, algae grown over it.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  [Swallowing] And so they were cleaning it up and the guy hit something.  He
couldn't see what it was #and so# --

A.15:  #Ooh.#

B.16:  -- he dragged it up into the shallow end and it was a garbage can and
inside the garbage can was a body.

A.17:  Huh! [laughter].  God!

B.18:  [Sigh] And, uh, you know, 

A.19:  [Throat_clearing].

B.20:  I think that stuff happens everywhere but it just seems like when I lived
in Illinois, I never saw as much of that kind of thing as I see down here in
Florida and I don't know why it is.  Maybe I just don't remember it,

A.21:  [Throat_clearing].

B.22:  or m-, or maybe the media in Illinois didn't, uh, expose it the way the
media does down here.

A.23:  Well we had up here, uh, a serial killer named Art Shawcross who, uh, uh,
did in, I think, twenty-one prostitutes over a, I think, a one and a half
year, one year and a half period and, uh, the name, his name went kind of
national because when everyone was sitting around wondering whether Mario was
going to run, is he going to run, is he going to run --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- well the Republicans were up here, uh, scrounging around because they
wanted to do, instead of a Willie Horton on him, they were going to do an Art
Shawcross because apparently this guy had, was released on a furlough program
when he was in Watertown in jail and, uh, under Cuomo's watch, the man was
released and then he went on to kill nineteen prostitutes here locally.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  We sit in on the trial one day watching it and oh, [laughter] that's an
experience I'll tell you [laughter].

B.28:  I bet.

A.29:  They have metal detectors here and all that in the county courts 
#because,# 

B.30:  #Yeah,# they, they have it here also.  

A.31:  Yeah, you're in, you're in, see most of the time when you think Florida,
the most, biggest crime that I can think about, that I hear about all the
time, is D W I down there.

B.32:  [Inhaling] No, actually, uh, the University of Florida in, uh, Gainesville
which is about two or three hours from where I live, there's been, uh, there's
been serial killers there for the last two, two to three years and, uh,
they'll go through one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight girls.  They
caught one guy and then no sooner had they caught him and, and convicted him,
a few months later there was another serial killer killing these college age
girls that are living on the campus down there.  #Or,# 

A.33:  #Yeah,# I remember seeing that on the #news.  I,# 

B.34:  #And so,# we have a lot of serial killers.  It's a, [laughter] there's a
lot more, it seems like, here than, when I lived in Illinois, there was the
one guy in Chicago that had buried some thirty odd boys.  He was a homosexual
and, uh, he had buried a lot of young boys, teenage boys on his property.  You
know, he had raped them and killed them and buried them.

A.35:  Yeah.  #I remember# --

B.36:  #[Swallowing] And some,# 

A.37:  -- hearing that too [throat_clearing].

B.38:  Yeah, like ten or twelve years ago this was, this happened, right.

A.39:  We're lucky enough that we don't have to put up with the New York City
shenanigans but,

B.40:  Oh, I bet that's just a madhouse.  I can't #imagine.# 

A.41:  #It's,# I would never live there in a million years with all the crime that
goes on.  Anytime anyone visits there, they always come back, at least one in
the group has been, at least, mugged once.

B.42:  That's incredible.  Yeah.  #Uh,# 

A.43:  #I'm#, where we are here, uh, I, you know, the biggest crimes seem to be,
you know, theft and drug related stuff lately, #uh# --

B.44:  #Yeah.#

A.45:  -- in the inner city section #of Rochester# --

B.46:  #Right.#

A.47:  -- because of the poverty level.  But, uh, you know, violent crime, in, in
the suburb that I'm in, Brighton, uh, I, we had one notorious crime.  It was
this axe murder and it's, you know, in the local community it's local lore now
because we all knew the husband [laughter] did it but they never found enough
evidence to convict the guy.

B.48:  I tell you.  There's just more and more of it, as, as every year it
progresses.  I mean, [laughter] the world's getting worse [laughter], you
know.  I think, uh, just, uh, not very long ago I read a piece in the paper.
There was a, a guy and his girlfriend were at a friend's house.  It was, it
was the guy and the boyfriend of the girl that had a,
