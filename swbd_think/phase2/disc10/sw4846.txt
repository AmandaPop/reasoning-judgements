===========================================================================

A.1:  [Clicking] Uh, basically, what do you do to get your news?

@B.2:  Well, most of my reading tends to be professional reading so, uh, scanning
headlines in the paper or reading over my wife's shoulder tends to be about
the only newspaper stuff I do.  Uh, and the newspaper is pretty much the local
news anyway.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, when it comes to national or statewide things, uh, I keep, uh, the
National Public Radio station, uh, that's available here,

A.5:  [Noise].

B.6:  uh, on all day and, uh, that's pretty much where I get my, uh, both,

A.7:  [Noise].

B.8:  uh, statewide and, and national news coverage together with a little bit of
T V news in the, uh, in the evenings.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  But primarily from, from radio.  Uh, which is, you know, that's a dosage of
about, uh, about two, two and a half hours of news a day.

A.11:  Depending on how long it takes you to get to work #[laughter].#

B.12:  #Well I,# it's on in my office #and I can# --

A.13:  #Oh, okay.#

B.14:  -- I can hear it as I'm working when I'm here.  My commute is, is about
fifteen minutes.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Uh, so I, I, you know, that's not an issue.  But that's primarily, you
know, where I end up getting it from.  And, and that, for me, is as much a, a,
a choice because I find it to be a good way to do it as it is a response to
limited time for doing reading and stuff.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  It's probably more because I just enjoy the coverage than it is because I
don't have time to read the paper --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- you know.

A.21:  Well, do you find that they, uh, tend to, after a certain period of time,
broadcast the same thing over and over?

B.22:  Well, they do to some extent.  I, I hear some, some repeats between, uh,
uh, THE MORNING EDITION and the ALL THINGS CONSIDERED in the afternoon.  Uh,
I, we do also have a re-, an intentionally repeated coverage.  They start at
five thirty in the morning and, uh, uh, they play the first, you know, hour
again over at the tail end of the broadcast #so that# --

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  -- people who aren't up that early still get to hear it.  So some of it is
intentionally repeated and, and so once in a while I hear the same story twice
or in the afternoon I'll hear the same report from the same correspondent in
Yugoslavia, uh, that they played in the morning.  #So there# --

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#

B.26:  -- is to some extent, some repetition, uh, like that, you know.  But, uh,
for me it's better than trying to read, uh, TIME or NEWSWEEK or, or U S NEWS
each week.  I tried that once.  And, uh, if I have something to read, I feel
obligated to read it.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And, uh, then I felt guilty because I never had time to read everything
that was in them.

A.29:  And so you threw the magazines away and wasted your money and #[laughter].#

B.30:  #Yeah, that was, that was about# it, you know.  Uh, so now I'm saving trees
and, and #uh, by by not,#

A.31:  #[Laughter].#

B.32:  pub-, subscribing to the magazines anymore.  But, uh, uh, well how do you
do it?

A.33:  Well, basically, I get, I listen to A B C in the morning, uh, on the GOOD
MORNING AMERICA a-, while I'm getting ready for work.  And other than that,
occasionally, uh, I'll catch some news when I come home.  My husband's a big
news fan and he'll always have the news on but sometimes I'll get involved
doing some other things.  And, uh, newspapers, maybe on the weekend but during
the week I just really don't have the time in the morning to get it.  Uh, and
I'll listen to news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from
work in between music.

B.34:  ((You)) see, here we're in, in mountain standard time and, uh, w-, the few
times when I've run into shows like GOOD MORNING AMERICA, uh, they've really
been at the wrong time for me.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  They seem to start very late for us and I've got to be at work, you know,
I'm leaving the house at like seven fifteen,

A.37:  [Noise].

B.38:  and so, uh, uh, th-, some of them t-, t-, t-, seem to be, you know, like
they don't come on until seven or something and, and, so there's not enough
time e-, uh, to, to watch it.  But they have so many other things that are
thrown in that, you know, I really don't care about, you know, how to make
baked potatoes #or, or whatever.#

A.39:  #[Laughter].#

B.40:  Uh, or, or, or weather men with funny ha-, [talking] uh, wigs, you know.

A.41:  [Laughter] That's ((another)) channel #[laughter].#

B.42:  #Yo-, well, yeah, but, th-, they,# all the morning ones have a tendency to
do a little bit of that.

A.43:  Well, this is true.  They #want# --  

B.44:  #And,# 

A.45:  -- to put a little humor in there.

B.46:  ((all right,)) you know, it's mostly just the timing.  They seem to be on
so late in the morning that I, I started wondering myself, you know, so who is
it that watches these things.  But I think it's because of our particular time
zone, uh, it, we don't go on daylight savings time and so everything is
shifted by an hour.  That may have been when I, you know, I looked in on it,
uh what time.  It, it just, uh, you know, for me a lot of what I look for in
news is as much analysis kinds of things --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- or, uh, sometimes human interest kinds of things that are a reflection
of the news rather than just here's the events that happened.  Uh, I'm a real
history nut and so,
