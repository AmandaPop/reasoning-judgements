==========================================================================

A.1:  [Clicking] [talking].

B.2:  So, what sort of car are you interested in getting next?

@A.3:  Well, actually, I love the car I have.  I have a Chrysler LeBaron
convertible.  #And# --

B.4:  #Ah.#

A.5:  -- I love it.  And I would get another one in a minute.  Unless I could
afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little
Corvette or something like that.  And that's what would influence my decision
to change because I like a really sporty car.  And I'd love an expensive one
#but I probably,#

B.6:  #[Laughter].#

A.7:  can never afford it so [laughter].

B.8:  Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy
driving performance automobiles.  Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five
liter Mustang G T --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and
perform better,

A.11:  [Noise].

B.12:  and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,
the best car I could get regardless of money, [inhaling] uh, I probably would
be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Well, I'm a nurse here and we have a doctor at this
hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.

B.14:  A, a three twenty-eight G T S?

A.15:  And I couldn't tell you but it's just beautiful.  And I go out and I love
to #touch it but I can't even do that because [laughter] of the alarm.#

B.16:  #[Laughter]#  #You just go hunting?#

A.17:  #So, I just look# at it a lot #[laughter].#   

B.18:  #Go out and# lust after it.

A.19:  Really [laughter].  Exactly.  But it sure is a pretty thing [laughter].

B.20:  So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?  

A.21:  No.  I'm working on it [laughter].  No, I really haven't, no, huh-uh
[talking].  #I did# --

B.22:  #(( )).#

A.23:  -- test drive a Corvette last year.  Maybe the year before.  It was brand
new, white, it was like a big marshmallow.  When you sat in the seats, they
adjusted to fit around you.

B.24:  uh.

A.25:  I mean they came in and up and out and I mean, they did whatever and, and
we went for a test drive in that and I was able to open that up pretty good
and that was really fun.  And I wanted it, but I had a choice of that or my
house and #I thought that I'd continue,#

B.26:  #[Laughter].#

A.27:  to live in my house [laughter] so.

B.28:  Yeah, there, there's something about having a place to live, #I don't
know.#

A.29:  #Yeah,# you know, it's just necessary.  And I did, I thought well a tent
wouldn't be bad but probably not practical.

B.30:  Could sleep in the back of the 'vette.  

A.31:  Yeah, right [laughter].  So,

B.32:  I find that, uh, that the Corvettes are, are becoming really, really nice
cars.

A.33:  They are, they're pretty aren't they lately [noise].  

B.34:  Yeah.  #And# --

A.35:  #They really# are.

B.36:  -- they, they've improved,

A.37:  [Baby_crying].

B.38:  the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun
to drive.

A.39:  Really.

B.40:  It's not like driving a, a Winnebago or something.

A.41:  Oh, no [laughter].  No, no.  See, I'm not into station wagons and vans and
things that people are really buying now and [noise] they go isn't that a nice
van and I go, um.

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  [Laughter] Not really, you know.  #How about# --

B.44:  #Nice.#

A.45:  -- a Greyhound bus [laughter].

B.46:  Yeah.  Nice isn't the word I'd choose.  Maybe practical.

A.47:  Yeah.  #I mean that, you know.#

B.48:  #Isn't that a practical van.#

A.49:  There's some that are prettier than others and yeah, the new type is
prettier than what their, they used to look like but I sure don't think it's
attractive, you know.  It's not like, like driving a little sports car.

B.50:  Yeah.  It, it's very hard to find something practical that's also
attractive.

A.51:  Yeah.  I don't think that happens so, but I, I love mine, so, and I, I
bought it because I drove a friend's in Hawaii and I just went home and I
walked in and I picked it out and he said take it home and bring it back if
you want to, and I never did.  I just went back and signed the papers
[laughter] and I knew nothing about my car when I got it.  Nothing.  I didn't
know how anything worked.

B.52:  Well, so it was a completely new experience for you.  And I'm sure you
enjoyed every minute of it.

A.53:  Yeah.  And I've had it, it's almost three years actually.  And I've, I
still love it.  I put the top down everywhere I go.  I timed it when I first
got it and it took twenty min-, I mean twenty seconds and so, I figured there
was nowhere I was to late to go that I didn't have twenty more seconds.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  So.

B.56:  And, and you couldn't get, how long does it take to go back up?  About the
#same time.#

A.57:  #Twenty seconds,# yeah.  That's all it takes.  I mean, it's just a button,
that's #it.  You# --

B.58:  #Yeah, so [noise].#

A.59:  -- release it right [noise] at the top, so #you don't have to# --

B.60:  #So you won't get,# 

A.61:  -- get out or anything.  

B.62:  Yeah and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too
substantial.

A.63:  Well I did, actually.  Last week going to the airport, I just hit a
downpour and I was on a highway going like eighty.

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  So I really did.  I mean [laughter] I was soaking wet.  I thought I would
drown [laughter] in the seconds that it took me to pull over [laughter].

B.66:  Whoops.

A.67:  But it all dried out, you know.  #Didn't# --

B.68:  #Yeah.#

A.69:  -- take long when the sun came out but [laughter] [sniffing] it was kind of
funny.  I'm sure people around me really enjoyed it #[laughter] but,# 

@@B.70:  #[Laughter]# Oh.  No I was just down in Austin last week and the weather
was pretty nice too.  So,

A.71:  Oh and wasn't it pretty last week with the #Bluebonnets and everything,
yeah, yeah.#

B.72:  #With the Bluebonnets out, yeah.  It# really was.  Yeah I decided that
Austin is certainly someplace that I could handle living.

A.73:  [Noise] {someone is walking} Yeah.  A lot of people say that and it's
pretty far from where I live [/talking].
