B.1:  kids too?

A.2:  Yeah [laughter].  #(( )).#

B.3:  #Oh, you laugh.#  How many, what ages?  [laughter].

A.4:  Well, twenty-seven up.

B.5:  Uh.

A.6:  And we had five.

B.7:  You've been through the fun part [laughter].

A.8:  Oh, yeah.

B.9:  [Laughter].

A.10:  And how about yourself?

B.11:  I have a four and a half and a three.

A.12:  Oh. #well.#

B.13:  #So.# It's, I, I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way, in the way
it's done now and then.

A.14:  Yeah.  Well, when mine were growing up, I did some traveling and but not
that extensively but I always (( )) just made it a point, you know, to spend
about ten minutes with each one of them.

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  So it was an hour, #you know.#

B.17:  #Yeah.#

A.18:  But whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting
the breeze or whatever, telling them stories or reading to them.

B.19:  What was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest?

A.20:  [Laughter] Six years.

B.21:  So they were all real close?  

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  That's tough.  That's a lot of #time.#

A.24:  #Oh, yeah.#  We look back and wonder how we did it.

B.25:  Did you both work?  Your wife too?

A.26:  No, she never did.

B.27:  Uh, well, #qualify that.#  

A.28:  #(( )).#

B.29:  She worked at home, I'm #sure [laughter].#

A.30:  #Well, yeah, yeah.#

B.31:  But that's, uh, well both my husband and I work and sometimes I feel like,
you know, by the time I pick them up and get them home and get them fed, I
have very little time each evening.

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  Maybe thirty minutes max.

A.34:  Well that's plenty #though.# 

B.35:  #And# well he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking and then I
spend time with them while, you know, he's doing other stuff.  And, and, of
course, we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend.  You know, there's a lot
of times my house may not be as clean as I particularly like it but it's neat,
it's straight and I can live with it #because# --

A.36:  #Yeah.#

B.37:  -- I do stuff with my kids, you know.  

A.38:  Right.  Well, you know, with kids you're not going to have a neat house.

B.39:  Well, I've accepted that too [laughter].

A.40:  [Laughter] #And, you know# --

B.41:  #That's true.#

A.42:  -- it, it's tough to find time.

B.43:  It is.

A.44:  E-, espec-, especially with both of them working.  

B.45:  Yeah.  That's true.

A.46:  And you just have to set the time and say, okay this is going to be it.

B.47:  Well, that's true and, and we do a lot of that on the weekends, you know.
We try to spend Saturdays together.

A.48:  Right.

B.49:  If my husband golfs, you know, he'll do it during nap time, things like
that where they're not really missing the presence, you know.

A.50:  Right.

B.51:  And, and we do a lot of family things together.  We're, we're kind of going
the other direction this weekend.  We're planning a trip, just he and I.  This
is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids --

A.52:  #Well that's good too.#

B.53:  -- #since she was born# four and a half years ago.

A.54:  Yeah, that's good that way too [laughter].

B.55:  Well, I decided that, you know, you need that once in awhile.  That you,
you need to plan the quality time and, and I do think that if you plan it and
spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty-four
hours a day.

A.56:  Yeah.  Well, that, they say it, it, all it takes is about five, ten minutes
a day.

B.57:  Yeah.

A.58:  And, you know, and as the kids got older I made them, you know, help me cut
the grass and --

B.59:  Sure.

A.60:  -- kind of made that a project too.

B.61:  Sure.

A.62:  Or whatever and,

B.63:  And they think that's a family activity, you know.

A.64:  Oh, yeah.

B.65:  Yeah.  That's great fun [laughter].  

A.66:  And, uh, well, yeah, if,

B.67:  My daughter's like, Mommy can I help you with the laundry?  Of course, you
can [laughter].

A.68:  [Laughter] Yeah.  #Just keep them talking that way.#

B.69:  #Absolutely.  Yeah [laughter].#

A.70:  But, uh, another thing we used to do is have ham-, family councils.

B.71:  Uh-huh.

A.72:  Every Sunday night.  

B.73:  And what would you do, what?

A.74:  [Cough] Discuss everything that didn't agree with them.  And we'd take
turns being president.

B.75:  Oh.

A.76:  And everyone would get one vote.  And I always thought we'd get outvoted
five to two --

B.77:  Yeah.

A.78:  -- but it never worked that way.  

B.79:  So they would just pick whatever issue #kind of was at a# --

A.80:  #Yeah. Well and we could bring up# --

B.81:  -- head that week and then,

A.82:  -- and we could bring up stuff too.

B.83:  Oh.

A.84:  And that was always good time.  Boy, we really got to know the kids well.

B.85:  I imagine.  And I imagine you still have a very close relationship with
them.

A.86:  Oh, yeah.  #In# --

B.87:  #I,# 

A.88:  -- fact, they were all in, uh, over the weekend for Easter.

B.89:  Oh, that's wonderful.  See I was raised in that type of family where, you
know, you don't disobey me, you mind me but if you have a problem with what we
did or how we did it, you can always come back and talk to me about it.

A.90:  Well, we did too.

B.91:  Yeah.  

A.92:  And I remember the one daughter saying, we had a, a friend of hers that
used to drive us up a tree --

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94: -- and she said, hey I don't make fun {mispronounced}, fun of your
friends so why make fun of mine?

B.95:  Uh #well.#

A.96:  #Kind of r-,# kind of hit us between the eyes.

B.97:  Yeah, yeah.  You don't think of it that way do you #[laughter].#

A.98:  #No.#  But that, that was always good quality time for us.

B.99:  Now that's good.  #I like# --

A.100:  #And then# --

B.101:  -- that idea.

A.102:  -- never attend, but if, if they missed it, they had to abide by the rules.

B.103:  Whatever was voted on, huh.

A.104:  Yeah and boy, they, they'd show up.

B.105:  Well I think that's great.

A.106:  And we'd usually take notes --

B.107:  Yeah.

A.108:  -- and, you know, the younger kids, uh, or maybe all of them needed help at
one time or another.

B.109:  Yeah.

A.110:  And, uh, but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us.
And they loved it.

B.111:  I, I think that's true.  I can remember times my parents would say well
what do you think would be a fair punishment.

A.112:  Yeah.

B.113:  And we would always come up with something that was harder than what they
would have done --

A.114:  Yeah.

B.115:  -- you know.  So I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves,
#you know.#

A.116:  #Yeah.#  But, uh, boy, I, I feel for you and #your husband.#

B.117:  #Oh,# why is that?

A.118:  Well, my, my, uh, two of my, uh,
