==========================================================================

A.1:  [Breathing] Okay.  Uh, I haven't been in this situation yet [laughter].
You know, my, my parents are not quite at that age yet, #so I haven't,# 

B.2:  #[TV] [talking] [child] They're not# quite elderly, huh [laughter].

A.3:  No.  So I haven't, uh, really been in that situation although they are
thinking about my grandmother but, uh --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- [Children] but that's really about it.  How about you?  Have you been in
that situation yet?

B.6:  Uh, not for my parents.  But I, I was around, uh, two sets of grandparents,
uh, quite a bit,

A.7:  [Noise] {sounds like kitchen noises like water and pots and pans} [static].

B.8:  we, we put one, I put one grandfather in a rest home --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and that killed him [laughter].

A.11:  Did it really?

B.12:  Well, yeah, kind of.  Well, there was some other things involved but it,
before he was really active and the, there was some, you know, he lost his
drivers license and ((I)) couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some
things and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  And he just kind of became a vegetable and died.

A.15:  Oh, no.

B.16:  #So# --

A.17:  #That's# sad.

B.18:  -- but that was a long time ago.  

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  That was, uh, back in like seventy-three.

A.21:  Oh, #okay.#

B.22:  #So,# uh, I think the way they did things were a lot different back then.

A.23:  I'm sure they were.  #Yeah.#

B.24:  #And,# uh, my grandmother, his, his wife --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- uh, we also put her in a rest home.  She was in a rest home and then she
was back out because she didn't really need to be there [noise] and, uh, had a
physical, had a good physical therapist at that place #and# --

A.27:  #Ah.#

B.28:  -- they worked with her and got her walking and got her ta-, kind of taking
care of herself and #so# --

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  -- she was able to come back home and --

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  -- then she had to go back in a couple of times, but mostly it was just
because she kind of gave up.

A.33:  Um.

B.34:  And they got her going again.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  So I guess as far as looking, I said as what you're looking for, I think
you need to look for an active, uh, an [talking] interactive staff.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  Somebody who is willing to work with, uh, you know, work with a patients
and do --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- do things with them and treat them, treat #like ((they're)),# 

A.41:  #And I'm sure# it's, it's expensive.  Yeah.

B.42:  It, it is [laughter].  

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  It is expensive.

A.45:  Yeah.  My, my grandmother is not in a nursing home but she's in a --

B.46:  [Noise] Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- [Lipsmack] oh they're like, uh, they're apartments for senior 
citizens --

B.48:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day 
long --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and then they have, uh, where the bus picks them up and takes them where
they need to go and she, she, she really does love that but she's just
concerned about i-, in the future, you know.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  That, she, she knows it's not going to be like that all the time.  #And
she's just wondering well# --

B.54:  #When she can't take care of herself.#

A.55:  -- what's going to happen to me and, and I, you know, it's, I guess it's so
normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that, but --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- you know --

B.58:  Now  [noise],

A.59:  -- she's kind of asking questions about what, well what's going to happen,
this can't last forever and so.

B.60:  Uh-huh.  Does she have a, is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she
can fix her own food if she wants to --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- or she can go down to the cafeteria?  

A.63:  Yeah, she can but I, I think it is also cafeteria style.  Because I, I
really, I, I, I doubt if she rarely cooks for herself.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  So, uh --

B.66:  ((In fact, I)),

A.67:  -- because I, I remember her, in her letters, telling me she'll go
downstairs for coffee or something to eat, so I'm assuming it's something like
that too.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  So.

B.70:  Yeah, I, I really like that concept.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  They've, they have a few of those, well quite a few of those places like
that here in Utah and, you know, couples can, you know, husband and wife can,
can live there too or, or whatever.  I, and, and then, and yet they have
their, their friendships and relationships and the, [coughing] {child in
background} you know, of getting together and eating together and all of that.

A.73:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.74:  I, I think it really takes, uh, you know, looking more at the people than
even really the facilities.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  And she lives by herself too.  She seems to like it.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  And, uh, my husband's grandmother is, well, she lives, she lives in a house
on her own and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but, she
has her own home and sh-, she's doing really well.  I'm really proud of her.
She's doing really well, so we haven't had to do anything, but then again, she
has a lot of support so --

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  -- I mean, she's got her mother in town too and things like that so.

B.80:  #Yes.#

A.81:  #Hopefully,# we won't need to go that route [door].

B.82:  Well, I, I think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary, you know,
a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's, it's almost like
that, you know, they say putting them out to pasture and some, some of the
people that were there with my grandmother were really active.

A.83:  Yeah [/children] [/noise] [/breathing].

B.84:  They, they wanted to do things.  They didn't, you know, they didn't want to
go down and play bingo or, uh, you know, play with the oranges [/TV]
[/talking] [/child],
