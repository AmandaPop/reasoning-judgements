============================================================================

A.1:  I kind of think the, probably the biggest political topic that I can think
of at this point, [inhaling] is probably the Ross Perot --

@B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- uh, candidacy.  Uh, I think that that has some interesting, uh, effects
to it at this point with the, uh, [inhaling] level of, uh, [swallowing] uh,
o-, outrage that the public seems to have, the voting public seems to have
with the existing candidates out there and I think that, uh, that is certainly
something that we haven't seen to this level before.

B.4:  Right.  Well they've been independent candidates but, uh, never as. a-, as
popular as he seems to be.  And I mean it seems to be, [cough] doesn't really
matter who, who it is.  It's just that fact that he's not in either party.
That, uh, seems to be why he's so popular I guess.

A.5:  [Throat_clearing] What's your view on big [rustling] political issues?  

B.6:  Huh.  Uh, well if we, I mean sticking with this topic, uh, I would just say
that, you know, it's, it's interesting that it doesn't really seem to matter
what, uh, what his views are, you know.  I mean he seems to have some views
which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Uh, but i-, it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that
he's an alternative, you know, than to, uh, to what, what, you know, i-, I
guess he hasn't really outlined a platform yet, you know.  And people keep
asking him, you know, what, what do you feel, uh, is a plan to deal with the
budget or blah, blah, blah.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  And, uh, he really doesn't have any answers, I guess.  But that doesn't
stop his popularity from swelling, you know.  People are just sick and tired
of,

A.11:  [Thumping].

B.12:  uh, everyone else I guess.  

A.13:  [Lipsmack].

B.14:  It seems to be, I don't know, it's kind of like, uh, 

A.15:  [Thumping].

B.16:  people always, people always blame, [barking] you know, they always say how
can, uh-oh, #[laughter],#

A.17:  #[Laughter].#

B.18:  [/Barking] dogs outside.  Uh, people always say how, how can these
politicians be in power and stuff but I guess they forget that they're the
ones who put them there in the first place, you know.  They're always, they're
always trying to find third, third alternatives like, uh, you know, limiting,
limiting number of years in office for instance.  But, you know, all they have
to do is vote him out of office, you know.  It's almost like they want to be
forced to vote the way that they could, in any case.  You know what I mean
[laughter]?

A.19:  Yeah [inhaling].

B.20:  It seems strange.

A.21:  [Throat_clearing] It, it's going to be interesting to see if he, uh,
actually, you know, we hear the complaints about, uh, voter apathy and, and
the whole, the whole shebang about throw the bums out.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  It, and it, usually, you know, it's a big deal until election day comes
around and then it, you know, it fizzles out and we end up with the same
people.

B.24:  Exactly.

A.25:  And, uh, you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that, uh,
is really going to result in a, a mass turnout of the current people that we
have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old,
well, throw the bums out but not my bum, you #know [snort].#

B.26:  #Right,# right.  As long as he brings pork back [laughter] my state
((then)).  Uh, what do you think his chances are?  What do you think, uh, how
much of the vote do you think he's going to get and do you think he will take
it more from the Republicans or the Democrats?

A.27:  Well, the media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the
Democrats but I know that there is a lot of Democrats that don't like Bill
Clinton.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  I'm one of them #[laughter].  I'm# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- not happy with Bill Clinton at all.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  Uh, but, I, you know, I'm c-, more concerned about Democrats saying they're
unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then
we, basically, split any protest vote a-, against Bush more or less in half,
you know.

B.34:  Exac-, 

A.35:  I mean, you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more
years and, you know --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- for me that's not a, going to be a wonderful, uh, feeling.

B.38:  Exactly.

A.39:  But, uh, [door] I think it will be interesting to see, uh, whether it turns
out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote, if that.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  Uh, I,

B.42:  Personally, I have a, I have a problem with, with electing someone who is
that rich [laughter].  Uh, I mean, they're all that rich anyway.  But, but

A.43:  [Squeak].

B.44:  someone who is advertised as that rich, I don't know.  I, I kind of, uh,
have problems seeing what he and I would have in common, you know.

A.45:  [Inhaling] Yeah, but I, you know.  It'll be interesting.  I, I don't, I
agree that I don't think that,
