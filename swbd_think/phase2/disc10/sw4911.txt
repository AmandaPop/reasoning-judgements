REMARKS:        There is a noise on A's side that sounds like she is playing
with his telephone receiver, maybe twisting it somehow.

=============================================================================

A.1:  Yeah.  Do you have a particular opinion on it?

B.2:  I'm a little, uh, I'm a, I, I think that, that I do.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  I, I'm not sure that, uh,

A.5:  [Noise].

B.6:  that I think it should be like a normal practice all the time.  I think
there are certain circumstances where it's important.  But it, it kind of
touches on, on, on privacy and so, you know, I have kind of a, a feeling that,
that it's a little invasive [swallowing].  But then, again, on the other hand,
you have to stop and realize that, uh, a lot of people are, are, uh, are, are
trapped in that, in that addiction thing, you know.  And it's bad for them.
But that's not necessarily going to mean that they're going to get the help
they need and, and get cured or anything, you know.  And some jobs, uh, uh,
require you to be straight and with it.  To do a good job and protect yourself
and things like that too, you know, so.  How you think?  How you feel?

A.7:  Well, well, I'm kind of ambivalent also.  Yo-, like you say, it, it does
affect your privacy.  Uh, I guess I, how I could cope with it.  I do think, in
some cases, it does make sense and how I could cope with it was, uh, if, when
you accepted a job they told you up front this is part of it, you know, then
it was like porn movies.  You have the choice, you know, #nobody# --

B.8:  #Right.#

A.9:  -- sticks it in your face.  You've got the choice.  If you don't want to
deal with it, don't take the job.

B.10:  There you go.  That's #right.#

A.11:  #Uh,# there are certain jobs in which I would be more likely to feel
comfortable about it and, and those are the jobs in which a person's
performance could affect your life.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Certainly, uh, someone who carries a gun.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Uh, there's been a lot of publicity, uh, in New York, on Long Island,
where, uh, there's been school bus drivers who have driven erratically and
caused accidents and killed kids because #they# --

B.16:  #Wow.#

A.17:  -- were, uh, on drugs and things.  

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  And where your actions could affect somebody's life, I'd be much more
accepting of drug testing.  But under no circumstances would I think that you
could just go take a job and they could say, hey, guess what, you know, we're
going to do [laughter] this.

B.20:  #Right.#

A.21:  #I,# I think it has to be up front.  And then you've got the choice of not
doing it.

B.22:  Yeah.  Well, well the problem there is that, you know, a lot of people that
have worked for the same company for so long, uh, that company decides well,
if we're going to hire new people, you know, well we're going to have to start
checking it because we've had a problem in the past.  Well their problem in
the past is with past employees and so the new people are saying well, [sigh]
if, you know, I mean I'm sure this could happen, you know.  If you're going
to, if you're going to, uh, test us, you should be testing the old people too.
And so they get into a, to a discrimination problem probably #or something
like that.#

A.23:  #Well, yeah.  I# imagine it would be just this is new company policy and
we're doing it to everybody [laughter].

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  In which case, hey, you know, you don't like it, you can go look for
another job.  But, of course, that's not so easy.  You know [/noise].  Uh,

B.26:  [Breathing] See, there's one of the big problems.  People are, are in that
situation.  They need that job.  #Uh# --

A.27:  #Right.#

B.28:  -- and, uh, then they have the choice of either take the test or don't get
the, or, or don't take the job.  And if they know they're going to fail the
test, you know, [laughter] they're kind of in, in, uh, between a rock and a
hard place there.  #So, it's, uh, kind of a bad situation {very, very faint}.#

A.29:  #(( )).  I took a,# I'm, I'm a licensed art teacher and I substitute.
Which is why I'm home today [laughter].  #I'm not wor-,#

B.30:  #Oh, really.#

A.31:  I'm not working [laughter].

B.32:  Lucky you.

A.33:  Well, you know, I'm home a little too often I think [laughter].  They,
they're not calling substitutes that often.  But, at any rate, uh, I had taken
a state test to be, of all things, a court officer [rustling].

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Uh, my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant
idea.  So I just went along with it.  I thought it would be neat, you know.
Like a James Bond woman with a gun and all this.  And part of the, uh, you
know, you take this test.  I did very well.  And they called me in for a
physical.  And part of it was a test for drugs.  Nobody asked me, you know.
They didn't mention what they were doing.  But it was perfectly obvious and I,
you know, all government people and all army people are just tested.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  And there was one fellow who just kept horsing around.  He, he seemed
almost, you know, a little crazy.  But he wouldn't, you know, give a urine
sample and it was pretty obvious [laughter] why, you know.  #He'd just say oh,
I can't do it, I can't do it, you know [laughter].#

B.38:  #He was going to fail [laughter].#

A.39:  And this went on for hours.  I was wondering why he didn't just leave, you
know.  If you're not going to do it, just leave #[laughter].#

B.40:  #Right.  Because# you're not going to get the #job if you don't.#

A.41:  #It was, it# was almost comical.  Uh, in my case, they didn't follow me in
the bathroom, but apparently they were following, you know, the more
suspicious types into the bathroom.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  You know.  Cause apparently people, I read somewhere that you can replace
your urine with Gin-, with warm Sprite or something [laughter].  Mountain Dew
[laughter].

B.44:  Huh?  [laughter].

A.45:  And it tests, you know, that it tests like urine and, you know, it #tests
okay obviously [laughter].#

B.46:  #I don't know.#  I've heard people using somebody elses.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.48:  #You know.#

A.49:  You know.  I mean, I guess if there, #I guess there# --

B.50:  #Smuggle it in.#

A.51:  -- is something to be worried about if there's a whole science of knowing
how to deal with the test [laughter].  Uh,

B.52:  [Swallowing] Making a whole new element of society out there.

A.53:  Yeah [laughter].  #(( )).#

B.54:  #[Swallowing] I don't# know.  You know, uh, like I don't, uh, I don't use
drugs, you know, but, uh, I know people who do.  I don't think,
