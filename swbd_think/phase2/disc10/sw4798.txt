===========================================================================

A.1:  [TV] Anyway, I guess there was just somebody recently down there wasn-,
today in Texas was it or #there was, uh, put to death.#

B.2:  #[Breathing] I'm not,# uh, I'm not sure.  There was the big one, uh,
earlier in the week in, uh, #California that# --

A.3:  #California, yeah.#

B.4:  -- on and off and on and off.  

A.5:  Yeah.  So how do you feel about it?  [Child].  

B.6:  Uh,

A.7:  About capital punishment?

B.8:  I don't know.  I'm, I'm, uh, mixed views on it.  I, I don't think that it
really does much good as it, as a deterrent, uh --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- the old thing in, in terms of the, the, the, uh, biggest day for
pickpockets was at the, when they were hanging pickpockets but, in public.
But, uh, uh, on the other hand it, i-, t-, it seems like that th-, there just
aren't, are, uh, {pause} some crimes and, and some lives that, that, that
there's no other [laughter] #at# --

A.11:  #Yeah.#

B.12:  -- least emotional reaction to it.  What about you?

A.13:  Well I've, you know, I, I, kind of like you, there's certain crimes that I
think it fits.  I'm for it, generally speaking.  I think the thing that bugs
me the most about it is that the process itself gets so drug out and so, you
know, I understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the
guilt and whatnot, but the appeal process of it, I think, is what really bugs
me.  If you're going to make it go so long, you know, what's the use of it.

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  It almost becomes more, more co-, you know, to much cost and more trouble
than it's worth, #you know# --

B.16:  #Yeah.#

A.17:  -- to, to put somebody like that to death or something that, you know,
rather than just sentence him to life [child] and forget all the hassle.  You
don't have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot [child].

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  Because I feel like, #you know# --

B.20:  #Yeah.#

A.21:  -- sometimes it gets to drug out but --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- I am, I am, basically, for it with, if, you know, if the crime, of
course, fits it because --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- some of those people jus-, you got to wonder will they ever do anything.
#I mean,# 

B.26:  #Right,# right.  That, that there's just,

A.27:  The time just comes that, pure and simple, you know.  You got to wonder if
they're just a plain and simple menace to society or #they# --

B.28:  #Right,# right.

A.29:  -- going to ever reform --

B.30:  Right.

A.31:  -- but [child], 

B.32:  Well now does, uh, uh, Utah have capital punishment?

A.33:  Yes, we do, uh-huh.  And they, and it's been a, there was a, oh it's been
about fourteen years now, there was a pretty hideous murder [noise] in a hi-fi
shop where they murdered one person and they, they, the two people that did
it, they poured Draino down one guy's throat and they kicked a pin through
another guy's ear and --

B.34:  Huh.

A.35:  -- all kinds of things like that and, and, of cor-, a couple have ended up
dying and a couple didn't but, uh --

B.36:  Huh.

A.37:  -- one of the ki-, one of the two men involved was, uh, was, was, uh, put
to death oh about two years ago.  And, like I said, if, it took about thirteen
years for it to happen.  And the other guy is still sitting on death row here
thirteen, fourteen years later.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  And that's why, you know, like I say, a part of my thing with the whole
appeal process kind of bugs me cause here they have sat for, you know, fifteen
years and I, I wonder about the families of the people who are the victims,
you know, and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves #and,#

B.40:  #Yeah,# tha-, tha-, that's it, you know, that, that [sigh], if it's going
to happen it seems like the-, there is some sort of closure when --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- it, when it's over and done with.  I know that was one of the aspects
that covered the sequel to the case in California was, was both this is the
first one in twenty-five years and they've got something like over three
hundred --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- (( )) on death row.  But the other thing was whe-, you know, the family
of the victims.  Uh, one of the fathers of the boys, I think in California,
wanted to be there to, to witness it and they didn't feel like the whole
thing was over and that's been fourteen years too, I think.

A.45:  Yeah.  #That's true.#

B.46:  #And, uh,# 

A.47:  Yeah, they, uh, [child] uh, oh I for-, I lost my point, but, that's, like I
say, I think the victims and jus-, if that's going to happen they, they just
want to have it done and over with.  But, you know, I agree there's got to be
some appeal process because it's almost, y-, you want to make sure in that
situation that the person really did commit the crime.  Uh, you --

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  -- want to give him every opportunity you possible can but, uh [noise]
[child],

B.50:  Well, that's then, that's the thing here in, (( )) here in Texas.  We've
had a couple of cases in the last, one, one was, was a murder case where it
was --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- at this point it was fairly obvious that it was a, a girl was killed at
a high school and it was pretty obvious that the police just picked out the
black janitor and --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and, uh, set him up for it and, uh, he really didn't have anything to do
with it.  And they --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- [Laughter] that certainly makes you think #a, again and,# 

A.57:  #Yeah, that's, that's# [child] the scary part, especially something like
this.

B.58:  Yeah, and, uh,

A.59:  I know in, uh, you know, this California case the, uh, the Civil Lib-, or A
C L U, I guess, the American Civil --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- Liberties, you know, they were doing anything they could to prevent it.
Even to going as far as, uh, you know, stating that the gas chamber is not,
uh, as cruel, or is cruel and unusual punishment and (( )) they just drag up
any little thing they possible can to drag it out --

B.62:  Yeah.

A.63:  -- or whatnot, you know.  I mean,

B.64:  Well now, in, uh, in Utah what's the method?  I-, --

A.65:  They use the --

B.66:  -- is it firing squad #or what?#

A.67:  -- #firing# squad --

B.68:  Huh?

A.69:  -- is, is what's used.  A firing squad.  Yeah [/TV].

B.70:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Wasn't there a big case,
