REMARKS:        There is some light static all the way through but a strong
line noise or tone on B's side.  B also mumbles and stutters some.

============================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] Actually, I've been involved in electronics a long time.  Uh, in
computers and I have really resisted the impulse to [swallowing] get one for
the home.

B.2:  [Tone] [static] Oh yeah.

A.3:  Uh, up until, I guess, maybe about a year and a half ago, I got one for my
son.  A, a Macintosh --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- uh, L C.  It's a real easy to use color, uh, computer and I got a very
nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  Well, I've, I'm currently in school so I, I've had an I B M clone,
I guess, for a couple of years now, which I've been trying, continually
upgrading I guess.  And, uh, I've found, I've found that I pretty much become
addicted to it and I can't really, I've found that most of homework
assignments (( )) really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or
analysis, so --

A.7:  Huh.

B.8:  -- it, it's pr-, very essential for me.  Schools have them, uh, but lot of
times so difficult to get on them at school.  It's very easy, it's much more
convenient to have one at home.

A.9:  [Lipsmack] Where you going to school?

B.10:  At Georgia Tech.

A.11:  I see.

B.12:  Yeah, so.

A.13:  In engineering?

B.14:  Yes, actually.

A.15:  So that explains wha-, all the, uh, computer assignments.

B.16:  Yeah, it, uh,

A.17:  Well, do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work?

B.18:  Um, sure.  I have some games, [noise] of course, which I play on there and,
uh, uh, [noise] I have a program which allows me to access a, uh, weather data
bank so I can, like, check up on the weather around the country or whatever
((which is)) a hobby.  So, it provides other means other than just strict, uh,
you know, computations and so on, so.  Have you, do you have a computer for
yourself at home?

A.19:  [Lipsmack] No.  No, I just have one for my son and I really sort of have
the feeling that word processing is a big market #for# --

B.20:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.21:  -- home computing.

B.22:  Yeah.  Tha-, 

A.23:  At wo-, at work, uh, [laughter] I'm a technologist, uh, and I, in the past,
have done a great deal of, of, uh, system development just through, uh,
software development programming.  Uh, but now I find myself using the
computer, even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing 
system --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and a communication system.

B.26:  Yeah, yeah.  Do you use Email and like that?  

A.27:  Yes.  Emil is, probably pulls down a third a-, of all my time.

B.28:  Yeah.  It's, I, I, uh, I have modem (( )) night computer so I can log into
the sys-, the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through
there, which is, which can be useful.  But, uh, yeah that's, that and word
processing is ((while)) I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do most of my, almost
all of my report [noise] writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term
papers or even some smaller homework assignments.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  So it's, it's really become, I don't know, really become my mainstay I
guess.  I can't even remember, actually I don't think I've ever used a
typewriter in, in my life to do a, a to do a report.  Because my family, when
I was growing up, we got a basic computer.  T R S Eighty when they first came
out.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high, so
[noise].

A.33:  Huh.  Well I'm a old-timer.  I did my Master's thesis on, uh, a typewriter.

B.34:  Oh, yeah.

A.35:  Uh, I rented an I B M Selectric.

B.36:  Oh.

A.37:  And it was a pretty big deal.  

B.38:  Yeah.  It must have been tough.  It's a little bit strange for me.  I, I
did my Master's thesis, uh, last year and I did that on a computer and it
seems like, I just can't imagine how people did it before.  It must have been
just so much, so much work [noise].

A.39:  Yeah.  It, uh, well, you know, it's just, it was just a completely
different world then.

B.40:  Yeah.  So, uh, (( )) so yo-, you used your son's Macintosh then?  Do you,
do you find it, do you like that kind of computer?

A.41:  I like it, yeah.  I like it from a distance really.  I, I see the packages
on it, uh, that are available and it's nice.  I really don't use it myself.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  Uh, I, when I come home from work, I, I like to stay far away from --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- computers and electronic things [laughter].

B.46:  Huh.

A.47:  Uh, so I let my son do it and,

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Uh, of course, you know, there's, uh, there's an intellectual evolution
taking place where, it's sort of a joke but it's really true, the old-timers,
even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these
electronic things like V C R -s and whatnot and the kids, they just take to it
like candy.

B.50:  Yeah.  Well, i-, if, if, if the interface is there so that it's like fun to
use and the challenge [/tone] [/static],
