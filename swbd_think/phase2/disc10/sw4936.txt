A.1:  Why don't you start?

@B.2:  Oh, I don't know.  I, uh, I refinished a couple of old, uh, dressers that
were gi-, handed down.  You know, nice it's nice tongue and groove, uh, uh,
construction.  Uh, [inhaling] that's been, I've been pretty successful with
that.

A.3:  Things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that?

B.4:  What?

A.5:  Are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that
refinishing?

B.6:  No, I've done some other things too.  Uh, you know.

A.7:  Yeah.  I've done both [throat_clearing].

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  Uh, uh, my wife has picked up a couple of things saying, uh, boy if we
could refinish that, that would be a [noise] beautiful piece of furniture and,
uh, we've done it a couple of times.  I guess #that# --

B.10:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.11:  -- we've been fairly successful with those.  That's, uh, that's a kind of
low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess.

B.12:  Yeah.  That's a good way to get started.  

A.13:  Uh, I have a, a, uh, really nice desk.  A nicer desk than I could afford.
Which [laughter] I got because my sister who worked in a hospital, uh --

B.14:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.15:  -- liberated it after a fire and, uh, we stripped it all the way down and
refinished it and it turned out to be really nice, uh, a nice desk.

B.16:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.17:  Maple top I think or [throat_clearing] or --

B.18:  Uh-huh {very faint} [clink].

A.19:  -- something of that sort.

B.20:  Yeah.  I, I, uh, put together a, a, up rolltop desk from scratch.

A.21:  Oh, really?

B.22:  You know, a kit.

A.23:  Oh.  I'm #jealous.#  

B.24:  #Yeah.#  Still had to cut it and everything, but --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- it was fun.

A.27:  Yeah [throat_clearing].  I, I do do things, uh, that might be too crude to
be called woodworking.  I've built my own deck and, uh --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- [Sniffing] things like that.

B.30:  Yeah.  I, I've done the same.  You know, like the trim around the house
[laughter] you know --

A.31:  And, uh --

B.32:  -- #the baseboards and things like that.#

A.33:  -- #[Throat_clearing] I# definitely have begun to accumulate tools too.
My, I, uh --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's
father owned when he was alive and so I do have a band saw and a router and,
uh, things like that out in the garage.  But I can't say I use them very often
[throat_clearing].

B.36:  Um.  ((Yeah)), I'm looking at trying to get a router right now.  

A.37:  They're handy, uh, #they# --

B.38:  #(( )).#

A.39:  -- they come in handy at the most unusual times.  Putting doors in is the
time when I'm, uh, I bought myself a, uh, template for making mortices and
doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel #[laughter].#

B.40:  #[Laughter]# #I'll bet.#

A.41:  #But I've,# also, I've also used them for building drawers where you, uh,
for rabbeting and, uh, because, uh, rabbeting on my table, on my, uh, radial
arm saw is a little bit uncertain [laughter].

B.42:  [Talking] Uh-huh.

A.43:  So, I got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the
first eight months I had it and now I use it twice a year maybe
[throat_clearing].

B.44:  Yeah.  My br-, my brother's used it a lot for making drawers.  #I don't# --

A.45:  #The big,# 

B.46:  -- know, what, what's your opinion of wha-, what a good router is like?
#You know I,# 

A.47:  #[Throat_clearing] Uh,# I guess it,

B.48:  Because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that
great.  They've plastic parts and stuff.

A.49:  [Throat_clearing] The ones that what?

B.50:  That you dial in on the side.

A.51:  Uh, I have never even s-, I have never even looked at one closely.  Uh,
the, the --

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  -- little use that I've gotten from my router, I would say, uh, I would
spend my money on the bits [laughter].

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  Uh, I have a, I'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router and
the, uh,

B.56:  How strong is it?  

A.57:  [Throat_clearing] It's strong enough for any job where you don't try to
take more than say three-eighths of an inch at a time.  But the problem is
that the, uh, as with any, any time you buy #a, a# --

B.58:  #Don't they,# 

A.59:  -- tool with --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- a, a, as a, as a package --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- the bits that they give you are low end.  

B.64:  [Laughter].

A.65:  [Throat_clearing] So the price of a good set of, uh, carbide steel, uh,
bits is probably, uh, I mean, a, a good set of bits is probably going to run
you a hundred dollars and, uh, uh, if you're going to use for a lifetime I
suppose it's worth it.  Because y-, e-, uh, I imagine if I go and sharpen them
myself, uh, they won't last [throat_clearing].  And I've never had the bits
sharpened [sniffing].  #So.#

B.66:  #Uh-huh.#

A.67:  That's a thing to consider is to,

B.68:  They, they really get hot don't they?

A.69:  Yeah.  And they, they dull after awhile.  Especially, I did some cabinets
in, uh, ash and oak --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- and, uh, that, that wears a bit down.  We remodeled and saved a bunch of
really nice ash cabinets, uh --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- which had been in the original,

B.74:  [Children].

A.75:  remodeling of our kitchen.  

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  [Swallowing] And I saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and
another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth
[throat_clearing].  And, uh,

B.78:  [Talking].

A.79:  routing hardwood will, uh, take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast
[sniffing].  So.

B.80:  Yeah.  I've cut some one by eight oak before [laughter].  Boy was that fun.

A.81:  Right.  That's, uh,

B.82:  Big solid pieces of oak are just --  

A.83:  And then you take the blade to the --

B.84:  -- tough.

A.85:  -- to get sharpened, right [laughter].   

B.86:  [Laughter] Well, that was, you know, with a, with a circular saw.  

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  Like, oh my gosh.  

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  Is this going to be fun [laughter]?

A.91:  Yeah [throat_clearing].  Well I've used mine on treated wood and now all my
blades need sharpening.

B.92:  [Children] Yeah.

A.93:  Because, uh, treated wood will also chew them up.

B.94:  Treated wood can really make you sick too.
