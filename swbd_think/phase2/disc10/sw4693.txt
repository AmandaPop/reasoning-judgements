===========================================================================

A.1:  [Talking] All right.  Have you ever been to a family reunion?

@B.2:  I go to a family every year, religiously #[laughter].#

A.3:  #Oh, wow.  Tell me about that.#

B.4:  [Noise] Well I come from Iowa.  My mother was one of nine children in the
family.  Uh, seven of those children are still living and, uh, the family has
grown, of course, and we get, uh, about a hundred and fifty people a year --

A.5:  Wow!

B.6:  -- that show up at this family reunion.  I had come from a large, like I
said, a large family.  I have forty-four first cousins on my mother's side and
we all know each other pretty well.  And, and, uh, so it's a wonderful
occasion when we get together.  And we don't see everybody each year but, you
know, alternate years we get to see most everybody.

A.7:  Is, uh, [sigh],

B.8:  [Throat_clearing].

A.9:  so what makes the reunion a good reunion [breathing]?

B.10:  Oh.  

A.11:  What do they do?  I mean, they can be real boring.  I've, I've been to a
couple #as a kid.#

B.12:  #[Laughter]# Well you have to go with the right spirit of course.  Uh, I
think what makes our family reunions so good is that we, there is so much love
that is shared there.  Uh,

A.13:  Okay.  So you must keep in touch with each other, uh, other than at the
reunion.  Is that #right?#

B.14:  #Well,# yeah, many of us do.  Actually, uh, I'm in my fifties now.

A.15:  Okay.

B.16:  And my mother came from a generation where the only option was writing.
Postcards, letters, whatever.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Uh, and she used to correspond with her sisters religiously.  And they with
her.  So, and of course, that older generation still always sends all of us
Christmas cards and #it's wonderful [laughter].#

A.19:  #Yeah [laughter].#  #Yeah that's,# 

B.20:  #So, uh,# but it, it, ours is the type of family if I had no place to be, I
could call anyone of my aunts or my cousins and they would say come and stay
with me for a few weeks.

A.21:  Oh, wow.  That is good.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  #It's,# 

A.23:  #So when,# so when you guys have your reunion, uh, now I'm sure that, it
sounds like you guys are pretty satisfied.  What about your, your, uh, how,
what do you do for the kids?

B.24:  Oh well, uh, these attitudes are projected down to the kids.  That this
is the place where we really want to go and,

A.25:  [Noise].

B.26:  and we can have a good time.  It's not a boring thing.  Uh, I guess once in
awhile, about thirteen or so, maybe it's a little boring for them.

A.27:  [/Noise] Yeah #[laughter].#

B.28:  #If, if they haven't been# there enough years to have formed friendships.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  But my kids went every year and therefore they knew, you know, a lot of
the other kids.  So then you kind of look forward to seeing some of these
second cousins once a year.  We do go to, uh, it's Clear Lake, Iowa where we
hold it, and we make every effort in the world to get the shelter house.  So
we have a facility where we can be inside but yet the kids can go and be in
the lake if they want to.

A.31:  Is, is, uh, and, and how do you allocate, uh, I mean how do you decide when
you're going to meet and,

B.32:  Oh and that's set.  It's going to be, it's always the first Sunday after
the Fourth of July.

A.33:  Oh, okay.  Well the first Sunday after the Fourth of July has got to be
hot, right?

B.34:  Oh, it is.  But you can't find any time in Iowa when it's not hot in #the
summertime [laughter].#

A.35:  #[Laughter] That's what I meant.# Could be the springtime or something
#like that.#

B.36:  #Oh, yeah, uh-huh.#

A.37:  #The kids are# --

B.38:  #Well,# --

A.39:  -- still in school then, huh?

B.40:  -- okay.  But Iowa is very agricultural and spring is not a good time to
try to do anything.

A.41:  I see.

B.42:  Because so many were involved with agriculture, so.  So do you have a
reunion?

A.43:  Well, my ki-, my parents, uh, used to have reunions and, and, uh, we'd go
and, and, uh, actually I can remember it as a lot of, a lot of fun but it's
been very tough to talk my kids into the idea of meeting #any of the
relatives.#

B.44:  #Oh.#

A.45:  Uh, I don't know exactly why that's true.  I think part of it's because
they're, uh, they just don't know anybody.  And we, our family is all
scattered out.  We started in California but, uh, now everybody is all over
the United States these days.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  Well, you know, with, as many people as we have, we're all over
the U S too.  But, uh,

A.47:  I, yeah, I, I know that there's a difference but I haven't quite,

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  e-, even locally, uh, I, I guess, I've got a brother that lives, uh, about
a five hour drive from here and I haven't seen him for [breathing] twenty
years so that tells you something #about my,#

B.50:  #Oh, my.#  What did you say your first name was?  

A.51:  Ralph.

B.52:  Ralph.  A Ralph shouldn't act like that #[laughter].#  

A.53:  #No, no I shouldn't.# I'm, uh, I have to admit that it, but when I hear
these, uh, well, of course, I was the last of eight, see.

B.54:  Oh, okay.

A.55:  The very last of eight.  And my parents were both married before and, and,
uh, so I only have half brothers and half sisters.  So that's, I guess that's
part of it.  They were all grown by the time I came along.

B.56:  Oh, I see.

A.57:  And, uh, I shouldn't say all grown, but anyway, it's, it's one of those,
uh, I was always the, you're their, you're their kid and, I'm not saying
they're not nice but, but, uh, #you know, we don't have those# --

B.58:  #[Laughter] Okay,# there's difference.  Yeah.  #Uh-huh.#

A.59:  -- #real# close, uh, uh, I was always the little kid.  I'll put it that
way.  So that's, and then the other side of it, and the other thing too is
that my parents [/talking],
