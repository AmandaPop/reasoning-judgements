============================================================================

A.1:  Are they doing a lot of recycling out in Georgia?

B.2:  Well, [sigh] uh, at my workplace they are.  We have, uh, places for
aluminum cans and we have a, everybody's been issued a separate trash can for,
uh, recycl-, recyclable paper, let's see them get that word straight.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, as far as the community goes, uh, it's pretty much voluntary.  Nothing
has been done.  Uh, I don't, where I live, I live in an unincorporated area
and we don't have any, uh, we have just private, uh, garbage services and, uh,

A.5:  [Cough] {someone in background}.

B.6:  uh, as far as I'm concerned I, I guess I should do it but being lazy I
don't.  If, if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it
up, I would more than gladly participate [laughter].  Uh,

A.7:  Yeah.  I-, i-, it is, it is to some degree inconvenient.  I'd have to say
that.

B.8:  #Uh,# 

A.9:  #Uh,# around here they've given us, mine already got run over, uh, i-, it
looks a little like a milk crate.  A little blue mil-, milk crate and I have
two kids and it's not big enough [laughter].  #It's kind,#

B.10:  #[Laughter].#

A.11:  it's kind of silly.  And what you do is you put out paper, like paper bags
and newspaper and cardboard and that you put separately and you also put out
in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have.

B.12:  Huh.

A.13:  You know, like your Campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind
of stuff and then the rest you can j-, you throw out and the town picks it up.
I've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put
what's left in a clear plastic b-, bag so they can kind of look and see if
you're throwing out what you [laughter] shouldn't.  I thought that was pretty
amusing [laughter].

B.14:  Have the garbage police looking after you, I guess.

A.15:  I imagine.  I don't know.

B.16:  Uh, well I used to live in California and, uh, just before I left they
were, uh, some communities were making that, uh, mandatory and, uh, uh,
fortunately I was in, I was in an apartment complex and for some reason, we
just threw everything in the dumpster [laughter].  That was all right.

A.17:  Well, you know, it's funny.  We just got back from a trip to California
visiting some friends, uh, near San Francisco and San Jose.  And we'd see
these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something,
the apar-, for the apartment dwellers.  They didn't make it easy to recycle at
all.  What they did was, uh, you would bring it to this garbage place that
they designated and the Lions Club or, you know, some community organization
would do you the favor of picking it up from there.  You really had to go out
of your way to recycle.

B.18:  Yeah, you know, and most people probably don't want to carry a couple of
bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles.  Uh, I mean it's all, it's a
good idea, we should all do it, uh, but, uh, if you, from a practical
viewpoint, from a selfish viewpoint, if communities made it easy and
convenient for you to do it, they would have a lot more participation, #in my
opinion.#

A.19:  #Well, around here# I, it's not too bad.  Because on Tuesday's you put out
your paper and your cans and, and plastic things and they go away.

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  So that, I mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your
driveway.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  Uh, my friends in California have this special garbage pail where they
collect all their soda cans --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the
neighborhood kids will grab them #because# --

B.26:  #Oh.#

A.27:  -- they can sell them or something for recycling --

B.28:  Gee, you haven't,

A.29:  -- so, they just leave it out for the vultures to take [laughter].  

B.30:  Gee, kids around here I don't think would pay, well wouldn't pay any
attention to it.  They'd, the dogs would get to it before they would, #I would
imagine.#

A.31:  #Oh.  Well the soda cans where I live# are good for a nickel a piece.  So
#if# --

B.32:  #Wow.#

A.33:  -- you bring them to the local supermarket, they have these can crushers.
And, you know, you throw all the cans in, one at a time, it takes ti-, a lot
of time and you push a button and you get a nickel for every can cause, you
had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it.

B.34:  Oh.

A.35:  And you find these old, old men and these bag people collecting all these
things and hauling them in in big garbage bags.  And they just, like, take up
one of these machines to, to get, you know, a couple of m-, uh, bucks for beer
or something #[laughter].#

B.36:  #Is that a# city or state law that, uh, #requires it to be recycled, or,#

A.37:  #Yeah, it's a state, well New York state# does it and I know Vermont, a lot
of the eastern states do it.

B.38:  Huh.  #(( )).#

A.39:  #So# you get a lot of old people.  One old fellow had crates of beer.  He
made friends with a bar ten-, a bar tender at some bar and he gets all the
beer bottles because the guy can't be bothered with it.  And he said he bought
himself, I said that's pretty heavy for you isn't it?  And he says, well I
just bought myself an old station wagon to cart, you know, this is a real
business for him [laughter].  He's making big bucks #[laughter].#

B.40:  #Gee.  Well I, I guess if you can buy in bulk it [snorting]# #so to speak.#

A.41:  #Well, I guess# at a nickel a shot if these people are retired and they've
got nothing better to do, I mean they can come away with ten, fifteen dollars
at a haul, I guess.

B.42:  Well I bet that's resulted in a, it would seem to me that's resulted in
some cleaner highways, I would imagine.

A.43:  Well you, you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the
beach.  You know, my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that
the bees were attracted to the coke cans and #that was the end of that.#

B.44:  #[Laughter]#  #Surprise, surprise.#

A.45:  #I think it's a fair,# you know, for an eight year old to get three
dollars, like wow [laughter].

B.46:  Gee.  Well that's, uh, well that, you know, a state law like that would
probably encourage people down here, uh, to do it.  Uh, I mean I, I don't 
know,
