=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, the Soviet Union, uh, now really called the Commonwealth of
Independent States, uh, is a mess [laughter].  Uh, I think one of the biggest
things we have to worry about is the, uh, control of nuclear arms.  Especially
Ukraine and Russia.

@B.2:  Yeah.  I, my main concern right now is, first of all, at this point with
the current government and situation, I don't see them as any threat
[inhaling] to us at the moment.  However, with the current state of the
central government being as, uh, tenuous as it is, it wouldn't take much to,
uh, cause a kind of fascist revival within, uh, Russia or any of the
republics.  And then we do have a real clear foreign policy and, a, a, problem
and a threat, because of the number of nuclear weapons that are there.  We
seem to have lost the ability to control what's going on in the country.

A.3:  Right.

B.4:  And any country which has as many nuclear weapons as they do is certainly
is a threat.  But perhaps not at this second.

A.5:  Yeah.  You know, I suppose, you, you say to yourself, what will, no
rational, uh, person would, would, would launch nuclear weapons.  Uh, but I
guess that that wouldn't necessarily hold, uh, for some radical government or
temporary take over even.

B.6:  Well, I work in international radio, uh, [noise] and one of the groups that
we're working with has been Radio Eurovan which is in Armenia.  And I, you
know, in a sense you'd think being [whistling] a, you know, an American or a
western, would make sense that there [/whistling] is no real great threat.
That these people aren't nuts.  But you listen to the, what the Armenians have
to say about their neighbors, the Azerbaijanis --

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  -- and they'd launch in a second if they had an access to those weapons.

A.9:  Jeez!

B.10:  There is a great deal of religious hatred in that part of the world.  And
this is stuff that goes back to the days of Christ [laughter].  #I mean, 
this# --

A.11:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.12:  -- is not a two hundred year war or fifty year, uh, problem.  This goes
back centuries and the amount of hatred.  I mean there's accusations of using
chemical weapons now b-, #on# --

A.13:  #Yeah.#

B.14:  -- both sides.  #And# --

A.15:  #Yeah.#

B.16:  -- it, into republican strife amongst these various, uh, former parts of
the Soviet Union.  I think you could have regional use of nuclear weapons but
I don't think that they see us a threat anymore.

A.17:  Right.  I guess I agree with that.  #Uh.#

B.18:  #[Throat_clearing]# Uh, the other concern is as time,

A.19:  [Cough].

B.20:  goes on.  They could become an economic threat.  #Uh# --

A.21:  #Right.#

B.22:  -- but I think what will happen is they will go through an Asian type of,
uh, introduction into the business world.  Where, beginning, there'll be cheap
labor and, uh, you know, then we'll have an, I'd say thirty years, if things
stay the way things are now, they could become another Korea or Malaysia or
Thailand type of source for cheap labor where American products could be built
and, uh, I think that's where they are headed.

A.23:  Right.  Well, I think that, that there's a, uh, qualitative difference
that, uh, Russia and, and much of the Soviet Union still has a lot a natural
resources that --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- some of those other countries you mentioned just never had.  So that,
uh, e-, you know, the commonwealth states could, could easily, you know,
leapfrog the, uh, the, you know, stepping stone path, uh, laid out by the, by
the Southeast Asian countries.

B.26:  Well, they do have a huge oil reserve.  The problem is that they don't have
the ability to exploit it at this point.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  They could become a major source for oil for us as well as timber and, uh,
other products.  Agriculture could become very important for them using modern
farming techniques in the Ukraine.  And I suspect they will form some sort of
economic union when all is said and done.

A.29:  Yeah, yeah.  #((Get)), we're, we're# --

B.30:  #I don't think, I don't think,# 

A.31:  -- still going through a, a, uh, you know, a settling period.  Uh, you
know, they're not sure who they want their leaders to be.  They're not sure
how they want the, you know, uh, relationships between the states to, to shape
so.  But I agree, you know, we need another couple of years to, to let them,
uh, settle down and, uh, start cooperating.

B.32:  [Throat_clearing] Well I certainly hope that we will, I, I wish we would
incorporate some sort of Marshall plan over there.  Because I think one of the
problems that this country has in dealing with them is we aren't doing enough
right now.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And the chances for things getting out of control and another fascist type
of regime rising are quite good.  Uh, anyone at this point who can give them
food, security and make them, you know, feel some pride again, could become a
major threat.  Especially some of these republics which are striving to become
independent from central Moscow and that kind of administration.  Uh, and if
we don't get our tushes in there [thumping] and spend more effort and money
and funds trying to get things back on the ground there, I think we're in,
