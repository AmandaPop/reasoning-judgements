REMARKS:        Speaker B's line has a funny noise all through the
conversation. 

==========================================================================

A.1:  [Static] Okay.  So we're supposed to discuss job benefits and such.

B.2:  [Noise] Right.

A.3:  Uh, what do you consider that you're lacking in benefits that you have?

@B.4:  That I'm lacking in benefits?

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, the fact that they're not all paid for [laughter].  Uh, I wish
[laughter] they were all paid benefits.  Uh, I share in our health insurance,
uh, half and half.  Uh, I'm also covered under my wife's, so.  But, uh, I
wish, I wish they were all paid for.  I don't have a, a dental benefit.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Uh, and, uh, I guess the benefits that I have, I wish I had more of an 
H M O, a health maintenance as opposed to kind of fix it after it's broken
kind of maintenance.

A.9:  [Inhaling] Well, that's, I've, uh, worked for companies that have had H M O
before and it really is nice.  Particularly, if you aren't, you know, really
set on e-, one specific doctor.  If, if you're flexible.

B.10:  Yeah.  Well, I mean, you get, you get yearly physicals.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Uh, and, I mean, they just seems to make sense to do it that way.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  I guess in a perfect world, in a perfect world, uh, but we aren't in a
perfect world so, I don't know.  Uh, other than that, I don't really have any
benefits per se.  How about yourself?

A.15:  Well, I'm fortunate in that I have, uh, dental and I also have vision care.
The thing that I have had in the past that I wish that my company provided
was, uh, a prescription, a paid prescription plan.  #P-,#

B.16:  #Prescription# drugs?  

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.

A.19:  You know, that they'll cover, uh, like for five dollars or something like
that, that you can get anything that you want.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  But, uh,

B.22:  How about other, other benefits of, of the job?  I mean, do you have, uh,
what kind of time off do you have?  #What# --

A.23:  #Uh,#

B.24:  -- what type of work do you do?

A.25:  I'm an administrative assistant for a software company.

B.26:  Huh.  Okay.

A.27:  And, what about you?

B.28:  I'm a broker.  I work with a, uh, brokerage house and we work with
businesses in brokering their services or goods to other businesses.

A.29:  How large is your company?

B.30:  Oh, not too large.  That's part of the problem with the, uh, the health
care program.  It's prob-, maybe, uh, twelve people.

A.31:  Oh, you're right.  Well, the company I work for, now in my office we have
about eight people, but it's like two thousand people overall.

B.32:  Gotcha.

A.33:  [Inhaling] And, uh, uh, our benefits I guess are pretty good.  You know,
we, well I guess actually we have quite a few offered to us.  We have Four Oh
One K and I get two weeks vacation the first year --

B.34:  #Huh.#

A.35:  -- #and# about, uh, ten holidays, I guess, one of which is a floating
holiday that I can use at my discretion. #((But)),# 

B.36:  #Now# when you say a floating holiday, what do you mean by that?

A.37:  Well, it's just a day that you can use, I guess you'd really consider it a
personal day.

B.38:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  So you have personal days, you, day, uh, I should say
multiple or single?

A.39:  Just single.  

B.40:  Okay.  But you can use, uh, your holi-, your holiday or, uh, vacation times
for split up into personal days?

A.41:  I'm sorry?

B.42:  Can you split your holiday or vacation time into personal days?  

A.43:  [Inhaling].

B.44:  Or do you have to take them in bulk?

A.45:  Uh, the vacation I think I can split.  You know, I don't have to take it
two, or a week at a time or anything like that.

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  The holiday, uh, th-, the one day I think I can just put it anywhere that I
want to.

B.48:  Huh.  #Tha-, that#

A.49:  #So, that's# nice.

B.50:  Oh, yeah.  Uh, does your company do picnics or, you know, like, uh,
tomorrow our company, as a whole, and I guess I would call this a benefit
[laughter] is, uh, we're going to the Red Sox home opener in, uh, Boston.

A.51:  That's a benefit.  No, #we# --

B.52:  #Yeah.#

A.53:  -- don't do anything like that #[laughter].#

B.54:  #Yea-, d-,# you know, do you have any like company picnics or, uh, or
get-togethers or things along those lines?

A.55:  I don't think so.  As a matter of fact, I've only been with the company a
month and a half.  #And# --

B.56:  #Oh.#

A.57:  -- uh, I, I asked my boss, I think we do have a Christmas party although he
indicated the budget is kind of low.

B.58:  It alwa-, it usually is.

A.59:  [Laughter] Well.  But then with just, uh, ten of us in the office, you
know, as far as a company picnic or anything, I don't think that there's
enough of us, you know, to, to get together and do something like that.

B.60:  Huh.

A.61:  But, uh, uh, the office is pretty free, you know, as far as if I decide
that I want to go out to lunch with someone and I'm late coming back, no one
complains or says anything about it and if I need some time off to go to a
doctor they wouldn't penalize me for that.

B.62:  That's good.  #I was,#

A.63:  #And that# counts.

B.64:  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, the environment you work in is, is, uh,
crucial to the job.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  Uh, we have somewhat, we're somewhat in the same situation.  Uh, I mean I
feel [noise] I feel odd about taking any personal time anyway unless, you
know, they knew about it or whatever but --

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  -- uh, but being a sales organization, we, you know, our time is our own.
I mean, we're kind of independent contractors --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- under a common goal type of thing.  So, it's kind of the same situation.
Although it sounds like your office structure is more structured as an office
time, uh, but you, it's not so rigid that, you know, you punch a clock, that
type of thing [/noise].

A.71:  Well, a lot of it depends on your position too.  You know, other people
that are in sales in the office, they come and go [/static],
