A.1:  [Scratching] {sounds like she is twisting the receiver} Do you happen to
have a system for budgeting your money?

B.2:  Uh.  I swear I heard that beep but usually you can hear the tape or you can
hear it starting [lipsmack].  Uh --

A.3:  Oh, I've never.  Go ahead.

B.4:  -- uh, no #[laughter].#

A.5:  #[Laughter].#

@B.6:  No.  I am a very organized person that believes I ought to have all those
things and we don't.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  So, you, it's not just you.  You have a family?  

B.8:  Yes.  I'm married.  I have two kids.  Uh, young.  Four and a half and three
and I, as far as setting down and putting a formal budget, paper and pin, you
know, and following it.  No, we don't do that.  Uh, I have a very good idea of
what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and,
you know, so i-, it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's
going on [laughter].  But I wish we were a little more organized.  A little
more --

A.9:  You know, #when I think about it# --

B.10:  -- #faithful to a budget.#

A.11:  -- there are certain parameters we work about but we don't have a budget
where it says its so much for this and so much for that.  But we do put a
certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the
mortgage #and# --

B.12:  #Right.#

A.13:  -- the electric bill and all that.  And I know there's a certain number I
put on my grocery and pocket money and sometimes I have a little left over and
I kind of put it away.  But the next week I pull it out and,

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  add it to that number.

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  And I know that I don't go above that and I know that when we empty out the
mortgage and the electric bill money and all that, that, you know, you got to
stop spending #[laughter].  But# --

B.18:  #That's right, that's right.#

A.19:  -- you know, I, I don't know if I can say, I guess with the grocery and
pocket money I do have a particular number.  But, you know, you never know.
If, if you own a home, you never know if something's going to break and you're
going to need more.

B.20:  That's right.  Well it's very difficult.  My husband is in, is
self-employed.  He's in, uh, financial planning and, and so all of his income
is commission.  And it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't
know what he's going to make.  Uh, you know, we kind of think, you know, he
usually brings home at least this much.

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  And I can base, you know, base it from there.  But there's months that he
brings home, uh, you know, three times that much and there's some months he
doesn't bring home anything.  It just depends on where the commissions fall.
And so you kind of have to, you know, I ha-, in my mind I know the basics.  I
know what we've got to meet each month, you know.  And, and my salary helps
towards that because mine's set, you know.  But, uh, I think that we could
probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd
like to do, if I did follow a, you know, pencil and paper budget but.

A.23:  Do you folks get to save?

B.24:  [Lipsmack] Well, differently.  I mean, do I have a savings account sitting
in the bank?  No.  But, uh, we do have, you know, universal life insurance on
him.  We have, uh, a Four Oh One K, a CODA plan, preretirement plan on me
through my work.  Uh, so there are things that we have money invested in, you
know.  I have a profit sharing and pension, savings more toward retirement
now.  Savings sitting at the bank that hey, let's plan a vacation, no.  When
we decide we want to do something like that, we start saving for that and when
we get it we go.

A.25:  Right.  You know, cause I'm finding more and more that people don't have so
many dollars left after they spend on what they have to spend.  I, I think
it's the rare person who says well, I'm just putting money away for my kids.
And, and every week #puts in# --

B.26:  #Right.#

A.27:  -- fifty dollars or something.  I don-, I think people aren't having much
left at all nowadays.

B.28:  I think it's more and more difficult.  I do have savings accounts for my
kids at work.  And, uh, and I use that for their, uh, life insurance
investments.  Uh, but I also pull from that and from mine if we need the
money.  You know, #if you need it for something or like you said the# --

A.29:  #Right.  That come from somewhere [laughter].#

B.30:  -- something comes up on the house and you've got to have it, well you go
deplete those funds [laughter] and use it, #you know.#

A.31:  #Yeah.#  I work part-time.  I'm a substitute art teacher.

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  So, you know, we try to live on my husband's salary and when I want
[clicking] something frivolous that he probably wouldn't agree to, I
just, you know, spend my own money [laughter].

B.34:  That's true.

A.35:  Or chipping in when, #you know# --

B.36:  #Yeah.#

A.37:  -- something big comes up.

B.38:  Now, we have an interesting arrangement.  My husband loves golf and I'm
glad he ha-, I mean it's his release.  It's his time each week where he's not
dad and he's not husband and he's not employee and ((he)), [laughter] you know
what #I'm saying?  It's just a release.#

A.39:  #I thought you said when he's not# dead [laughter] not dad #[laughter].#

B.40:  #No, dad [laughter].  Dad [laughter].#

A.41:  #Well, jeez [laughter].#

B.42:  #Not dead [laughter].# I'll have to work on that.  Uh, and, and I'm glad he
has that.  I'm glad he enjoys it.  But I used to resent it because I felt like
all of our spare money went to his golf.  I don't particularly have anything I
like to do from week to week, or day to day or, or anything like that and
that's fine.  Uh, and so what I started doing and he's never said, you know,
if I wanted something I'd look in the checkbook because I'm to practical and
say naw I'd better not spend the money.

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  Well, he's never held me back.  You know, he's always said if you want
something go get it.  But I didn't feel comfortable.  So now when he goes and
golfs, I take, you know, if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty
bucks, I take the same amount and I stick it in a savings account that I have
at the credit union at work.

A.45:  Oh.

B.46:  [Swallowing] And I save for something I want.  Because,
