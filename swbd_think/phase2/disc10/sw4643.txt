==========================================================================

A.1:  You interested in woodworking?

@B.2:  Yeah.  Actually, I, uh, I guess I am [laughter].  Um, it just seems kind
of funny that this is a topic of discussion.  Uh, I do, uh, some, uh,
woodworking myself [noise].  Uh, in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right
now making a bed for my son.

A.3:  Um.  #What kind of# --

B.4:  #It's, uh,# 

A.5:  -- pine?

B.6:  It's, uh, it's, uh, plywood, uh, face, I guess.  But I cut it out in the
shape of a crayon box and then I painted, uh, about eight different, uh,
colors, uh, you know, the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the
headboard --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  #I guess he's young.# 

B.8:  -- #and then,#  yes [laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  He's about five and a half years old.

A.11:  Oh, he'll be delighted.

B.12:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Now I just have to finish it though.  I got, uh, it got
delayed for a little bit and, uh, because of work and now, uh, I've got to
jump back in and finish the, because I've got it all cut out, it's all, uh,
I've done most of the coloring but I've got to go a second layer with the
yellow.

A.13:  Did you do it with a jigsaw or do you have powered, #you know, a,# 

B.14:  #Uh, yeah.# Uh, I did, uh, jigsaw, uh, and the, uh, regular straight saw
for some of it.

A.15:  Um.

B.16:  So yeah.  (( )) to do the, uh, th-, the turn cut.  Uh, how about yourself?

A.17:  Well I'm, I am interested in woodworking.  I don't have lots of tools.  Our
local schools have adult education in the evening --

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  -- uh, and I use their tools m-, a-, an-, and, some of their guidance.  I'm
an artist.

B.20:  Oh, okay.

A.21:  And I'm very handy and, you know, if I touch it, it turns into something
#[laughter] us-,# --

B.22:  #That's great.#

A.23:  -- usually.  #I'm,# 

B.24:  #What,# what type of art do you focus on?  

A.25:  Uh, well actually, I'm very, you know, I have a Master's degree and, and my
projects had to do with acrylic painting, but I'm really interested in the
crafts.

B.26:  #Huh.#

A.27:  #I# make stain glass.  I've done some silver jewelry making and I kind of,
once I get so-, you know, really pretty good at something, I want to try
something else [laughter].

B.28:  Yeah.  Kind of jack of all trades, master of none.

A.29:  Yeah, well no, actually, I get good enough to sell it or have people say oh
wow, you didn't buy it, you made it.

B.30:  That's great!

A.31:  And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone [laughter] so let's do
something else.

B.32:  Right.  You want {mispronounced} to, uh, e-, explore a new field #or, 
or,# 

A.33:  #Well,# yeah, I, I, m signed up for a class in pottery making [laughter]
because I've never tried that yet --

B.34:  Huh.  #So you# --

A.35:  -- #but,#

B.36:  -- have a M F A in, in what #division of art?#

A.37:  #Well, I, I# actually have a Masters of art and it's in art education.

B.38:  Oh, okay.

A.39:  So, I'm a licensed teacher but jobs being what they are, I substitute 
teach --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- and that way I have time for my kids too.  And I've been fortunate that
I can afford to work part-time.  I don't know how long that's going to last
[laughter].

B.42:  Oh, yeah.

A.43:  And, uh, they're cutting back, so I don't go in all that often but --

B.44:  Huh.

A.45:  -- I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of
things.

B.46:  Yeah [noise].

A.47:  Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars and I say, oh
no and, and I go and I make it.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  That's how I started jewelry making.  I, I love to cook.

B.50:  Oh, that's great.

A.51:  And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver
spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of #stuff# --

B.52:  #Huh.#

A.53:  -- and I went and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you
know, get someone to guide you and you get the tools #you don't# --

B.54:  #Yeah.#

A.55:  -- feel like buying.

B.56:  Exactly.

A.57:  And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty
dollars [noise] [swallowing].  It took me a lot of time #but# --

B.58:  #Oh,# yeah.     

A.59:  -- it didn't, but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know, #and then I,# 

B.60:  #And your# time, then you're that much farther ahead [noise].  

A.61:  Yeah.  Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.  It was
a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.

B.62:  Right.  I've seen them and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the
#seeds painted in and,# 

A.63:  #Oh, yeah.#  Uh-huh.

B.64:  That's neat.  

A.65:  I went there, we have Home Depot out here.  I don't know #if you've heard
of it.  I went and I got# --

B.66:  #Yes.  We have one.#

A.67:  -- two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.  I had to cut
into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath and --

B.68:  #Huh.#

A.69:  -- #cutting# that wedge out was no joke [laughter].

B.70:  Oh, I'm, I'm sure.

A.71:  [Laughter]  We did it on a, I had a, uh, #I did it# --

B.72:  #A band saw?#

A.73:  -- through Adult Ed again.  

B.74:  What?

A.75:  I did it through Adult Ed again.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  And the teacher was one of these negative people, oh that's dangerous, we
can't do that, we just can't do that.  And I'm going well how about this way?
I, I want to do that, that was the plan here [laughter].

B.78:  Right.

A.79:  So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of --

B.80:  A cradle for it.

A.81:  -- a cradle #for it.#

B.82:  #Yeah,# so you can steady it and then, you used a handsaw or a #backsaw?#

A.83:  #Well, it,# the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw but
there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon
#[laughter] that# --

B.84:  #Right, right.#

A.85:  -- and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.  I said I'm not
that steady, it's not going {mispronounced} to happen.

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  So we built a cradle for it and we got th-, once it was turned, we got one
s-, one cutout on the table saw, on the radial saw,

B.88:  [Inhaling].

A.89:  by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was
something you had to think about [laughter].

B.90:  Right.

A.91:  #So,# 

B.92:  #Now# did you cut a quarter wedge in this?

A.93:  Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth.  #You know# jus-, 

B.94:  #Well, I,# I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a water-, a watermelon like a log and
then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,
it's, uh, if you're looking at adding on you have,
