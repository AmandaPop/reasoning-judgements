==========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I don't know about you, but, uh, I work outside the home and, uh, in
fact, [static] uh, I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and I work
different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where I don't have I
don't have the family time.  Uh, when my husband gets home, it's usually, he's
home with my daughter alone and then a couple of hours later I'm home.  Uh, I
don't know, I'm finding that more and more people that I talk to, there's less
and less family time available to them.  And, uh, it seems that business wise,
uh, in the business community, or your employers seem to be taking more and
more time away from the family.  So, you know, if you do have any time, it's
kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done,
uh, ju-, just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home
and then, plus try to have that relationship with your children, and it, it's
sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.

@B.2:  I agree [snorting].

A.3:  And, you know, I look at my daughter and she's now, uh, four, going to be
four and I keep saying oh jeez, I don't have that much time with her
[laughter].

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  And she's growing fast and,

B.6:  I know that I have three children.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And, uh, I stay home.  I don't work.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  And, uh, I know that it, it must be really challenging to, uh, try to
juggle a job and, and also your children.  Because I know my husband, if I
were gone as much as he is --

A.11:  Yes.  Yeah {faint}.

B.12:  -- we wouldn't have the influence on them that I would want to put on them.

A.13:  Sure.  #Exactly.#

B.14:  #And# I also notice that the children that come over here to play --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- that go to daycare every day --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- they don't like to be around adults.  

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  They don't want to play around adults.  They don't want to be around you.
They don't want you to tell them what to do.  They want to do their own thing.

A.21:  Sure.

B.22:  And they're the very same age as my children.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  #Exactly.#

B.24:  #And I'm# finding as I volunteer up at the school, I just, being, uh, I'm
not educated at all in, uh, really detecting this but I can talk to the
teacher and tell them, on a pretty good basis, after I've worked up at the
school for a couple of weeks --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- which kids go to daycare and which kids stay home.

A.27:  Sure, sure.

B.28:  And you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the
adults that, uh, the ones that are, are home and the ones even that are at
home that are getting the love and attention that they need.

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  Not that the kids that go out aren't #getting that# --

A.31:  #Yeah, yeah.#

B.32:  -- it's just a different, they're, they are more use to being with their
own age kids --

A.33:  Sure.

B.34:  -- they're not use to being with adults and to #responding# --

A.35:  #Sure.#

B.36:  -- to adults.

A.37:  Sure.  #Yeah, I, I (( )),#

B.38:  #Uh, I think the trend in the United# States, I feel really bad that it's
turned so much --

A.39:  #I think so too.#

B.40:  -- #to where the children# are, #uh,#

A.41:  #In# fact, uh, I spent the first three years at home with my daughter, so
I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that.  And I did
notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare and I
thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or
four weeks or two weeks or three weeks, whatever the employer says you have to
be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work, whether it be
six weeks or three or four.  But how these women must feel to place their
children into care and, you know, it's our society saying yes, this, uh, you
need this job.  It's a little bit financial type thing because, uh, if you
look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, uh, their
standards of living are a lot less than what ours are #and# --

B.42:  #Right.#

A.43:  -- that's part of it too.  But, uh, like my husband was saying, maybe some
of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the
nineteen fifties, uh, were staying at home with their kids and then made the
decision, well, jeez, you know, I'll go out and get a part-time job.  Got a
part-time job and then financially, they got themselves into well, I'll have
the boat, I'll have the car #and# --

B.44:  #Right.#

A.45:  -- it's nice and really women, past generation women have done it to women
of this day and age too, uh, because it is now, our financial situations are
as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now
#and,# 

B.46:  #It's# hard.  It really is hard.  I know that my husband and I have to do a
lot of #sacrificing# --

A.47:  #Uh-huh.#

B.48:  -- to keep me home.    

A.49:  Sure, I #did it# --

B.50:  #And, uh,# 

A.51:  -- for three years and, uh, it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
and pretty soon, you know, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay,
you've sacrificed for, you know, so many years at home and you're not getting
any further, you know, along --

B.52:  Right.

A.53:  -- and you have to make that decision to go back to work part-time or go
back to work full-time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough
one.

B.54:  Right.  #I think# --

A.55:  #And I,# 

B.56:  -- one of the things that people look at too though, is, uh, spen-, how
they spend their time with their children --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- I think with working moms, if you can get them ma-, the bosses to give
you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year-round school
where you work,

A.59:  Sure.
