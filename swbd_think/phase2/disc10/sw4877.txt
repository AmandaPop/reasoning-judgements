==========================================================================

B.1:  [Child_talking] [talking] [baby_crying].

A.2:  [Clicking] Okay.  Uh, so your, you, I guess you're probably in the same,
uh, same situation uh, we're in.  We're kind of past having to provide child
care.  Our, our kids are grown up.  We don't have any grandchildren yet.  But,
uh, uh, they're,

B.3:  Uh-huh.  How old are your children?  

A.4:  Uh, one's twenty-six and the other is, uh, twenty, twenty-one.

B.5:  Uh-huh [/baby_crying].  

A.6:  So they're, uh, uh,

B.7:  Well, they're going to be getting there.

A.8:  They're, they're getting there.  You know, #there's no# --

B.9:  #Yeah.#

A.10:  -- no, no prospects right away for anything to happen.  

B.11:  U-, uh-huh.  Oh, I see.

A.12:  But, uh,

B.13:  I have, uh, five children.  I have a eighteen year old son.  The ((rest))
of my girls are like twenty-three, twenty-six, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine.

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  And I have three granddaughters right now.

A.16:  Oh.

B.17:  And, uh, I, uh, [sigh] one's in Iowa.

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  And, uh, she's, she's a teacher and what she does is she,

A.20:  [Noise].

B.21:  teaches at a preschool.

A.22:  #Oh, okay.#

B.23:  #And,# and so she kind of, and they let her bring her, her little daughter
in for free.

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  And then, so (( )) but she just works part-time.

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  Then I have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah and she has to work
full-time and it's just tearing her apart.  She has a private baby-sitter.

A.28:  Yeah.

B.29:  And, uh, the baby just screams.  I mean, the baby is like seventeen months
and she just screams.

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.
They're not even there yet --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- you know.  

A.34:  Yeah.  It's #hard.  We,# 

B.35:  #And,# and then I have my, uh, uh, I have a seven month old granddaughter
and, uh, her mother stays home and she, they live, they live with us.  You
know, in, as Orange County --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- is really expensive.

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  They live with us and so, of course, we love it.  Because we get to see
this cute little baby all the time.  But, uh, uh, she just, uh, she used to
work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care and she says after
working in there and, and, you know, here she was a provider but, you know,
there's only so much one person can do.

A.40:  Yeah.

B.41:  She said it's so awful.  She said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in
a preca-, in a p-, in a preschool.

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere.

A.44:  Huh.

B.45:  But it's really, it's really, really very difficult #and,# 

A.46:  #Yeah.#  What did you do when your kids were growing up?  Were you,

B.47:  Well, when, when the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve
years, I stayed home.

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  And, uh, then after that I, I went to work.  

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times I just, uh, uh, you know, th-, then I
had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government
seeded type job.  And then, and then like about, later I, I tried to get the
baby to a baby-sitter.  Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the
church and I knew her personally.  She had two kids of her own and everything.
But I quit my job because I couldn't stand how she was taking care of my
child.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time.  So when my
son stayed over there, he got sick.

A.54:  He got sick, #yeah.#

B.55:  #Same thing,# same thing that the, her kids had, right?

A.56:  Right.  #Well,# 

B.57:  #And so,# uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven
o'clock.  Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over t-, to
kindergarten.  But s-, that day, uh, I was saying now he, he's sick.  And she
goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have.  That's what
he got, you know.  Goes, well, okay, so it's not like he's going to infect her
kids.  But then what happened was, is, I said, uh, he just threw up and
kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and
he'll probably just sleep anyway.

A.58:  [Noise].  

B.59:  Well, you know, what that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten.  She
sent him to kindergarten.  As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look
at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him
in the nurse's office.

A.60:  ((Guess so)), yeah.

B.61:  And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they
knew that she was my baby-sitter.  Called her and they said, uh, [swallowing]
that he's sick.  Well she wasn't home.

A.62:  Huh.

B.63:  I mean her, all her kids were sick but she wasn't home, right.  And her,
and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to
school because she was sick.  Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home
with her?  No, she didn't do that.  So, it got to the point where he's, he's
supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty.  And I had to
leave work.  It was, it was five o'clock in the evening and I found out he was
still there at school.  And they were calling me and they said somebody's got
to pick him up.  And I kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she
was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from
the school.  I was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all
that kind of stuff.  And he had a hundred and four fever.  They couldn't, uh,
give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and #everything.#

A.64:  #Right.#

B.65:  I was so furious.  I, I quit that job and I stayed home for awhile longer.
Then I went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where I can kind of adjust my
time a little bit better.

A.66:  Yeah, a little more flexibility.  You can #come and go.#

B.67:  #Yeah, but,# uh, I haven't had any good, really very good #experience with
child care  [/child_talking] [/talking].#

A.68:  #Yeah.  When, when# our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good
women who, uh, would often c-, uh, get them to come to the house.
