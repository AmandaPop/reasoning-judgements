A.1:  and avid camper?

@B.2:  Um, I'm a more of a want to be #[laughter].#

A.3:  #Uh-huh [laughter].#

B.4:  Uh, my wife, uh, uh, was an only child but her family, all though her
adolescence, had a, uh, small pull behind trailer [inhaling] so they didn't go
out necessarily camping in tents and such but they did a lot of weekend, uh,
[breathing] trips all through the midwest and the east.  Uh, Lancaster,
Pennsylvania and so forth and so on.  They did a lot of traveling with that so
[swallowing] if you can count that as camping which some people may or may
not, uh, she had a lot of experience with that and when we first, uh, got
engaged and got married, we, you know, kind of hung around and did a lot of
stuff with her folks, uh, till they sold the trailer and then finally they
passed away.  But, don't have a whole lot of experience or opportunities to,
but we're, we're all kind of want to be -s here at the family.

A.5:  There is sort of a wide range of camping opportunities.  I remember when I
was a kid, my, my only experience was when I was about thirteen or so and it,
the Y camp used to have an overnight every so often --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and we'd cut down a couple of saplings or, yo-, nowadays you wouldn't
[laughter] cut down saplings #I guess.#

B.8:  #Yeah, I know# what you mean.

A.9:  And we'd lash them up which (( )) was tying and we'd make sort of a
triangular thing --

B.10:  #Sure.#

A.11:  -- #you# know, with a tarp over the top.

B.12:  There you go.

A.13:  And, uh, sleeping bag.  Dug a hole, made a fire.  Uh, the old shovel with
the toilet paper over it.  So, that, I think that's real legitimate camping.
Uh, just recently, uh, my husband and I and our kids joined a friend whose
parents has one of the, have one of these big Silver Bullet trailers that --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- they parked in upstate New York and I chuckled when I got there.  There
was a microwave oven.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And a gas burner stove #and# --

B.18:  #Uh-huh.#

A.19:  -- five bunk beds and heat for the evening.  I mean,

B.20:  That's, that's more like a mobile home --

A.21:  Yeah.  #But it# --

B.22:  -- #not a camper.#

A.23:  -- was so big that, you know, they don't use it mobilely.  It just, you
know, you, you pull it somewhere and you leave it #there.  It's# --

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#

A.25:  -- sort of like a summer house I guess #[laughter].#

B.26:  #Yeah.#

A.27:  And I guess that's camping too.  Uh,

B.28:  I guess.  My kid, you know, my kids go to the Y M, uh, or go to the, uh,
Girl Scout camp.  Uh, there are several of them here in southwest Ohio that
are all run by the same, uh, council [inhaling].  And they're usually there
for a week, each, during the summer at some point.  So they're, they do a lot
more rustic camping but most of their meals are served in the mess hall.  I
think they have one or two outings where they cook at the campsite, uh, out in
the fringes of the, uh, of the park --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- rather than, uh, than at th-, than at the [swallowing] mess hall so they
get some of it.  The only other opportunity really that I get anything like
that is, uh, in the summer, uh, [swallowing] I'm a ham radio operator.

A.31:  Oh, tell me about it.  You ready for Dayton?  

B.32:  Oh, can't wait.

A.33:  [Laughter].  

B.34:  It's like a pilgrimage to Mecca [swallowing].

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  But it's, and it's very convenient for me because it's only forty-five
minutes up the road.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  But, uh, for field day which is an exercise in the summer where ham, you
know, it, it's a couple of things.  It's supposed to be a, uh, a demonstration
of how the ham community can be mobilized to operate under simulated emergency
or field conditions.

A.39:  I think I've heard something about this.  You go set up a tower, right?

B.40:  Yeah, or well some people set up towers.  Other people use a fishing line
and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- depending on how energetic the club is.  But, uh, [swallowing] you know,
it, it's also a contest to see how many other ham stations you can contact who
are doing the same thing and then it's also a chance to get out with your
buddies and drink beer and play radio all night.  Or, if, if, you know, we
have a number of women in the club also.  But i-, you know, it's a chance to
get out with your friends and drink beer and play radio all night.  But we do
go out to one of the local city, city municipal, whatever parks, uh, here in
Cincinnati and, uh, you know, go up on top of a tall hill and string some
wires up in the trees and such and, uh, put out the picnic tables and, uh,
lawn chairs and set up the equipment with a generator and set up a tent for
the kids to sleep in or for the people who are, who are, uh, taking a break
to, to go off and sleep in and then use propane stove to cook breakfast at six
o'clock the next morning with and that's about as close to camping as I really
have much of a chance to get right now.

A.43:  Uh, right, I mean, you know, there's not that much free time and, I don't
know, uh, we, we daydream about going camping #I guess.#

B.44:  #Uh-huh.#

A.45:  Uh, there's a very nice state park around here, uh, that, we're on Long
Island --

B.46:  Oh, #uh-huh.#

A.47:  -- #and, uh,# near (( )) if you've every heard of it with ((light)) house
out there.  There's a beach state park where you can, you know, they have tent
sites.  I guess we'd have to rent all that stuff and --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- there's picnic tables and there's the beach and I guess it's pretty
popular.  It's sort of a, uh, lottery for who gets it and you have to apply at
the right time and people in the know, know how to do that and we keep
thinking about doing it,
