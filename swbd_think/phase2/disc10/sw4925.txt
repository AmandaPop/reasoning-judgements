============================================================================

B.1:  I don't really know any elderly,

A.2:  [Click].

B.3:  uh, in, uh, homes or anything [clicking].  

A.4:  [Noise] No, I, #hello.#

B.5:  #Care of# the elderly, I guess is, uh,

A.6:  Yeah.  I haven't given much thought to it.  I'm kind of busy raising my
kids.  The only way I can relate to it is,

B.7:  [Clicking].

A.8:  I think of my mother taking care of her parents.

B.9:  Yeah.

A.10:  And I remember her running over there every morning to make sure they got
dressed and, and,

B.11:  [Clicking].

A.12:  fed and cleaned and, uh, I remember her saying to me, I hope, don't ever
let me do that to you.

B.13:  [Laughter].

A.14:  Put me in a home because it's, it's hellish on the person who has to give
the care to a person like that, #you know these.#

B.15:  #They have,# uh, around here they've got these, uh, they're like, uh,
condos.

A.16:  Uh-huh.

B.17:  Uh, complexes and they're, uh, #geared to,#

A.18:  #Oh, for senior citizens?#

B.19:  Yeah, elderly and senior citizens.  And they have, I think, uh, like a
nurse on staff there, #and they take care of some of that kind of thing.#

A.20:  #Oh.  Oh, I don't think, yeah,# I don't think the problem is, I mean those
condos are like elderly people just living in their own apartments [squeak].
I think the trouble begins when they have more physical problems.

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  I mean it's got to be humiliating to have a stranger, a nurse or somebody
lift you in and out of a bathtub.

B.23:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.24:  You know.  Because, I mean, I'm, I'm not aged but I'm, I'm forty-one now
and,

B.25:  [Laughter].

A.26:  I still feel twenty something --

B.27:  Yeah.

A.28:  -- and I realize that my body is kind of traitorous and, and changing on me
even though I'm not feeling terribly old.

B.29:  [Laughter].

A.30:  So I can imagine, you know, c-, being eighty and somebody has to dress you
and you're probably sitting there thinking, my God, this is so degrading
#[laughter].#

B.31:  #[Laughter].#

A.32:  But your body just won't do it.

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  #Tha-,#

B.35:  #Well,# I don't know.  I don-, I'm not sure that, uh, this is necessarily
true d-, even if they're eighty, you know.  Because you can, a lot of people,
uh, maintain their, their, uh, fitness and so forth right on #((up)).#

A.36:  #Well I,# I think nowadays people are making that effort to eat right and
to be more fit and I think old age is getting older.

B.37:  Yeah.  That's a definitely, uh, that's statistically true [sniffing].  

A.38:  Huh.

B.39:  #Uh,# 

A.40:  #Are# your parents alive?  

B.41:  My dad's eighty-five, I think, right now.  #Eighty-five.#

A.42:  #Do,# and he fends totally for himself?

B.43:  Yep.

A.44:  That's wonderful [laughter].

B.45:  He still [laughter], yeah, he was having a little trouble getting his
driver's license.  He lives down in Florida.

A.46:  [Laughter].

B.47:  Where I was raised, but, uh [laughter].

A.48:  That's great.  (( )) That looks good for you too, you know [laughter].

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  Longevity in the family.

B.51:  Right.  Yeah, and my grandmother was, lived to a pretty ripe old age too.
Of course she was in a home when she lo-, you know, her, her mind went.  My
dad's is still pre-, you know, pretty well with it.

A.52:  Well, I, you know, my thought is if your mind goes at the same rate your
body goes, then nobody cares right?  #You know, it's like,#

B.53:  #[Laughter].#

A.54:  animals when they're stupid, what the hell do they know #[laughter].#

B.55:  #Yeah, right.#  #I guess.#

A.56:  #I# think if one goes before the other is when you run into [laughter]
trouble [squeak].

B.57:  Yeah.  Well, that, like that, uh, what is it, uh, [tsk] that disease of
the,

A.58:  Alzheimer's?

B.59:  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be awful.

A.60:  [Talking] Well I think that kind of thing is probably awful for everybody
around you.

B.61:  Yeah, #yeah, really.#

A.62:  #I think these# people don't rightly know what they're doing.  

B.63:  Yeah, it's hard to say.  

A.64:  Yeah, that's true.

B.65:  I had a friend that got that and he was fairly young.  I think he was in
his like late thirties or forties or something like that.

A.66:  Well, #is that something that# --

B.67:  #I imagine a little older.#

A.68:  -- is that something that affects you all the time or do you kind of like
wave in and wave out of it?

B.69:  [Sigh] I don't know.  I think it does come and go to some extent.  But it
just keeps continually getting worse, you know.

A.70:  [Talking] Well, that doesn't, doesn't sound too pleasant.

B.71:  No it isn't [laughter].

A.72:  Well, I, you know, I, talking about what would you look for if you had to
put someone in a home, I guess, uh, I don't know.  I guess a place that has
the most activities, you know.  Keeping your mind alive even if you couldn't
do very much.

B.73:  Uh-huh.  You'd have to go, uh, I guess you'd have to go kind of try and pay
them surprise visits and see if you could tell what the atmosphere was like
and so forth.

A.74:  Yeah, that's, that's true.

B.75:  If they were, uh, seemed to be [sniffing] caring or whether they were just
[throat_clearing] warehousing them [laughter].

A.76:  Yeah.

B.77:  There's a lot of them like that I'm afraid.  

A.78:  Well, you know, you, nobody takes care of your own as well as you would.  

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  I was brought up in, in a city where everybody lived in apartment buildings
and there wasn't any room to, you know, wasn't houses.  There wasn't a room to
take in the elderly.

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  So, if and when they couldn't take care of themselves, they couldn't move
in with you [noise] because you had a three room apartment or something.

B.83:  [Laughter].

A.84:  So, you know, that's why they went somewhere else [/noise].  

B.85:  Where, in the city?

A.86:  You know, my life's changed.  Now, I,
