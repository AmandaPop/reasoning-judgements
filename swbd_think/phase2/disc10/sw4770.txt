=========================================================================

A.1:  [Clicking] [talking] Uh, I don't know.  My personal perception of
government and, uh, the way things are at this current time, is that nobody
can really be trusted.  And I don't feel that too many of the candidates are
out there to, uh, be self-serving to the community.  I think that they have
their own, uh, wishes to, uh, be in the limelight and to kind of say, hey, you
know, I'm a public official, I don't have to do, uh, certain things and they
just stand out more.  Involving themselves more and more with politics but
it's really, after all the things that I've seen in the last ten years about
government and now the overdrafts, uh, of checks, uh, before that it was the
wonderful, uh, escapade that they had with, uh, the new, uh, oh ((God)), chief
of, uh, well Supreme Court, I'm trying to think of his name and, uh, what they
put, uh, him through in #regards to,# 

B.2:  #[Breathing] Thomas?#

A.3:  Yeah, Thomas.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  The sex, sexual harassment, that kind of thing and just to see our
government react to that and then just little things that have added up where
people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that.  I, I
just think it's very corrupt and [cough] {someone in background} whether or
not they need to start with people that are [clicking] extremely poor,

B.6:  [Noise].

A.7:  and send them into government versus people that are rich.  But it's always
the rich person that gets into government.  That has the money to advertise,
the money to d-, to do this.  There's no more Abe, Abraham Lincolns out there,
uh, that can get into government, even if they were poor.  So, I know that's
my personal viewpoint of things.

B.8:  Doesn't Wisconsin have a, uh, state, uh, Medicare program or #health
program?#

A.9:  #Now, they# just, uh, they've already put through the health bill
[clicking].  Yes.  It just went through and it was passed and that is going to
be a heavier tax burden on [barking] a lot of the taxpla-, taxpayers and a
little bit more on to the medical.  Uh, I don't know if that was done out of
just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs
of the people.  You know what I'm saying?  It, it's, right now every little
state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health, uh,
system [child] and, of course, they think, uh, Wisconsin, our neigh-, or
Minnesota, our neighbor, passed a state law, the health bill and it's kind of
like we're the first to do it.  So, I don't know if it's done because we're,
we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether
it was done for, uh, you know, a real good purpose to help people that can't
afford, uh, health insurance, that #kind of thing.#

B.10:  #Right.# Well, I, I think the, one of the biggest problems that, uh, we see
in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  #Oh, sure.#

B.12:  #And that# is, uh, uh, we become so debt ridden and credit oriented --

A.13:  Oh, sure.

B.14:  -- instead of, uh, cash and carry or debt free --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and therefore, uh, that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities,
state and federal governments.

A.17:  It, it sure does.  #And# --

B.18:  #(( )).#

A.19:  -- I think it, it is reflecting.  Like you said I think society as a whole,
uh, you can't expect, uh, when we have T V -s and we have things that are kind
of bombarded at us for, uh, you know, immorality and this and this and this,
that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean, totally
clean [laughter].

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  And come into government.  Uh, but down the line it does hurt.  I mean when
somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something, it's, uh, you know, it does
hurt t-, each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done
something or the overdraft policy or, you know, the other things that have
occurred, [static] so, uh,

B.22:  Well, what is, see the thing is, is when a lot of things become acceptable
practice --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- uh, it's hard to discern the bor-, what has become muddy as to what is
ethical and what is not ethical.  #And then# --

A.25:  #Exactly.#

B.26:  -- someone blows the whistle and says, oh, this is not ethical and yes I
did it too.

A.27:  Yeah #[laughter].#  

B.28:  #[Laughter].#

A.29:  Well, that's exactly what happens in government [laughter] all the time.
They blow the whistle on each other.  Oh, I hear that you're doing this, I've
done it but oh boy, [laughter] and it's not going to get out.  Ex-, yeah, e-,
exactly.  It's, uh, #there's no# --

B.30:  #Yeah, we just had,# 

A.31:  -- secrets in the government.  #Uh# --

B.32:  #Uh.#

A.33:  -- I don't think anymore.

B.34:  Right.  The mayor of Dallas is, uh, Bartlett, #Steve Bartlett.#

A.35:  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  He also, uh, was a congressman.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  Uh, to the, uh, to Congress.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And he had been in that position for years.  

A.41:  Sure.

B.42:  And, uh, he was elected mayor of Dallas --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- overwhelmingly.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  However, if the vote was taken today, the whole thing might change because
he was part of that, uh, check kiting scam [/breathing].

A.47:  Oh, sure.  I think, I, I don't think, uh [/static] [/talking],
