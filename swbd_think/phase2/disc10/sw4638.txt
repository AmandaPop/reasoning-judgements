REMARKS:        There is a lot of noise and talking on A's side and B talks 
very low and has line noise on his phone.

============================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] [talking] Well, do you have any good ideas about this problem?

B.2:  Well, I, I live in Fort Lauderdale now, which is, of course, very close to
Miami.

A.3:  Right.

B.4:  In fact, my fiance works in Miami, uh, downtown quite a bit.  So crime's a
definite concern.  Also before this, I was in Boston where the crime rate is
also fairly high.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Uh, so it, it's definitely a concern.  Something that needs to be worked.
I know that it affects my everyday life in that, uh, you know my fiance is
very paranoid about making sure everything's locked.

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  Uh, you know, it also concerns me because I have a convertible and, uh, you
know, there is certain areas around here where I would be afraid to drive with
my top down.

A.9:  Yeah.  Well, I ha-, have the same thing [laughter].  And I understand
because I live very close to Dallas.  So, we have quite a crime rate too.  But
I'm not real sure what to do.  Recently it's been kind of a topic at work and,
uh, I just kind of feel that there's a lot of people in jail for crimes that
are not really against the person.  And I think maybe we need to find another
way to punish those people and put the real criminals in jail where they
really can't do any harm and not let them out on parole in six months or three
years or whatever and put them to work doing something useful.  Where they
don't just eat up our tax dollars.

B.10:  Sure.

A.11:  And that's kind of what we've come up with [laughter].  But I don't know.
What are your feelings about that?

B.12:  Well, I mean, yeah, except th-, the problem with that, of course, is
defining what, what's a real crime then, you know #wha-, what's a crime that
counts.#

A.13:  #Right.  Well a dangerous thing,# you know.  Where you will get hurt if
they're out on the streets.  I mean, it, I think this deal of Leona Helmsley
has just kind of brought this all home and that's what kind of sparked the
discussion was that this is a sevent-, seventy-two year old lady going to go
use up tax dollars in jail.  And I just, I just have a real problem with that.
I think there's another way to deal with that, other than put this lady in
jail to set an example.

B.14:  But putting it that way, that is kind of ironic that she'd be using up tax
dollars but --

A.15:  That's right.

B.16:  -- uh, [laughter].

A.17:  You know, that really is true.

B.18:  Sure.  Uh, however, some of the crimes that people ought to be locked up
for are, uh, are, uh, not even things that would be major crimes but they
would still be dangerous.  For example, uh, drunken driving.

A.19:  Well, that's true.  #Well that# --

B.20:  #But,# 

A.21:  -- is a potential danger though.  You're right about that but, uh, #traffic
tickets# --

B.22:  #You know, but,# 

A.23:  -- things like that.  I mean I've known of people just to be picked up
because they didn't pay their traffic tickets and I, I say yeah fine them
extra, do whatever but to go ahead and put them in jail, it costs us money
when they do that.  So, I don't know, I just have a problem with overcrowded
jails on crimes that nobody is really going to get hurt.  Uh, financially
maybe an-, and things like that.  And yes it has to be dealt with but I'm not
sure that's the way.

B.24:  Well, tha-, that is true that the, uh, amount of, uh, you know, it, it is
true that, uh, you know, jail as a concept, at least, is not working in some
cases.

A.25:  Yeah.  

B.26:  You know, #uh,# 

A.27:  #Yeah# {very faint}. And also, I think that they can get off on too many
technicalities.  I think that it turns out sometimes that the victims are the
ones that have to defend themselves rather than the criminals and I think
that's another thing that needs to be addressed too.  #I don't think# --

B.28:  #[Noise] I, I think, uh, (( )),# 

A.29:  -- you have mu-, many rights as a victim.  

B.30:  Sure.  I, I think it's very sad, however, uh, you know, I, I can see some
of that in that, and I still don't necessarily agree with that but, I mean,
tha-, the thing is that, uh, you know, we're talking about affecting
someone's, you know, livelihood, sometimes their life even on some of the more
heinous crimes.

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  And, uh, uh, it's a --

A.33:  Okay {talking to someone in background}.

B.34:  -- you know, yo-, according to the system we've got, they're presumed
innocent or get another trial.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  You know, so, yeah, they, they do have to do some of that stuff although I
do agree with you it's, that's another thing that's not quite right.

A.37:  Yeah, I think so and, I don't know, I, I've been thru a two year divorce
recently and I find that the system sucks to put it bluntly and so, you know,
[laughter] I just, I don't have a lot of respect anymore for what I thought,
you know, would be fair.  You just figure oh, well, the judge will be fair.
Well, forget it [laughter].  You know, it's no-, it doesn't happen.  They're
in a hurry, their docket is full.  They want you in, they want you out.

B.38:  Sure.

A.39:  And that's the way it is and #so,# 

B.40:  #My fiance's# a lawyer so I definitely understand that.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.42:  Uh, course in Florida, the judges are elected so that not only are they not
fair, they try to be popular at times.

A.43:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.44:  Which is not necessarily right.

A.45:  So I don't know, but I don't know how you and I can solve this so, that's
the problem, you know.  We all have ideas but nothing seems to change and I'm
not sure how it can [/noise] [/talking].

B.46:  Well, uh, I, I think,
