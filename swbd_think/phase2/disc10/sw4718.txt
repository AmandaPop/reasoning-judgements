was very hard to hear the conversation.

============================================================================

A.1:  #Okay.  Wel-,#

B.2:  #[Talking] {loudly} So, I'm sorry.#

A.3:  Go ahead [laughter].

B.4:  Wha-, what kind of benefit, benefits do you have at work?

A.5:  Well, uh, I'm, I work at a large company and, uh, we have quite a, quite a
few benefits.

@B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And, uh, we have, uh, the best benefit I like is the, uh, amount of
vacation time --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- especially after, uh, working, working there for a long time.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  It really builds up to the amount of vacation time.  I --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- I think that's one of my best benefits. 

B.14:  [TV] {sounds like a car race} Oh, yeah.  Is there something that you wish
you had that you don't?  Or,

A.15:  Well one thing that I, I, uh, wish, uh, in a big company there's more
bureaucracy and, uh, less support of, uh, what you're doing, I think --

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  -- and that something that, uh, is, uh, probably a benefit of a small
company --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- you get more support from the people that you work for.

B.20:  Yeah.  I work for a relatively small company where, a trade association for
credit unions and, uh, our benefits are fairly good.  Like you say, that
support, I mean, you work directly with the president and the executive vice
president and, you know, and they, you get the feedback from them directly and
I like that but I wish, I really d-, the thing I like, I guess I wouldn't mind
having a better retirement plan.  We have just a defined benefit plan and I
kind of would like the idea of having a Four Oh One K or something that I
could, you know, contribute to and get some matching contributions.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  That would be a lot b-, that's one thing I wish I had a little bit more of
but,

A.23:  You're really thinking of the future?

B.24:  Uh, yeah #[laughter].#  

A.25:  #[Laughter].#

B.26:  I, I don't know.  I'm kind of the type I just don't want to work my whole
life.  I'd rather build a --

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  -- make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- so that's and that's one way I can see doing it.  But, #(( )).#

A.31:  #I wor-,# I work for the state of Florida.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  And, uh, it's pretty good retirement plan.  

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Uh, we don't get paid very much but, uh, retirement plan is #pretty, pretty
good.#

B.36:  #Works good.# Yeah.  That's, like I say, ours, we're, we get, uh, vacation
is pretty good too.  I mean, it's, you get a week after the first year, two
after the second, three after the third and it goes up just every year by a
week up until, I think, like six years which is a lot better than anybody else
I'd ever heard of, uh --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- that's quite a bit of vacation to have after six years service, so.

A.39:  Did you say you worked for a credit union?

B.40:  Uh, it, it's, a, a credit union league.  They're kind of a trade
association for credit unions.

A.41:  Okay.

B.42:  We, uh, kind of do a lot of the, uh, political support and stuff like that
for the cr-, different credit unions within the state.  But {very faint},

A.43:  Yeah.  My wife used to work for a credit reunion group.

B.44:  Oh, did she?

A.45:  They ma-, they had a newsletter that went out to all the, all the, uh,
credit union C E O -s --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and people like that. 

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  So she was really into the --

B.50:  Oh, really.

A.51:  -- keeping up on what's going on #with the credit unions.#

B.52:  #Huh.  What, what did she# work for?

A.53:  Uh, it was, it was a company, uh, I think it was called Credit Union News
or #something.#

B.54:  #Uh-huh.#

A.55:  It was based out of, uh, I think it was Boca Raton, Florida.

B.56:  Oh, really.  Yeah, that sounds pretty familiar to me.

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  #But, uh,# 

A.59:  #It was pretty,# uh, pretty glossy --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- kind of, uh newsletter that comes out.

B.62:  Yeah.  Well, uh, do you get a, I don't know, have you heard of any people
that kind of do this, uh, the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose
what kind of benefits you get or #is that something that Florida# --

A.63:  #Uh, not too much.#

B.64:  -- does or where your work #(( ))# --

A.65:  #No.#

B.66:  -- or you pretty much just get what they give you and?

A.67:  Yeah.  Just I get what they give you, uh, that's, uh, not, not, uh, we, not
too many choices.

B.68:  Yeah.  I guess a lot of the more, uh, some of the newer companies and the
up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way.  But some people say
it ends up costing them more because whatever, you know, men and women alike,
they give them say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health
insurance and their retirement and whatever, but, and if th-, whatever they
don't use, they get in cash --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- but a lot of companies don't like to do that because they figure if you
got two people working, then one spouse might take insurance and the other
won't so it saves the company money --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- whereas this one, you know, you'd end up paying regardless.

A.73:  Yeah.  I guess,

B.74:  But, for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea.

A.75:  Yeah.  

B.76:  But, anyway, I haven't, uh, haven't got so fortunate as to get into any of
those companies yet.

@@A.77:  Yeah.  Um.

B.78:  But {very faint}.  Anyway,

A.79:  Okay.  Well,

B.80:  Well, hey, it was good talking to you.

A.81:  Okay.

B.82:  All right, see you later.

A.83:  Okay.

B.84:  Bye-bye [click] [/talking] [/TV].

A.85:  Bye [click].
