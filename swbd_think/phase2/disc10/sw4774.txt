REMARKS:        Speaker A mumbles and stutters a lot.  She was was to
understand at times.  

==========================================================================

A.1:  Been on the line for awhile.  I almost forgot what the topic [laughter]
was.

B.2:  Okay.  Uh, #based,# 

A.3:  #Uh,# but I know what it is.  

B.4:  Oh, okay.  Good.

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  [Noise] Uh, let me see.  I, I, I, I, I'm kind of, I don't, you know, I'm,
I'm kind of in the [static] middle.  I, I think it's a great idea --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- but when it comes to me, it's like, almost an insult, you know, so
[child] it's [lipsmack] I, I've come from the teaching field.

B.10:  Right.  So do #I [laughter].#

A.11:  #So,# so it's just like I don't know.  I, I guess, I guess I'd have to go
with, uh, I, I, I'd be for it.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  [Child_yelling] You know.  But, uh, you know, I, I, I don't know.  It's
just kind of a, kind of a delicate subject I guess.  But I, I, I would, I
would probably go for, for going ahead and doing it, you know.  If it's got to
be done for everyone.

B.14:  Right.  I think if it's got to be done for one person in the company, it
should be random testing, it should be for everybody.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  You know, when they answer the company, I think it'll make it a lot 
easier --

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  -- and they'd run into less problems.

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  Because, uh, I don't know, I come from the teaching field too and it sort
of, uh, [laughter] it's a pro and a con ty-, I don't know where to stand on
it.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  I'm more or less, if they told me I had to well then fine, #but# --

A.23:  #Yeah.#

B.24:  -- if, you know, if they made me then I'd probably, if I had my druthers
I'd probably say well no #[laughter] you know just this,#

A.25:  #Yeah.  You kind of# goes into your privacy and --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- you know, but I guess if they, you know, you know, there's, uh, I guess
there's some companies that aren't, that are doing it.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And it, it seems to be working out so,

B.30:  Yeah, I think it's, it's, what they're basically trying to do, I don't know
up here in Massachusetts anyhow, what they're basically trying to do is, uh,
oh gosh, uh, any people who had di-, tested positively, getting them into a
drug program.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  Or rehab program.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  And, uh, anybody who, uh, gee, is, you know, di-, doesn't accept the rehab
program then they're, more or less, getting laid off.

A.35:  [Lipsmack] See, that's hard.  

B.36:  I, I think that's really hard to because, you know, you never know.  I
don't know, it, that's a, it's really weird issue.  I'm #sort of# --

A.37:  #Yeah.#

B.38:  -- on the fence about it.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  But I, you know, that, that's what's they're coming across as ((is)) some
of the companies anyhow.  Oh, we can get you into a drug program.  But then
you wear that stigma --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- you know [laughter].  

A.43:  Yeah. 

B.44:  Where, uh, like a lot of people are saying, well I only smoked a joint last
night, I don't have any problems [laughter] #you know.#

A.45:  #Yeah.#

B.46:  Or something like that, yeah.

A.47:  Then I kind of hear it goes into like, uh, this is just something I've
heard that it kind of goes into like, uh, just your off the counter medication
that you could be taking for a cold.  That it kind of affects that too.

B.48:  Right.  Anything with an-, a, you know, if you drink a lot of caffeine 
#or,# 

A.49:  #Oh,# I didn't know that.

B.50:  Yeah, somebody was saying, telling me if you drink it in, 

A.51:  [Noise].

B.52:  you know, an awful lot of caffeine, that that can show up as a positive
test.

A.53:  Um.

B.54:  I know I'm an epileptic so I'd probably test positive #and [laughter]# --

A.55:  #Yeah.  See# things like that so, 

B.56:  -- and then I'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system,
you know [laughter].

A.57:  [Child] Yeah.

B.58:  And a lot of times, those are the things I don't like to disclose to an
employer because then they don't want to have anything #to do with you
[laughter].#

A.59:  #Right, right.  Uh-huh.#  

B.60:  You know, it's very personal.  I wouldn't want to have it disclosed
#because# --

A.61:  #See that's,# 

B.62:  -- then I'd always wonder if they fired me, you know, why did you fire me
[laughter].

A.63:  Yeah.  That's where I kind of get into, cause it kind of gets into your
personal life, you know.  And --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- (( )) wha-, what's kind of next.  

B.66:  Yeah.  It, it hits me as the Orwell thing.  Big brother is watching
[laughter].

A.67:  The what?

B.68:  Orwell.

A.69:  Huh.

B.70:  And, you know, his book.  Brig, big brother is watching.

A.71:  Oh.

B.72:  You know, you're being controlled.

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  [Laughter] That type of deal and I sh-, I don't really, you know, I don't
know.  Seems awful strange [noise].  I'd hate to have to, if I had my choice
between a company that did testing and a company who didn't --

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  -- I'd probably take the company who didn't?  

A.77:  Yeah [noise].

B.78:  Because I feel there'd be more trust in the employee.

A.79:  Right.

B.80:  But I can understand why they need it with all the, you know, train
accidents and everything else.

A.81:  So do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually?  I
kind of think they will.

B.82:  I think they will too because, uh, you know, it's just going to follow.

A.83:  Yeah.

B.84:  I don't know.  I, we haven't had any of it in our school system.  #So, uh,
you know# --

A.85:  #Yeah.  We haven't either.#

B.86:  -- hopefully, we won't [laughter].

A.87:  Yeah.  But I, I, I just kind of think it's heading that way though, you
know.  It's just, [lipsmack] because it's just hitting to close to home with
the kids and stuff and I just --

B.88:  Right.

A.89:  -- I just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way.  

B.90:  Well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea-, you know, #the kids
are# --

A.91:  #Yeah.#

B.92:  -- going to be under scrutiny, it's going to be the teachers.

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  And if they can test the teachers, that gives them the full right to test
the kids.

A.95:  Right.

B.96:  And then they, you know, caught everybody.

A.97:  Yeah [/static].
