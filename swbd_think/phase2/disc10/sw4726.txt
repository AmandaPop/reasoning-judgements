==========================================================================

A.1:  I'm ready if you are.

@B.2:  Okay.  Um, wh-, where do you stand, uh, on,

A.3:  Well, I think that people should be allowed to have them.  #Especially# --

B.4:  #Oh.#

A.5:  -- if they go hunting, which my son goes hunting.  He goes deer hunting.
He goes duck hunting.  Uh, he's read books about guns since he was --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- like probably eleven or twelve years old.  

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  And I just think that, uh, as far as that's concerned, he should be able to
have them to go hunting with, you know.  #As far as# --

B.10:  #Right, right.#

A.11:  -- just having handguns around to, to have them, I don't believe that you
should have handguns around.

B.12:  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I agree too.  I, uh, it's, it's, as far as the
ban goes and everything, I don't think it's possible, uh, to completely ban
guns.  There's just too many.

A.13:  Well, no.  There's too many sports people out there that, that do do these
things.

B.14:  Right, and I, yeah, right, I mean, yeah, that, that's true.  And I mean
the, the technology's not that hard.  I mean, you could make a gun, you know,
from simple, you know, #you know.#

A.15:  #Yeah, well I# suppose you could.  Uh,

B.16:  You know, if, if you really wanted a gun, you, you could make one. Uh,

A.17:  Uh-huh.  And I think if they want one, they're going to get one.

B.18:  [Cough] [throat_clearing]  #Oh, you know# --

A.19:  #You know.#

B.20:  -- true.  #That's true.#    

A.21:  #The bad# guys are, you know, like I say, if they want a gun they're going
to find out --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- somehow to get one.

B.24:  Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, I mean, yeah there's, there's no way to stop, uh,
stop anybody from getting a gun.  Uh, [dishes] I think there should be more
control as, like, uh, like maybe waiting periods and things like that, you
know, uh,

A.25:  Well I agree with you on that because I know, uh, in fact I had bought my
son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  And for a rifle there's no waiting.  There wasn't anyhow.  Now there might
be now.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  But --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- there wasn't anything for, you know, rifles and things like that.  I
#guess# --

B.32:  #Sure.#

A.33:  -- it was just handguns that there was a, #some kind# --

B.34:  #Yeah.#

A.35:  -- of a waiting, you know, two weeks while they checked you out or
something.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  But, uh, most of these people that's got these guns that's going around,
you know, robbing people and shooting people,

B.38:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh, I, I know my friend is, uh, really into guns and, uh,
uh, w-, I went a couple of times with him to gun shows, you know, #that# --

A.39:  #Uh-huh.#

B.40:  -- come through town and everything and, I mean, they just have, I mean
they have anything you'd want, #I mean# --

A.41:  #Uh-huh.#

B.42:  -- you know, you know, anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and
[breathing] there's, I mean, there's nothing.  You can just go buy one and
take it home and it's easier than getting a, like a video membership card at,
you know, a video store.

A.43:  I, see now, I know they were having a gun show about a month ago and I was
just wondering how that did work, if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun
show.

B.44:  Uh, yeah, yeah.  You just go and, uh, buy the gun and, uh,

A.45:  There's no restriction though.  You don't have to wait or nothing then huh?

B.46:  No.  Well, except for the, the pistols and th-, I'm not sure how they do
that.  #I know they,# 

A.47:  #Yeah, I# was just curious, you know, because, uh --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- I know at, at the regular gun show, you know, gun shop --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- that you,

B.52:  [Noise].

A.53:  that you do have to wait for pistols, like #a couple# --

B.54:  #Right.#

A.55:  -- of weeks and then they check you out, then they call you up and you h-,
go pick it up.

B.56:  Yeah.  #I think that's,# 

A.57:  #Which I# think [noise] they have to do on rifles and things now too.  I
think there --

B.58:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.59:  -- is some, something like that.  Anyhow, here, out here in California, I
think there is now.

B.60:  Yeah.  #Yeah# --

A.61:  #But,# 

B.62:  -- I'm not sure, I'm not really sure but, ((what)) uh, th-, the gun laws in
P-, Pennsylvania are like.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  Now we don't have guns because --

B.64:  No.

A.65:  -- we don't go hunting or anything like that.  

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  But like I say, my son, he's, 

B.68:  [Cough] {someone in background}. 

A.69:  he's always had a, like, I think his first little rifle that we got him was
like he twelve or thirteen years old.

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  But he's always, he went to the, to the school to learn how to shoot it.
He goes to the pistol range and th-, and the rifle range to shoot them.  He
likes to go to that, uh, shotgun thing where you shoot at those, uh --

B.72:  Oh, yeah.  The skeets, you mean?

A.73:  -- yeah, right [laughter].  He likes to do that --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- you know [laughter].  #But, uh# --

B.76:  #Yeah.# 

A.77:  -- I don't know.  I think they should try to control it and everything, you
know.  But as far as just banning it completely, there, that's not going to
happen.

B.78:  I don't, yeah, I, I don't think it can happen either.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  I just don't, I don't see, and, then, I, I think, uh, hadn't thought about
this before but if you do that, if they would, uh, [breathing] uh, decide to
ban guns, it would just open up a, a market, you know, a black market for
them.

A.81:  Yeah, right, #right.#

B.82:  #And so,# you know, they, they would just, all the profits would go to, you
know,

A.83:  Now I do believe though, like in California, if a little kid gets a hold of
a gun that someone has --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- I think they're liable now for, #they# --

B.86:  #Oh, th-,#

A.87:  -- can be, you know, put in jail and everything.  The, whoever owned the
gun.

B.88:  ((Oh)), yeah, the owner's responsibility?

A.89:  You know, #now# --

B.90:  #Yeah.#

A.91:  -- when they have kids around, you'd think that they would be locking them
up or, #you know.#

B.92:  #Yeah,# yeah, you know, that's, that's true.  Uh, you know, I, I had a
friend who was a, uh, [lipsmack] [sniffing] a policeman in a, in a local
borough just a small, uh, one of the little neighborhoods, you know, one of
the small towns, uh --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- near Pittsburgh.  And, uh, she said tha-, that, that, uh, you know, he
used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but, I mean,
you know, you're, you know, people make, you know, they forget or, you know,
you know, kids get in, the way kids, the way kids are, you know, I mean, they
can, you know.

A.95:  Well they can get into almost anything anymore [laughter].

B.96:  Right.
