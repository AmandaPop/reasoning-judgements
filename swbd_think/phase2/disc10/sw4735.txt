===========================================================================

A.1:  I don't know if you feel the same but, uh, when it comes to telling kids
that they have to do, uh, two or three years of service into some kind of
community, I don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that
and say, you know, you have to do two years of community service before you
can be a citizen or, you know, in the aspect that we're telling kids that this
is what is suggested for you to do.

B.2:  Right.

A.3:  And, uh, I, as far as a high school course, I could see it as, uh, maybe a
social, uh, sociology course --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with
some kind of community type of program #and# --

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  -- [Noise] to me, that's fine to have a student do that for like four or
even a year --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter, post high
school, of community service, I, I'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for
anybody to be telling somebody they have to do.

B.10:  Um.  Well, that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school
where it be more on a voluntary basis --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- as opposed to, uh, mandatory.

A.13:  Exactly.

B.14:  Yeah.  A, yeah, I kind of agree with that.  Uh, I don't think, you know,
i-, it, they should have, they should have the same rights as anyone else --

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  -- you know.

A.17:  Right [noise] [child_talking].

B.18:  It shouldn't be, uh, anything shouldn't be mandatory, other than, I guess,
like, uh, when you come to paying taxes or something like that.  Uh, or if
it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- uh, people be more eager {mispronounced} to do it.

A.21:  [/Noise] Exactly.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And doing it for a purpose that they want.  The other thing is this, I have
thought about this on many times when you get these, uh, young troubled
teenagers that, uh, don't have like the perspective of, uh, uh, of the
community, a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have
problems but there are other people out in the community that may have
problems.  Then I can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing.  You
have to do so much [noise] as #far as in# --

B.24:  #Right.#

A.25:  -- community service now.  If they were, you know, th-, abusive [noise]
type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of
abuse.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Or if, uh, they destroyed some property around the, uh, area, then they
would have to do, uh, to restore it and perhaps, uh, work, uh, for the
community to beautify it or whatever but --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- I could see that working in [noise], you know, cases where it might be
young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a
whole community that is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or
[noise] whatever.  And that's, I think they have done that and judges have
said well, you know, this is what you're going to get for [noise] a, you know,
a misd-, misdemeanor or something, you may end up having to do some kind of
community service so I could see that as something that might occur in the
court system for those that are troubled, so [noise],

B.30:  Uh-huh.  Uh, that's a good idea.  Uh, I think they should have more
programs like that.

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  And I think, uh, us being taxpayers, we pay for, uh, people that's in jail
or --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- in trouble anyway.

A.35:  Sure.  We sure #do.#  

B.36:  #So# they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize
those forms in different areas [swallowing].

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  #And# --

A.39:  #Yeah.# 

B.40:  -- I, I agree wholeheartedly.

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  Yeah.  But, uh, the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff
going on, uh --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- because like you say, is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- so why have someone in year-, jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor.
And sometimes, you know, putting them in jail doesn't really help --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- because there's nothing in there that would reb-, rehabilitate #re-,# --

A.49:  #Exactly.#

B.50:  -- #rehabilitate {mispronounced}# --

A.51:  #Yeah.#

B.52:  -- rehabilitate them --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- and then when they get out, they, because they have this stigmatism of
being in jail.

A.55:  And there's a lot of anger, sure.  You know, especially if they haven't
went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the, uh, system of
prisons which, uh, you, you always deal with somebody that's a little bit
worse than yourself [laughter] next to you or whatever.  I would say the
crimes would probably be, you know, if you went in for a certain crime, there
might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have, so you're
dealing with people, uh, that may, uh, be an influence later on and, uh, an
issue of anger would be is that I went to prison for a year or two but I
didn't get any rehabilitation --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- or, uh, you know.  But then again, those that have physically assaulted
somebody, uh, that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program
#out in# --

B.58:  #Uh-huh.#

A.59:  -- the community if they're of a violent sort and to say [/child_talking],

B.60:  Right.
