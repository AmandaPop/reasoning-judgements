===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay [children_yelling].  Uh, I just currently quit my job and so
[laughter] I really don't receive any benefits right now #[laughter].#

@B.2:  #[Static] [laughter] Right [sniffing].#

A.3:  But my husband does and, uh, I think one of the, uh, my, first of all,
always salary and se-, the second thing is, uh, because we have children, so
it would be, [hum] uh, health benefits and medical benefits and --

B.4:  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  

A.5:  -- and, uh, right now we have probably some excellent benefits right now.
We have with Aetna and, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with them but
we're real happy with them.

B.6:  Yeah.  Yeah, I've had a variety of different jobs with a various types, uh,
in the computer field.  And so I've seen a variety of types of benefits.  Uh,
I've worked for, for (( )) for awhile and they are, you know, a really
academic type of place.  And then I've worked with regular, you know, industry
type places.  And then with others that are kind of half way between and
stuff.  So I've seen a wide range of both, you know, nonsalary type benefits
and other stuff, you know, like health care that's either fully or partially
paid and, you know, some have like bonuses and others have had lots of
vacation time but not much other types of benefits and --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- so, yeah, I ((would)) I'd say health care is way up there, especially
anybody with kids.  Uh --

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- and that's one of the big things that we always look at, you know.  When
we, when I think about t-, changing jobs is, you know, you know, what kind of
health care they have and does the company pay for it.  You know, all or
partially or how does that work.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  And, uh, also, uh, vacation time too is a, is a big #one for me.#

A.13:  #[Lipsmack] Yeah.#  Yeah.

B.14:  Uh, and I guess support for whatever, whatever other, 

A.15:  [Lipsmack].

B.16:  you know, kinds of professional activities you have at, you know, work.

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  Uh, #cause I've# --

A.19:  #Huh.#

B.20:  -- been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer
any #and# --

A.21:  #Right.#

B.22:  -- some that, sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more
vacation time though, so that's not so bad, you know.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  You know, it's kind of a give and take kind of thing, I think.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Uh, I say that health care is probably definitely number one though.  (( ))
want to just, you know, all your salary can't [laughter] even #begin# --

A.27:  #Yeah.#

B.28:  -- to pay for what you can wind up losing, you know --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- in a major illness or something.  Uh.

A.31:  Right.  Uh, and, and, and another good thing is with the health benefits
when they give you more than two choices [laughter] on who to go with.

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  And that really helped us out a great deal.  So.  But my husband does get
vacation and it's worked out really good for us too.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  So [cough] [throat_clearing].  But.

B.36:  Yeah.  Flexible hours are, are pretty important to me as well.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Uh, cause that makes a big difference.  My wife works part-time.

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  And she works, uh, as a assistant manager in a fabric store.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And so she works a lot of evenings and weekends and so two days a week, I,
uh, manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus [clicking].  So
she wor-, you know, goes in early those days and works like, you know, noon
til close.  Uh, so we have #(( )) [clicking].#

A.43:  #Well,# that's great that you all can work that out.  #That's really good.#

B.44:  #Yeah, and being# on a, you know, [clicking] rigid schedule wouldn't, there
wouldn't be anyway to do that at all.

A.45:  Right.

B.46:  And I think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the
kids occasionally too.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  I mean usually, you know, you go to work before they're awake or as they're
getting, [clicking] up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless
it's summer time, you know.  And even in summer time, sometimes you get home
so late that there's, you know, you can't do anything with them.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  And especially in the winter.  I mean, you g-, get up in the dark and come
home in the dark [laughter] you know.  It's like, it's like a vampire
((sometimes)) #[laughter].#

A.51:  #[Laughter]# Yeah.  It's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty
flexible hours if, as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do (( )).

B.52:  [Talking].  

A.53:  Worked out really well for us too.

B.54:  [Talking] Yeah.  

A.55:  Uh.  Well is there anything else that you look for or,

B.56:  [Clicking] Uh, #a lot of (( )) I guess is.#

A.57:  #You've hit pretty,# you've put a lot of the main points in.

B.58:  Yeah.  I think some of, is how the, uh, you know, I guess it's not really a
direct benefit but how your, uh, performance is rated and stuff like that at
work.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  Cause I've been, uh, especially in large corporations.  You can really, you
know, wind up getting, having, you know, real problems I've found out.  I've
worked for a few, you know, several thousand plus, [clicking] you know, type
companies.

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  And it, and especially if you're doing like professional work.  Where i-,
you know, it's kind of [clicking] [child_talking] ((ethereal)) as to what
you're doing --

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- you know.  If you're, like I've, I work with, uh, computer systems a
lot.  So it's kind of hard to say, you know.  If you're, you know, a brick
layer, somebody can look and see, you know, well, yeah, you laid, you know,
fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building
didn't fall down, you know [clicking].  Yeah, you did a great job.  But if you
build computer systems, like, well, you know, what does that computer program
really do, you know.  Or, especially if you write like papers, #you know.#

A.65:  #Uh-huh.#

B.66:  Or do design studies or something.  It's real hard to rate something like
that.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  It's like get a painter, you know, or something, a artist.  It's like well
(( )) you, how do you really rate, you know, Michelangelo, you know
[clicking].  How would you tell if he was, you know, really good or so-so or
whatever [/static].

A.69:  Yeah.  And that does make a wan-, a person want to stay [/children_yelling]
[/hum],
