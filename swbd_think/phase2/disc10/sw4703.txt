A.1:  [Clicking] Okay.

B.2:  [Clicking] So, what is your opinion on, on drug testing?

@A.3:  [TV] [noise] Well I can see it in certain cases where it might be, uh,
somebody's in a position that, uh, perhaps a lot of lives are involved, like,
maybe, uh, pilots that, uh, you know, fly jets and, uh, maybe people that have
a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people.  I could certainly see it
being done but, in general, uh, you know, whether companies want to do this
and I know that companies do.  Like factory workers that have lots of
accidents are now being drug tested.  I know a couple of corporations that are
doing that.  Uh, so, you know, they kind of have gotten into the idea that
let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab.  But there's got to be
like a limitation.  Do we drug test everybody that comes in and or do we kind
of say, well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this
way.  You're, you're very conservative and, and there's just no way that we
would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the
stereotype of, uh, the conservative or whatever could be drug tested.  And,
uh, you know, whether legal rights and, of that person, I don't know.  There's
certainly a lot of things to really consider, uh, when you get into drug
testing people just at the work place unless, of course, like I said, they
have a large responsibility over a mass of people #uh, that's about it.#

B.4:  #Well, yeah,# it, it, it's just not the com-, you're talking about
company's liability.

A.5:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.6:  If, if, uh, if the company is liable for something that, that, a employee
does while under the influence of, of a drug, you know, then by all means they
should have #the right to, to, to, {pause} to# --

A.7:  #Sure, sure.  And I think that's# what companies are doing, uh, more and
more because there are products that are out there.

B.8:  -- [Noise] to minimize their liability.  And there's also the case about
just, uh, uh, health, health and welfare of the, uh, [swallowing] employees.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  If a company has a healthy work force, #their# --

A.11:  #Exactly.#

B.12:  -- insurance rates are low.

A.13:  Sure, #sure.#

B.14:  #And# not only a-, not only low, there's all sorts of a, of a benefits, uh,
financial benefits #associated# --

A.15:  #Sure.#

B.16:  -- with having, you know, having people file fewer claims, #being sick.#

A.17:  #Exactly.#  #The only thing is,# 

B.18:  #(( ))# There, there's the whole question that, that a, that a work force
that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy I #don't think
anybody# --

A.19:  #Exactly.#

B.20:  -- would argue with that.

A.21:  Exactly.  The only thing is, uh, the one issue that I would take stands
with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is
actually not on drugs and come out positive.

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  If they have had like, uh, medications in the past, let's say, once a month
or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil
and the Advil will, apparently, come out positive as if they smoked
marijuana.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  Uh, and there's poppy seed type things.  I think that everybody is aware of
that but, uh, where's the line where you, where you say to somebody, I'm going
to drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or where's,
#you know how can# --

B.26:  #Well, wel-, the ques-,#

A.27:  -- how you can do it?

B.28:  Right.  The question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests,
{mispronounced} who tests positive.

A.29:  Exactly.

B.30:  D-, that's where the real sticking point comes in.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  It's not, I don't think there's any problem with testing people.

A.33:  Sure.

B.34:  It's what do you do with the information?  

A.35:  Sure.  Exactly.  An-, and th-, the only thing that I would say on that is
it could blacklist an employee later on.  Let's say, uh, you've taken
medication of some sort, even though they usually have you, at the time, list
what medications you've taken.  Uh, let's say you do come out positive and
you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there.  Or you've had a
cold and you've been on medication or whatever, you come out positive.  Is it
then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative
fashion and say well, you know, this is kind of iffy, you know, are they
really on drugs or, or they on drugs, you know what I'm saying.  #Where# --

B.36:  #Right.#

A.37:  -- there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person,
uh, is on drugs or make up, they may make up their mind that let's get rid of
this employee, you know #what I'm# --

B.38:  #Right.#

A.39:  -- saying?  

B.40:  Well, yeah.  I think clearly, the person who is the line own-, the line
manager --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing.
That should go to an entirely different, uh, agency within a corporation.

A.43:  Exactly.  

B.44:  #Uh,#

A.45:  #And# it's a, they can that the, if it does come out positive the first
time, they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take,
you know what I mean?  It, it's kind of like, uh, I think most people are
aware, at least now, common knowledge is that [/TV] [/noise],
