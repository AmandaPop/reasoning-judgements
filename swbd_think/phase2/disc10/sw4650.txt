=========================================================================

A.1:  You an avid magazine reader?

@B.2:  Uh, not really.  I don't really read any regularly.  #Uh# --

A.3:  #Oh [noise].#

B.4:  -- in the past I use to read some.  I use to read TIME all the time --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- but I guess I was just i-, I don't know, too much reading to do so I
stopped doing it, so.

A.7:  Do you read for work or something?

B.8:  Yeah, I do a lot of reading for work because I, I don't know, I just have a
lot of research literature to keep up on is the thing, so.

A.9:  Huh.  Are you in the scientific field or something?

B.10:  Yeah, I'm in computer science.  

A.11:  Oh.  Well, uh, my thoughts about magazines are, uh, that they're kind of a
quick fix.

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#

A.13:  #I# watch very little T V and I, I like to read a lot.  But if I'm feeling
jumpy, I kind of enjoy a magazine because everything is short and you can, you
know, l-, perhaps look at the pictures, read an article for a couple of pages,
you don't feel like you've committed yourself to all the time it takes to read
five hundred pages.

B.14:  Right.  #It's just# --

A.15:  #((Right)).#

B.16:  -- the thing is, I, I don't know, I just have a tendency to want to read
everything no matter what I bu-, what I buy so.

A.17:  #[Laughter] You, you're# --

B.18:  #((It's kind of weird)).#

A.19:  -- pretty thorough if you're going to it, right?

B.20:  Yeah, I don't know.  It's, uh, just a weird thing about me.  So I try not
to buy anything [laughter] that I'm afraid of reading the whole thing, so.

A.21:  Oh {faint}.  If you're in a doctor's office and they have all kinds of
stuff --

B.22:  #Yeah.#

A.23:  -- #what# are you attracted to?

B.24:  Oh, I don't know.  Uh, I, I like reading up on the news, uh, and sometimes
I like some science stuff but not much actually, so, I mean because POPULAR
SCIENCE type magazines aren't usually very, uh, #I don't know.#

A.25:  #Scientific?#

B.26:  Yeah, scientific, so.  

A.27:  [Laughter].

B.28:  How about you?  What do you read?

A.29:  Uh, well, uh, in the magazine world I guess I'm kind of, I hate to
stereotype myself because I'm not all that girlish in the sense of girlish --

B.30:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- you know, I can soldier and all of that kind of good stuff [laughter].
#But# --

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  -- in my magazines when I think about it, uh, I have a cooking magazine
that I like because I like to cook and there's som-, it's been called COUNTRY
HOME which has, uh, it's kind of a mellow thing with all kinds of Americana
and, uh, you, I don't know, recipes and decorating and all kinds of girl
stuff.

B.34:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.35:  [Laughter] You know, I li-, I'm almost embarrassed to #say that.#

B.36:  #Girl stuff# huh?  Well, it's not girl stuff, it ju-, you know, good stuff,
that's all.

A.37:  Well the other day I was talking with a fellow about woodworking and, and
that's another thing I love to do.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  I'm an artist and I'm into all kinds of crafts and things so I can, I can
saw and solder and all kinds of, you know, things that would make me not sound
like the typical, you know, cutesy, housewife type [laughter].

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  But I guess in magazines I gu-, I, you know, I'm, run the line, I suppose
that's true.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  Uh, at, we have some ROAD AND TRACK magazines around the house my oldest
son likes and I'll pick that up too.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  I enjoy it.  I like to look at the stuff I'd love to have if I had all the
money to buy it [laughter].

B.46:  Yeah.  I, I find it interesting to read just about anything that's lying
around usually.  I mean, it's always interesting.  Stuff I don't, wouldn't
normally buy, you always ju-, well I don't know, like I had an old friend who
use to read COSMOPOLITAN all the time and I thought it was the most ridiculous
magazine but it was just so interesting to find out, ((I don't know)), about
the culture of people who read COSMOPOLITAN [laughter], you know.

A.47:  It's kind of like sneaking a peek at the other side.  #I know what you
mean.#

B.48:  #Right [laughter].#

A.49:  I'm a big fan of the library.  I, you know, I, I don't really reread books
so with the price of the paperbacks and even the hardcovers going up, I just,
why not use the library.  They'll even get anything you ask them to find for
you, so --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- you know, why not do that.  But I am a big fan of the new book rack.
You walk in and they've got all the new books and to me it's like a little
treasure, opening this crispy, you know, covered brand new book.  And I'll
come home with the strangest things that,

B.52:  [Laughter].

A.53:  I never would have picked out.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  Because, you know, they run the whole Dewey Decimal System and, #you 
know,# --

B.56:  #Right.#

A.57:  -- there was one on Alpine skiing that looked interesting and one on, you
know, wood carving that looked interesting and you know, you just find these
things that, uh, [lipsmack] ((well)) it's refreshing to pick up something that
you would never go to a rack for I think.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  #But# --

B.60:  #Right.#

A.61:  -- I don't know that I have that much more to say about wood car-,
[laughter],

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  about wood carving, I'm not even speaking, thinking straight here, about
magazines.  Uh, any other thoughts on your part?

B.64:  Uh, not in particular, no [laughter].  #Uh,#

A.65:  #Um.#

B.66:  S-, do you re-, you're an artist then?   

A.67:  #Yeah.#

B.68:  #So,# do you read a lot of art magazines at all or,

A.69:  Uh, there are some.  Um, I'm particularly interested in the crafts and
there is one called AMERICAN CRAFT --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- that lists all the shows and that kind of thing and, uh, craft shows are
a lot of fun to go to when it's not some, some housewife in quotes who put
lace on a pair of sox and sells that #as a craft.  I mean,# 

B.72:  #[Laughter].#

A.73:  that makes me crazy #[laughter].#

B.74:  #[Laughter].#

A.75:  You know, but if it's really truly beautiful pottery and, and, you know,
hand hewn wood [laughter] and stuff like that --

B.76:  #Yeah.#

A.77:  -- #then# I really enjoy it.  An-, and I'm going to start taking up some
pottery, which I've never done myself.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  I've gone from woodworking to silver jewelry making to stain glass and
pottery, turning clay on a wheel is something I've never done and I just
discovered,
