==========================================================================

A.1:  What do you think?  [noise].

B.2:  Well, uh, I can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty
years ago, uh, [swallowing] because I'm not that old yet.

A.3:  [/Noise] Uh-huh.

B.4:  Um #[laughter].#

A.5:  #I can be,# but go ahead #[laughter].#

B.6:  #[Laughter]# Uh, I know that, uh, I mean obviously you look at, at
technologic-, the technological aspect of, of social change.  I mean you
didn't have, uh, you didn't have video games.  You didn't have home computers.
You didn't have Xerox machines.

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  I mean, uh, you, you try to, you go into a, a business today and, you, you
try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper and it's
almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and, and everything have
become such, you know, su-, such a, a par-, a part of the way we live.

A.9:  Right.  #We fax# --

B.10:  #And (( )),# 

A.11:  -- everything.  

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  We don't even wait for the mail anymore.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  Yeah, uh, a business associate of mine was, was talking about how it used
to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do
something, this was concerning the S E C, and so if they had business to do,
they had to finish it, you know, three days in advance so they could get it
through the mail.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  And now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Because you can get it there, you know --

A.21:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.22:  -- in, in a matter of minutes --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- you know, through a fax machine and because of that, these quote,
unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that
much harder.

A.25:  Right.

B.26:  Because you're expected to work on #stuff up until the last minute.#

A.27:  #You're expected to,# exactly.  And I recently read an article on just
this, that said stress today is so much worse [talking].  It should be less
because [noise] we have a microwave and our grandmothers had to bake brownies
and we can throw them in a microwave for [/talking] two minutes but the more
conveniences we have, the more that's expected of us --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and we have no down time.  Like we don't stop and wait for things to
happen because we don't have to.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  So we keep moving.  We don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this
to happen and that to happen.  We just hit buttons and keep going to the next
thing.  So we have no [talking] relaxation time in between --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- so they say that's really a bad thing.  That you need to learn a lot of
ways to, to deal with that and get your, [noise] your time in between things.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  So that's good.  That's an interesting point.  But I just think our, our
family lives have changed [noise] drastically.

B.36:  [Laughter].

A.37:  And I think that's ju-, of course a part of it is technology.  I mean our
kids, where would they be without Nintendo and, you know, their T V shows and
no-, some of that is really bad I think.  But, we have all single families.
So many single families now.  Uh, a lot of working, both parents are working.
So there's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's
friends really are on their original mother and father.  You know, I'm
wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years.

B.38:  Well, there's that and there's the fact that, you know, nowadays fewer and
fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen.  I
mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't
for the fact that we,

A.39:  [Talking].

B.40:  have continuation, large scale immigration into the country.

A.41:  You're probably right [/talking].  And I'm an O B nurse and that's never
really occurred to me but that's, that's interesting.  I never really thought
about it that way.

B.42:  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that, the numbers on that awhile back and I was like,
uh-huh [laughter] so {very faint}.

A.43:  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.  ((When)) is this good or not good.  

B.44:  Well, uh,

A.45:  We don't know that yet [laughter].

B.46:  In terms of the long term effect, effect on, on America, in terms of the
culture and everything, I don't know.  #Uh,# 

A.47:  #Yeah.#  I don't know either.

B.48:  Most of the, of the next generation is going to be in, or, or an, ex-,

A.49:  [Noise].

B.50:  ex-, extremely large par-, part of the next generation is going to be, you
know, second generation, f-, uh, from immigrant parents.

A.51:  #That's true.#

B.52:  #And they're# going to be really struggling and I don't think that America
is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is
necessarily considered to be good #[laughter].#

A.53:  #Right,# right.

B.54:  I mean, it's no longer the, the, uh, the accomplishment that it, that it
once was and not that many people are really trying I don't think
[swallowing].

A.55:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's kind of scary.  Huh.  Well that's true.  But, I, it's
just very, very different and I guess every ten years it's just been very
different.

B.56:  Yeah {very faint}.  

A.57:  So.  And I don't know what's going to happen.  Uh, I know what I'm seeing
here at m-, my job [talking] is that people are having their children much
later in life --

B.58:  Yeah, #tha-,#

A.59:  -- #so# that they're establishing careers and they've got their homes and
they've got,
