===========================================================================

B.1:  Actually, I'm in, like I said, I'm in Minneapolis and the big thing up
here, of course, is the twins.  #Uh,#

A.2:  #I# imagine you can't escape it [laughter].

B.3:  No, it's, it's pretty pervasive.  It kind of goes [laughter] into about all
aspects of society I think up here.  But, uh, actually, I don't know how much
of the World Series you caught last year, but that was a lot of fun (( )).

@A.4:  Well, of course, it was fun for you [laughter].

B.5:  [Laughter] Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.  In
fact, I've only been up here a few months and I'm going back at the end of
next month.

A.6:  To?

B.7:  Uh, Orlando, Florida.

A.8:  Oh, really.

B.9:  So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.  But,

A.10:  I was born and raised in, uh, near Miami and, uh, #spent the# --

B.11:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.12:  -- last twenty years in Dallas --

B.13:  Oh.

A.14:  -- uh, where the Rangers played.

B.15:  Uh-huh.

A.16:  And, uh, #for the# --

B.17:  #(( )).#

A.18:  -- last, uh, what, year, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where
there are two teams.  The Oakland A -s and the San Francisco Giants.

B.19:  Right.

A.20:  Uh, but honestly, you know, I, uh, I do my duty and watch the sports #on,
uh,#

B.21:  #[Laughter].#

A.22:  the newscasts --

B.23:  Oh, okay.

A.24:  -- but that's about all the exposure I have to sports.

B.25:  Yeah, I haven't followed it real closely at all.  Uh, except like I said,
last year when the World Series rolled around, I did, I did follow that
pretty religiously.  Went out into the bars, you know --

A.26:  Uh-huh [noise] {sounds like a train}.

B.27:  -- drank a beer, watched the game, had a gir-, a good time that way.

A.28:  Oh, yeah, sure.

B.29:  #But, uh,# 

A.30:  #Well, I# guess the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s were
like the leading teams a couple of years ago.

B.31:  Is that right?

A.32:  Well, I th-, well I don't know.  That's sort of what I gather.

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  Um, and, uh, I don't know.  What is the prognosis for, uh, this year?

B.35:  Uh, real good as far as I can tell.  People #are pretty excited about it.#

A.36:  #Good.  I, I# assume that means good for the Minnesota [/noise],

B.37:  Well yeah #[laughter].#   

A.38:  #[Laughter].#

B.39:  Sorry about that, yeah.  Uh, as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to
be real good.

A.40:  [Static]. 

B.41:  Uh, my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of
nights ago and they, they won that one seven to one, so, uh, that's pretty
good I guess.  It looks like they'll be doing pretty well.  Are you still
there?

A.42:  Yep [/static].  

B.43:  Okay.  I heard some noise on the line.  Didn't know what happened.

A.44:  I think a train went by.  

B.45:  Oh, okay.  All #right.#

A.46:  #I# know a train went by, I don't know what the noise was but I think it
probably was the, the train.

B.47:  Yeah.

A.48:  Well, I don't know.  I, I, I don't even know, uh, who has been winning in,
uh, as far as the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A -s but I think
they both won their opener.  I, uh, sort of gathered that in my, uh, subliminal
memory.

B.49:  Uh-huh [laughter].  Well maybe that has, has good tidings for their, uh,
for their season coming up.  I've actually got a friend that's living in San
Francisco right now.  Uh, he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is,
basically, uh, an internship.  We, we're both doctoral students and #he's# --

A.50:  #Huh.#

B.51:  -- doing his with I B M and I'm doing mine with Honeywell.  But, uh, I, I
think he kind of follows the sports and I think he's mentioned [noise] uh,
the Oakland A -s a couple of times.  #Uh# --

A.52:  #Uh-huh.#

B.53:  -- he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good.

A.54:  I guess they are different leagues.  Is that right?  The #A -s?#

B.55:  #As far# as I know, yeah.  

A.56:  #((Yeah)).#

B.57:  #And# in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different
divisions and then, of course, there's the minors.  Uh, I don't know.  I, I
guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I
could really probably get into baseball.

A.58:  Uh-huh.

B.59:  Uh, but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after
that game, and he offered, you know, to take me to one of the games because,
apparently, he'd bought, uh, he and four other people from Honeywell had
bought a seat, or a row of seats actually, #for the home games.#

A.60:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.61:  But the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year.  So there's
no, no way that you can ever use them all.

A.62:  Eighty-six?

B.63:  Eighty-six.  I was amazed to hear that.

A.64:  Huh!

B.65:  You know, that's just the home games and I, I thought it was a mistake but
he goes no #(( )).#

A.66:  #Well they# must play every day then.  

B.67:  Yeah.  Well just about, yeah.

A.68:  I mean eighty-six times two --

B.69:  Yeah.

A.70:  -- is a hundred sixty.

B.71:  And that's, you know, yeah #that's almost,# 

A.72:  #And that's,# Lord, that's, uh, over five months worth.

B.73:  That's a lot of baseball.

A.74:  Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth.

B.75:  Well, you, yo-, if you, if you consider it, the season starts, well it's,
the season started about a week and a half ago and it ends with the World
Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January.

A.76:  No.  

B.77:  Yeah, I think so.  It did last we-, year, didn't it?  Or was it #November?#

A.78:  #That# was the Super Bowl.

B.79:  Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.  I know it was doggone cold up
here.  Uh,

A.80:  I don't feel so bad.  I think you, you don't know all that much more than I
do about baseball #[laughter].#

B.81:  #Well, I know# for sure it was, I know it was after September.  

A.82:  [Sigh].

B.83:  Because that's when I got up here.

A.84:  I see, #okay.#

B.85:  #And,# and it was at least two months after I got up here.

A.86:  Oh, really, okay #(( )).#

B.87:  #Yeah,# so it had to be November anyway.

A.88:  Well, I, I know, uh, the Super Bowl,
