===============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials.  I, you know, I, I really feel as
though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used
historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only
kinds of things that you can use.  Because the, the jurisprudence is, you
know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law.  And if, if
you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden
they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases
that, uh, that would be handled differently #were# --

@B.2:  #[TV] (( )).#

A.3:  -- they judged by today's standards.  So I, I really don't think it, they
can really do much of anything to change it.  What do you think?  [Noise].

B.4:  [Lipsmack] Uh, I, I don't think so.  Possibly in the jury selection would
be the only,

A.5:  [Bird_squawk].

B.6:  just for example, what we're seeing in California I guess.  It makes you
wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what would have
happened with that outcome.  Uh, and th-, and the problems that, that has come
[cough] {someone in background} that has come from this decision that that
jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape
beating.  Uh [lipsmack] just makes you wonder I guess #whether or not 
they,# 

A.7:  #Well won't, well# maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff
like that but then --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- then, you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those
blows apparently #and, you know, the# --

B.10:  #That's, ((that's bad)).#

A.11:  -- other two guys sat in the car --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and they didn't get beat up.

B.14:  No.  ((It)),

A.15:  You know.  Rodney got beat up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know,
he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  And, uh, uh, [swallowing] just like the burning and looting --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- is self-destruct.  #Everybody# --

B.20:  #Oh, yes.#

A.21:  -- says well this is the nineties and they're going to rebuild and it'll be
even better.  Hey, what do you think, you know, some, some black guy with
capital is going to come in and invest in that area?

B.22:  That's right.

A.23:  With everybody with that mind set.  #They, they're# --

B.24:  #They're only going# to suffer.

A.25:  -- they're going to, that whole area is going to be turned into residential
ghetto, you know, and you might even be able to, to use it for, for a bombing
test site, you know.

B.26:  T-, they're only going to suffer.  They, they've defeated themselves with,
with their looting and violence.  Uh, I understand why they were upset by the
verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or, uh, don't live
there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape and, uh,

A.27:  Well e-, everybody is saying this is going to be a new era and we're going
to reexamine this thing.  Hey, the b-, the average person is going to take a
look at that and say, suspicions confirmed.  They're a bunch of animals, you
know.  How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose
everything.  Forty deaths.  I mean there are #forty people# --

B.28:  #I know.#

A.29:  -- that are dead as a result of that.

B.30:  Yeah, it's really ridiculous.

A.31:  And I'm just trying to determine, you know, how you address, how you weigh,
you know, Rodney getting, getting the hell beat out of him against, you know,
forty deaths.

B.32:  Against forty other people being,

A.33:  Yeah.  And there's no other, I'm not su-, exactly sure, uh, what the
circumstances surrounding the deaths.  And I'm very upset that the news media
has not identified those deaths --

B.34:  Those deaths.

A.35:  -- and, and pursued it, you know, because I'm interested in the
circumstances surrounding #this thing.#

B.36:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.37:  Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner?  #I, you know, no tears.#

B.38:  #Or just a by-,# an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to
death or what.

A.39:  Yeah.  #And# -- 

B.40:  #Um.#

A.41:  -- and so I, but I, 

B.42:  [Noise].

A.43:  I suspect a number of them.  You know, you, you see film of people being
pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in, in the street.

B.44:  (( )) Or, or beaten.

A.45:  And, and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before, rather
than stop.  And, uh, and there, there would have been just nothing but carnage
after, after, after --

B.46:  Um {very, very faint}.

A.47:  -- if I'd been at the wheel.  #No one# --

B.48:  #Right.#

A.49:  -- would have stopped me.  

B.50:  That's, that's exactly how I feel too. I wouldn't have, uh, they wouldn't
have stopped my car for any, anything had I seen them coming.  But I was just
wondering since you're, you're in, you're back east, uh, and a little closer
to the, the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here.

@@A.51:  Right.  I'm inside the beltway.

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  You know how capital gang, they always say well inside the beltway, they
think thus and so and I say well wait a minute, I'm inside the beltway and I
don't think like that.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  I'm a government employee.

B.56:  Oh.  In what, uh, section of the government #do you work?#  

A.57:  #I'm with# the F B I.

B.58:  Oh [laughter].  Oh, that's interesting [laughter].

A.59:  Yes.  An-, and so, uh, uh, and, and the reason I'm doing this whole thing
is because Rick,

B.60:  [Talking].

A.61:  whose another government employee wanted a spe-, segments of my speech,

B.62:  [Noise].

A.63:  that --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- that were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later.

B.66:  Oh.

A.67:  And so this is my seventh call.  A year ago I did eleven calls.  

B.68:  Oh, I see [/TV].

A.69:  And so that's, that's why, uh, [swallowing] uh, that's why I'm religiously
getting on the phone because I have a unique, you know, I have a unique
situation here in that if I don't participate,
