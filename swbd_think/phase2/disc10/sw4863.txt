==========================================================================

B.1:  We're supposed to talk about if we agree on, if we're paying too many taxes
or if we're getting our monies worth out of the taxes we pay.

@A.2:  Right.  I think it's kind of a loaded question.  I don't think anybody
would say we should pay more [laughter]. I think --

B.3:  No.

A.4:  -- I think that most of us feel that we do pay enough.

B.5:  Yeah.  I think, here in Texas they're even running an a, a series right
now on the news, one of the news channels at night about, they were like
secretly, uh, supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county
here.

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  And they were hired by the state so they were being paid with our tax 
money --

A.8:  Right.

B.9:  -- and they weren't even doing the job.  They were out working on other
sites, not doing a thing on what they were supposed to do.

A.10:  Well, I, I think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs,
people feel that once they get them, they're entitled to them for life and
they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions,
etcetera. 

B.11:  Right.

A.12:  Uh, during my college years, my mom worked for the state and she got me a
summer job and when I came in I was just a little eager beaver and I went
through whatever work they gave me and I found people sitting around me
polishing their nails and they were downright disgusted with me because I was
going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didn't like
me, you know, showing them up and finishing stuff.  So what they did was give
me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do so I would just back off.

B.13:  Right.

A.14:  And, you know, that's what it seemed like from the inside.  Uh, it's not
that no one works.  I think what happens is it's a personality thing and those
who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four
freeloaders --

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  -- who don't do it.  I, I, you know, I think it's a cross section of
humanity.  It's not so much,

B.17:  [Throat_clearing].

A.18:  all state workers.  I mean it's hard to generalize like that.

B.19:  Yeah, I think that we pay enough taxes and I think that if, if everybody
would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money, if we could somehow
get the same, uh, ability to get work done an-, and be honest about it with
our tax dollars I don't think they'd need to raise it and I think they'd be
able to handle with what we've got.  I feel like, here in Texas, we pretty
much get our monies back,

A.20:  [Clicking].

B.21:  out of what we pay.  I feel very pleased with what they do.  They've put
in, you know, as far as the state taxes go, I don't know about our federal
money.  I think that's all pretty, [laughter] I hope that they're doing better
with not spending so much more than what they've got but, you know, you just
never, you can't control that.  But in the state here, they've put in bike
trails.  They've got really nice parks here in Texas.  They keep their, their
their lots that they own that are green and stuff, they keep them really nice.
Uh, their schools here are really good and updated.  They've got computers in
the schools.  I'm very pleased, at least with the area that we're in, with how
they spend their money.  Their, their, they don't tax us outrageously and they
seem to really give us a lot for our tax dollars.  They offer community
classes for our kids to go to that are just very mis-, minimal costs, you
know, just cover the instructor.

A.22:  Huh.

B.23:  And, uh, there is lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of.
There are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing.
Uh, they just offer so much for, I feel like, what we pay in our taxes that I
don't mind paying them at all.

A.24:  [Noise] Apparently, there's been a, uh, movement where I am.  I'm on Long
Island, which is a suburb of New York City, and, uh, there's been a movement
by homeowners to try to get their, their home taxes reduced.  They feel
they're too high.  And there's all kinds of review boards that, if you feel
strongly about it, you can challenge your tax.  Uh, the newspaper's now
running an article on state universities.  #Which# --

B.25:  #Uh-huh.#

A.26:  -- you know, everyone kind of as-, at least I did, assumed that you can get
a good education and pay so much less than a private university and it seems
to be more of an expos3e than anything.  H-, hearing ghastly stories about
kids who are taking four and five, like five years to graduate because when
they try to sign up for classes, so overcrowded, they can't get in the class.
#So, in order# --

B.27:  #Yeah.#

A.28:  -- to finish all the, uh, requisites, they have to just stay longer till
they can finally get a hold of the class.

B.29:  Right.

A.30:  That, this I thought was totally outrageous.  That they have teaching
assistants, well that's, that's an old thing, you know.  Having graduate
students teach undergrads but some of these people are, you know, from India
and Asia and they don't speak English well enough for the students to
understand.  Now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is
not fluent.

B.31:  Right.

A.32:  And, and I heard that that's true.  I mean, that's, I find that incredible.
#That's a,# 

B.33:  #So# you're not as pleased with your tax dollars and what they're doing in
New York?

A.34:  Uh, [sigh] yeah, well I guess I have a, a private, uh, argument with them.
I'm a substitute teacher who, you know, hav-, has raised a family.  My kids
are older now and I'd like to work full-time and they're firing teachers left
and right and the classes are getting bigger.  Our school budgets are really
down.

B.35:  Yeah.

A.36:  Maybe it's not handled real efficiently, you know.  That's, that's very
likely.

B.37:  [Laughter] That could be.  I don't know, #uh,# 

A.38:  #My,# you know, my husband's in the computer business and the schools just,
you know, they're updating, computers are the hot new thing.  And, my 
husband,
