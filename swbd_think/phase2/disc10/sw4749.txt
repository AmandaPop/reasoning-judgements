==========================================================================

A.1:  I think now we're driving a nineteen eighty-five, uh, Buick Park Avenue
that's still on the road.

B.2:  You must have a family [laughter].

A.3:  Yeah [laughter].  It's, uh, it, it's an interesting car with all sorts of
problems that crop up now that it's in it's seventh year.  

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  [Laughter] And, uh, like, anytime anything happens, it's immediately five
hundred dollar repair --

B.6:  Ooh!

A.7:  -- or what have you so, I, in looking for the next car that we get here,
we're going to look for something that has a very good track record that --

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  -- isn't going to cost us a bundle every time something goes wrong.

B.10:  Well I can tell you about reliability.  The last two cars I've had have
both been Honda Accords and, uh, I mean it's probably, it's not a hugh car but
it's been very reliable and, uh, I was just very impressed by it, uh, when I
first looked at it and when I talked to other people who had Hondas.  They
cost a little more and when I was looking for them, the dealer just wouldn't
negotiate at all because they're such a big demand.  But it had all the
features I needed.  The, uh, you know, the power and the, uh, adjustability
and power windows and things like that and the dashboard just looked good to
me.  It was just no nonsense.  Had the, the, uh, speedometer and the tack and
the, a couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the big
flashy electronic stuff.

A.11:  Yeah.  I, I've continually, I've come to learn in having this car that, it
was fully loaded --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- when we got it and the problem is it's the fully loaded gives the car
more chances for things to go wrong [laughter] --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- that make it not drivable and [throat_clearing] I had heard good things
about the Hondas, uh, especially the Accord, uh, but, uh, you know, we've been
we've been, we've been an American car family for the most part for a long
time.  Not because of any great desire to like, wow we're just going to buy
American because it's American --

B.16:  That's right [laughter].

A.17:  -- [Laughter] but, but, I don't know, it's just been traditional type of,
uh, General Motors type of car.  The last car we had was a, uh, a Grand Prix
which never again [laughter].

B.18:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.19:  That was a nightmare, that one.  Tha-, I mean, the thing just literally
fell apart [snorting] as time went on [throat_clearing].

B.20:  God!  Well, it's, well if you like American cars it's a good thing that
they're getting better, I'll tell you that.  You,

A.21:  Yeah.  It's, it's been, you know, the, the Park Avenue this year that's
come out.  You know, being a very high end type car --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- uh, they put a lot into it this year but the one in eighty-five
apparently was a problem year for them because they, you know, what's happened
is most people have just gotten rid of them.  As soon as, you know, they pass
the three year mark and things start going, they go and buy a new car.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  Well, with the northeast and the recession up here --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- you know, that's certainly not an easy option and [throat_clearing], uh,
we've kind of stuck with it, trying to keep it.  You know, we figure sooner or
later we'll probably replace everything on the silly thing and [laughter],

B.28:  Maybe it'll work right then, huh.

A.29:  Yeah [laughter] (( )) then when one of the doors fall off, then it's time
to get a new car #[laughter] you know.#

B.30:  #Great [laughter].# Yeah.  Well Chrysler is supposed to be, when, if you're
looking at reliability, Chrysler is supposed to be one of the best American
cars right now.  And the American cars, the, one advantages, one, one big
advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  So.  Anyway.  But, uh, some of the other things I like about, well some of
the things I don't like usually are, uh, the flashy stuff, you know.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  All the doors lock when you do something or, uh, uh, I used to, now I'm
getting more to where I think I might like a, a sun roof on my next car.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  I'm not really sure about that because I'm very much a person who, uh,
likes to drive around with every, with all the windows closed and the air
conditioning on so I can hear my stereo well [laughter].

A.37:  [Laughter] [throat_clearing].

B.38:  But, you know, so a sun roof or, or a tee top or something like that,
you're just going to have to crank the stereo up to compete with the wind
noise.

A.39:  Well you're in a climate that's a little bit more [laughter] where you need
the air conditioning more than we do up here.

B.40:  You bet.  They don't sell any cars down here without it you know.

A.41:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.  See up here, it's, it's definitely an option type
thing because we only have about three months of really hot weather --

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  -- everything else is fairly moderate, then we have the world famous
Rochester slash Buffalo winters [laughter],

B.44:  [Laughter].

A.45:  so a sun roof is really a snow roof, ooh look, snow #[laughter].#  

B.46:  #Yeah great [laughter].#

A.47:  I can't think what else you're going to see, you know [laughter].

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  Looking up at your doom as the snow comes pummeling down but,

B.50:  Oh, no [laughter].

A.51:  Well that's the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up
here that they pour on the roads.

B.52:  That's right, #right.#

A.53:  #And that's# what kills cars up here is, you know, the salt rusts them out
and then they die years before, you know, a car from California might be
#undrivable.#

B.54:  #Right.# Or, or they, they die of rust years before their major systems
would otherwise go out.

A.55:  Yeah, that's, that's what happened basically to our last car.  I mean it,
just this rust took over.
