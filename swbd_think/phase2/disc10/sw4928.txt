=========================================================================

A.1:  Well my exercise program consists of, uh, you know, it's, it's a
opportunity to stay alive really.

@B.2:  [Music] [TV] Huh.

A.3:  Instead of, you know, wasting my, my, the, you know, the, trying to exist
on the latency of my youth, the good health of my youth.  I'm, and what I like
to do is I like to stretch out and I like to run, uh, m-, I'm, I like to run,
get my heartbeat up.  I like to run about, oh, about two, two and a half
miles.  And then I like to work out on, uh, on the, uh, the Bailey Life C-,
Cycle machines up here at the, at the Holiday Spa.  And, and I, I think that,
you know, I've had a regiment now for about, you know, ten, fifteen years of,
of doing that and, uh, and I, I kind of think it's, uh, it's a lot of work but
I think it's, uh, it's a lot of work but I think it's, uh, it's the, uh, the
amount of effort that's required to, uh, to stay healthy, you know.  I have a
sedentary job and, uh, unless you do something like that, y-, you're going to
get sick.

B.4:  Right.  Yeah, I'm, I need to get, I'm, I'm pretty bad about that.  I'm
lazy.  I should, I know I want, I always say that I need to get run-, start
running and I'm going to try and do that this summer.  Because I never have
time.  I, I always put it off.  By the time I get back from classes it's late
at night and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the
track or whatever.  Because I'm, I'm getting a gut here.  I got to [laughter]
get back into shape.

A.5:  Well, I, uh, two years ago I started having trouble with my knee.  And, uh,
you know, I've got, you know, I figured well, it'll go away.  Well I s-, you
know, I'm, I've had to reduce my program, reduce my program and I've gained
fifteen pounds.

B.6:  Huh.

A.7:  And so, uh, you know, it's, e-, you know, I need to get back into swimming,
you know, instead of running.  If I can't swim or I can't run, I should be
able to swim.  Well I'm such a terrible swimmer and I, I, I really feel I can,
I can dedicate about an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes f-, to this effort.
But if it gets longer than that I, I, i-, it, I start not doing anything.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  And so, so I got a real problem in that regard.  Uh, it, do, you obviously
are, are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it.

B.10:  Yeah.  I mean, I do it, I guess, I'm going to do it, uh, because I want to
get in shape.  I'm not, it's not something I really enjoy all that much that,
I'll, I'll probably, I mean once I get into it and I, if I, if I get into
better shape then it'll be, it won't be as much of a, a chore to me.

A.11:  Well, it's, it's always a chore.  #I mean# --

B.12:  #Yeah.#

A.13:  -- I started doing this when I was about thirty-five --

B.14:  Huh.

A.15:  -- and now I'm fifty-five.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  And, uh, you know, I, I know that in, (( )) I just know that I'm going to
get blown away with some, some piece of nonsense.  Y-, you know, some health
related thing is going to blow me away.  That's the same way, I got too much
weight on right now.  #I# --

B.18:  #Right.#

A.19:  -- need to lose fifty pounds, you know.  I need to lose at least twenty,
you know.  But, uh, you know, it's, it's just, uh, I'm busy.  I'm doing a lot
of traveling and, uh, it, it creates a problem, uh, you know, when you're on
the road.  What sort of, uh, uh, what other programs other than say running?
Have you, have you ever done anything at all?

B.20:  Yeah, I have.  Uh, sit-ups or, al-, also last summer I was doing Nautilus
or last year [cough] I'm, uh, belong to a club right here.  Got kind of
expensive, uh, to r-, to r-, renew.  They wanted another fifty dollars.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  That was a little bit too much money.  But, uh, doing a mix of Nautilus and
free weights.  #I like that.#

A.23:  #(( )) club,# what club are you with?

B.24:  I'm sorry?

A.25:  What club were you with?

B.26:  It's called, oh, what was it called [laughter].  City Sports, downtown
Washington.

A.27:  Oh.  Okay.  So you're, you're down, you're downtown.

B.28:  Yeah.  I'm at, I'm at, I go to George Washington University. 

A.29:  Okay.  Yeah.  You're down there on, you know, twentieth and eighteenth 
and --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- #F G.#

B.32:  #It's (( )),# uh, Plaza.

A.33:  Oh.  Well, I'd, uh, well there's a, there's a Holiday Spa down there on, on
K street, I think.  Something like that.  But, uh, I, I go to the Holiday Spa
here in Alexandria and that's pretty good.  But, you know, evening time it
gets pretty busy.  But generally, you know, I can, I can get in and get a
program, you know.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  But, uh, you know, I, I need to, I need to rededicate myself to, uh, to
doing this and, uh, I got a problem, uh, you know, ever since my knee went
bad, of getting back solidly into it.  I mean, I've been doing this for
fifteen, twenty years.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  And, you know, and I'm, I know I'm going to get, I know it's going to bite
me in the ass and so I, I really don't want to, want to, uh, you know, back
off on it.

B.38:  Yeah.  It's something, I think, uh, I'm young, I should get started getting
into shape.  I don't want to, I want, I mean at one point it's going to be too
late to do it.  #(( )).#

A.39:  #Well,# no.  When you're young,

B.40:  [Cough].

A.41:  you, [noise] you can abuse your, your, all your systems and you can
recover.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  Uh, when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems, you get
blown away.

B.44:  Huh [/music] [/TV].

A.45:  And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye, you know.  And, uh, and
so the object,
