A.1:  [Breathing] [throat_clearing] You want to start or you want me to start?

B.2:  [Breathing] Well, go ahead #(( )).#

A.3:  #Okay.# Personal interests in computers, basically, nowadays, it seems like
you can't get by without one.  Everywhere I go it's got some kind of computer
interface.  Like pressing on a keyboards, uh, pressing in personal
identification numbers, all the A T M machines, things like that.  I
personally don't own one because I can't afford one.  Uh, every time you look
in a friends houses and they show their computers and all the knickknacks
they have, it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these
peripheral devices like, uh, modems and fancy printers or lazy printers and fax
machines and games that they like to play.  Course, I, (( )) I was impressed
by some of the games they have.  Like flight simular game, simulator for the
different aircraft.

@B.4:  Yeah, well that's, uh, actually ((you)) might say even more than just a
game.  It's, uh, similar to the one they use at, uh, for training.

A.5:  Very close to it, I understand.  Except for the bouncing around (( )).

B.6:  [Snorting] Well I have a, I just got a, I used to use a T I P C at work.
Now I just got a Three Eighty-Six, uh, computer, P C.

A.7:  [Swallowing] You use it mostly for spreadsheets or do you use it for, like,
word processing?

B.8:  Uh, [sigh] well I use it, uh, in my business I have to, uh, tie into the
mainframe and also into a, uh, minicomputer, a Nine Ninety.  So I use a
terminal emulation in, uh, talking to other computers.  Plus word processing.
I do quite a bit of that [lipsmack].  And it's, uh, that's sup-, one of the
features of the new one, the Three Eighty-Six.  It's got windows on it and so
you can toggle back and forth between, uh, applications and, you know, get a,
get a lot quicker in and out.  Used to be you had to log off,
[throat_clearing] then log back on the other application.

A.9:  Yeah, I use a Z Two Forty-Eight, Two Eighty-Six at work.  But it's
basically to tie into the communications network.  Then through our
communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And use the Unix operating systems.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  Use their V I Editor and we use, uh, read on line news through it and we
also have terminal emulations through I B M Thirty-Two Seventy-Eight.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  And, [sigh] I don't know, I just don't, I don't even use the hard disk
drive to, to copy any floppy disks or anything like that.  I just basically
use it for a window into their --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- to the Unix world.

B.18:  Yeah, uh, we're supposed to be getting a Fifteen Hundred minicomputer
pretty soon #to replace our Nine Ninety.#

A.19:  #Yeah, is that I B M or,#  

B.20:  Huh?

A.21:  Is that an I B M type?

B.22:  Uh, no, it's a T I made Fifteen Hundred.  It's a, a minicomputer.  Uh, it's
a newer version of the Nine Ninety, which is one they had.  It uses, uh, Unix
as one of the operating systems.  But, uh,

A.23:  I'm familiar with Unix commands like, uh, copying files and compressing
them, things like that.  I just have a fun time using their mainframe at the
base but,

B.24:  [Laughter] Well Unix to me, I mean, uh, that's system five.  I mean that's
pretty [lipsmack], looks pretty, uh, user unfriendly [laughter].

A.25:  [Breathing] [laughter].

B.26:  Uh,

A.27:  ((I think a)) different language all right.  

B.28:  [Swallowing] It seems like this year, uh, got a lot of stuff to learn.  I
haven't used it that much, so.

A.29:  Yeah, we can use System Five or we can use, uh, Seashell, you know.  I
like, uh, I favor Seashell over the other.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  In fact I think most of our users like (( )) because they were trained in
it and they just don't want to learn something different.

B.32:  [Laughter] That, uh, that's a powerful force [laughter].  Once you,

A.33:  Pardon?

B.34:  That's a power force.  Once you learn something you tend to want to stick
with it.

A.35:  Oh, yeah.  Plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people
come in, they kind of help each other out.  But you have different people with
different backgrounds and they [inhaling] have a hard time sharing information
[breathing].

B.36:  That's like I learned, uh, D F M and P F M, you know, Professional File
Manager, which is, can be used as a word processor.  It doesn't, it does
everything I need.  Moves, splits, you know, all that.  But, uh, it doesn't
have some of the little fancy stuff like underline, caps, bow, I mean bold and
all that so, uh, that's, other than that it's, you know, perfectly suitable
for most things I do.

A.37:  Yeah, the dis-, disadvantage of V I Editor, you can't see all those fancy
things [inhaling].  I have another thing called Q Office from Quadratron, back
in California that people like to use but it's a very slow system.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  And I understand it's only on, like we use a Gold Nine Thousand Fifty, and
that's basically their format they use for word processing.  And they're
trying to push people into using either Word Per-, [/breathing],
