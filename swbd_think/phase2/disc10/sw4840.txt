=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, [laughter] well, we just got our income tax return and I'm
perfectly happy.  What about you [laughter]?

B.2:  Well, let's see.  I haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all
that stuff at, uh, at home --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- in the Bay area.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  So, I'm not sure how much I'm getting back but I'm pretty sure I should get
back a little bit since #(( )) student, so [noise].#

A.7:  #Yeah.#

B.8:  It's not too much.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Not too bad though [noise].

A.11:  But as far as writing checks out and paying taxes, I think it's pretty
high.  But I, I'm, you know, I, I guess it's where we have to be, where it,
[static] we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that,
that we have and [sniffing].

B.12:  [Noise] Yeah.  It, it's one of those necessities of life that we all have
to, ((you know)), pay taxes but, although it is kind of a pain sometimes
though.

A.13:  [Children] It's just scary though about, you know.  How high are the taxes
going to be when my children are my age?

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  You know, that, that's, that's scary too.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  Because it's not anything like the way it was when I was young and small
and a child.  So, you know, that, that's a scary part too, that you have to
think about.

B.18:  Yeah.  #And, and [/noise],#

A.19:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.20:  like, as time goes on, you know, things get more expensive and because we
were (( )) increasingly complex society that --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- day by day things get more, uh, things get more expensive as well as
more complex.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  And, you know, [noise] taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of
the things that are needed in this society.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  I mean, everything from, you know, from medicare to, uh, to social security
to, uh, to feeding the h-, to, uh, to, you know, feeding the homeless, to
maintaining prisons, to maintaining polices or fire departments and things
like that.  And it's, [noise] now there's more and more things that need
attending to and that sort of thing.  And, you know --

A.27:  Uh-huh [/static].

B.28:  -- it's, it's becoming a larger [squeak] responsibility but someone
[squeak] has to pay for it and that's us.

A.29:  Yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your
taxes, you know, taxpayers, are, is your money going to where you want
it to go and.  There's going to a special this week.  I, I can't, I
can't if it's TWENTY TWENTY [sniffing] or one of those things where,
uh, I think it's one of the local news.  I think they're having a
documentary.  Something about that.  About their trying to catch
some people that [swallowing], not spending your tax monies right and
fraud and that kind of thing, you know and that's kind of scary too
[sniffing].

B.30:  Uh-huh [squeak].

A.31:  And, uh, so that would be interesting to see [noise].  I wanted to see that
program.

B.32:  Yeah.  And, and, even, even today it's like the (( )) amount of taxes that,
you know, we're paying for.  But you'd think that we're ((still in)), that
this, this, uh, deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just
because --

A.33:  [Child_talking] Oh, I know [laughter]

B.34:  -- the budget's not big enough as it is.

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  And,

A.37:  [Children].

B.38:  makes you wonder when there's, you know, countries out there that have, you
know, tax rates of like close to fifty percent or higher.

A.39:  [Children].

B.40:  You know, it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone
before you even get it.

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  And that, that's kind of a scary thought.  I hope it doesn't come down to
that.

A.43:  Yeah [laughter].

B.44:  But, on the other hand, they also, while those countries that have high
taxes, also have things like, uh, [swallowing] socialized medicine, things
like that too, which are nice fringe benefits of it.  So everyone has,
everyone has the access [squeak] to medical facilities as well as the doctors.
That sort of thing.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  And it's good but it's, it's the price they pay [laughter].

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  [Noise] I mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically
it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that
because those countries tend to be, uh, as far as cash flow, a lot, uh, have
be, tend to have a much slower cash flow --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and don't ((generate)) a larger a, a large amount of revenue because
there's so little, uh, currency flow through out the economic system [squeak].

A.51:  Huh.  Well you sure do know a l-, a lot [laughter]. 

B.52:  Well, just keeping up with the times, #that's all.#

A.53:  #Yeah [static], yeah.#

B.54:  As, as it turns out, you know, it's one of those, one of those
((interests)), you know, I kind of like to keep up on.  Because, well it's
nice to know that when I'm actually, you know, I do start working that, I like
to know where my tax dollars are going too.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  (( )) work hard to get, you know.  I like to know where it's going to.

A.57:  Yeah, yeah.  That's true.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  What do you think about these items that are going to be, uh, taxed even
more.  Like, uh, tobacco and that kind of thing [sniffing].

B.60:  I think in a, in a way it's good, in a way it's not.  Uh, but I think in
general [squeak] it's probably good.  I mean, a lot of things like tobacco and
alcohol and things like that have been, have been, in the past, uh, have been
not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them, #against# --

A.61:  #Uh-huh.#

B.62:  -- the taxes for them.  Sponsored by the alcohol and tobacco companies. 

@@A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  And it's things like tobacco are, uh, they're, they're a proven health
hazard to #smokers# --

A.65:  #Yeah.#

B.66:  -- as well as nonsmokers [sniffing].  

A.67:  Right.

B.68:  And it's, as far as the safety thing, in, like in San Luis Obispo, for
example, there's an ordnance which states that, uh, there's no smoking in any
public areas.  And so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no
smoking allowed anywhere.

A.69:  Oh, really [/children] [/static].
