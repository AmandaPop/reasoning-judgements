B.1:  Okay.  Well what's happening in New York #[laughter]?#

A.2:  #[Scratching] {sounds like she is twisting her receiver}.  Oh, what's
happening# in New York?  We're all reading about Los Angeles #[laughter] I
think.#

B.3:  #[Laughter]# Well that's what we're doing too on our, our current events
and it's all over the, of course the T V.  And we're having a little bit of,
uh, uh, you know, demonstrations here in Dallas but not anything like they're
having in L A.

A.4:  I should hope not [laughter].  

B.5:  [Sigh] Really.  

A.6:  I, I, I was just reading this morning in the paper that it's also spreading
to San Francisco as well.

B.7:  Oh, is that right?  #Well, it,# 

A.8:  #The rioting# and all that #kind of thing.#

B.9:  #Uh-huh.  And# last night it was going into some of the nicer areas too,
you know.  Rather than just staying in the, in the, uh, in the sections that
it started in.

A.10:  Huh.

B.11:  But, uh, [sigh] #I get# --

A.12:  #Do you get,# 

B.13:  -- my current events, uh, all three ways.  You know, talking to people, uh,
some T V, although not much T V.  And, uh, reading the paper. #((And)),#

A.14:  #Uh, I'm# big on the morning radio.  I guess I wo-, get woken up by the
alarm and catch the day's news [laughter] real quickly [scratching].

B.15:  Well, that's something I used to do when I had a long drive to work #or 
a# --

A.16:  #Uh-huh.#

B.17:  -- or a, maybe a thirty or forty minute drive to work.  I would turn the,
the news on and listen to that all the way.  [inhaling] But I don't do that
anymore.  It's just that I guess a habit I've gotten ou-, out of and that's,
uh, that's a real good way to get everything recapped.

A.18:  You know, I was just doing some thinking recently on, we only hear, we hear
the news in a slanted fashion by how it's reported to us.

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  I was looking at this morning's paper and you see, uh, you know, the cover
photo is a truck and, and in the background everything's in [scratching]
flames.

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  And I think they kind of, uh, set you up in a way.

B.23:  Uh, well I know they do [laughter].  I was, uh, I worked in public
relations for a, Safeway Stores, which was a, is a big grocery chain.  Used to
be in this area, it's not here any longer.  And it used to be in New York.  I
don't know #if# --

A.24:  #I've# heard of it.

B.25:  -- and, uh, I was their, uh, press person.  Uh, public relations person for
about five [thumping] years and handled all of the press.  And [sigh] I would
tell them one thing on the phone, very carefully, uh, and they would report it
[laughter] not so carefully.  And in different context.  You had to be so
careful.  Uh, whenever there was an interview on television, [clicking] uh,
they would tape a interview.  Ask you lots of questions and then they would
just take excerpts out that, [clicking] uh, you know, standing alone didn't
mean the same thing [lipsmack].  And so, but we just really, you really had,
we had a tough time, uh, relating to what you actually, what was actually
going on as to what was being reported.

A.26:  Um.  I, I think, uh, the news is starting to think of itself as theater.

B.27:  Well, I think you're, you may be right there too.  Uh, [noise] and I can
see where, did you happen to hear the, uh, interview of the, uh, juror, uh --

A.28:  No.

B.29:  -- last night on T V?

A.30:  No.

B.31:  She said that the public saw only a small portion of that tape.  Now I, you
know, on this Rodney King.

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  Now I can't side with her, you know [laughter].  Because they, you know,
you can see what was happening and that's totally wrong.  But, you know, we
were shown just a portion of something.  We weren't shown a whole picture.

A.34:  We-, well something I read in the paper was, you know, if you just hear the
headlines, you don't know that there were three other people in the car --

B.35:  Uh-huh.

A.36:  -- that was stopped.  Who got out.  Put their hands up and said, okay we
give up.

B.37:  [Swallowing] That's exactly right.

A.38:  You know.  And --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  -- they don't tell you that.  That makes you so angry to think that, oh
they beat on this poor man.

B.41:  This one #person.#

A.42:  #But he# he had a choice to, you know.  This all could have been, you know,
avoided #if he had# --

B.43:  #Exactly.#

A.44:  -- behaved himself.  I, I, I believe they overreacted horribly.  

B.45:  Right.

A.46:  But, you know, if you think of the cop's point of view.  He has a wife and
two kids and he wants to get home tonight.  And he doesn't know how crazy this
guy is.

B.47:  Exactly.

A.48:  So everybody is #fighting for their life.#

B.49:  #And he's resisting.#

A.50:  And you can see how this can get out of hand.

B.51:  Uh-huh.  Exactly.

A.52:  But.

B.53:  But like you said, we were not shown that.  We were not, uh, unless we, you
know, read indepth, you, you get that, you don't get that impression and so
that makes everybody up in arms.

A.54:  I've been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism that's going on.  I
was, uh, visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in Ca-, in, uh,
California near San Francisco.  And the big thing out there was they were
finally, after twenty-five years, going to execute someone.

B.55:  Uh-huh.

A.56:  Uh, whereas, they've always had a death penalty {mispronounced}, penalty,
they always put it off.

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  And she had the T V on and they go to, they go on to say well, the cyanide
came into the room and after about a minute his head slumped.  And they went
into gr-, gross detail.

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  I mean why is this on T V?  Is this news?  Do we want to know it?

B.61:  Right [laughter].

A.62:  It was disgusting.  And this whole thing with Willie Kennedy Smith, you
know.  #Did he# --

B.63:  #Uh-huh.#

A.64:  -- rape this girl?  Did he not?  Why is that headline news?  

B.65:  Well, it wouldn't be if it was anyone else.  #It wouldn't have been,#

A.66:  #Yeah.  But I# mean I think the newspapers are irrespons-, [/scratching].
