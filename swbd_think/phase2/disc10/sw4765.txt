REMARKS:         Both speakers were hard to understand due to either repeating
themselves, mumbling or talking over each other.

============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, [throat_clearing] a lot of companies now are, are using, uh, drug
testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the
either, uh, [sigh] elementary or intermediate or advanced, uh, drug users.

@B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  And, uh, I know the, the government is, uh, you know, gives drug tests an-,
to all new entrants, all new appli-, applicants coming into government.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  And, and I quite frankly, don't see anything wrong with it.  I, I'm, I
guess I'm not a good civil libertarian.

B.6:  [Laughter].

A.7:  And, and I, I feel as though, uh, that, uh, uh, you know, that if you,
you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really
go into a deep background.  Of course, we're, we're, being involved in my
organization, uh, we, we have deep background checks #and# --

B.8:  #Sure, sure.#

A.9:  -- and so, uh, but, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can, can escape
that.  And, uh, I have absolutely --

B.10:  Huh.

A.11:  -- no compunction about, uh, using any and all means to, to, uh, uh, you
know, work out, figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and, uh, and putting that guy into, into therapy to, whatever it is to,
to, you know, break this, uh, activity.  Of course, if he's fallen in love
with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is, is the only
thing in life that seems to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope
[laughter].

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  What's your, uh, feeling?

B.16:  Uh, well I guess I, I guess I'm probably a little more to, toward the other
direction.

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  Uh, well I guess, mainly because, uh, it's, I, well, like there's two sides
to it I guess.  Uh, one is that, uh, if you're coming to work under the
influence of any sort of drug, alcohol, whatever, or, you know, even if it's
smoking, inhibits, you know, your ability to function, then I, I think that,
that, you know, I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual,
you know, on the spot.  Uh, but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing
in your own private life is your own private business.  Uh, and I guess part
of the reason there is because of the fact that, uh, things like drug laws
seem to come and go.  You know, we had prohibition for awhile and then we
didn't have prohibition.  Uh, you know, we've had, I guess, laws against, uh,
you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy
years, I guess.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Maybe a little longer.  

A.21:  Well I think, uh, the dr-, the laws on, uh, uh, uh, the first morphine laws
were, were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that.

B.22:  Yeah.  So, ei-, eighty years or so.  #Yeah.#

A.23:  #Yeah.#  

B.24:  Uh, so I, you know, it's, it's hard to, I guess, for me to justify what
so-, seems like, you know, basically a breach of the First Amen-, you know,
freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that may or
may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years from now or even twenty or ten,
who knows.

A.25:  Well, the thing of it #is the, the, tha-, tha-,# --

B.26:  #I mean, prohibition certainly didn't last.#

A.27:  -- that, that is, uh, uh, in, in many respects, uh, uh, you know, just,
just, I think, an over simplification.  I, I think there, th-, th-, th-,
there's so much criminal activity, uh, #that people go into to, to support
drug habits.#

B.28:  #Well, but you got to look at prohibition though.  You had the same
problems there, right?#

A.29:  Yeah.  You know, they, they support drug habits with, uh, with, uh, you
know, with things like, uh, you know, burglary or, or #prostitution or stuff
like that, yeah.#

B.30:  #Oh, yeah.  Sure.# Well it goes back to that, again, if you look at
prohibition.  I mean because it's illegal, it costs more.  If it was legal, I
mean, face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty
dollars an ounce.

A.31:  I, I #I [static] must admit that,# 

B.32:  #And clearly if you're# into coke and all you want to do is, you know,
snort your brains out all day long, if it was legal, you could do it real
cheap and, you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you
stayed at home and did it.

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  But, yeah, get, uh,

A.35:  Yeah.  I, I must admit that the production costs of, of these drugs are,
are zippo compared to the street market #costs and, and the costs to society,
yeah.#

B.36:  #Oh, yeah, well that's why there's, you know, people dealing it because
there's money in it, you know.  There's ridiculous amounts of money.#

A.37:  But I, I, I, I think that, that the, that, you know, the, being in law
enforcement, you know, th-, th-, th-, they, I, I probably have a kind of a
draconian, Philistine attitude toward it.

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  And, but, but the, uh, uh, I, I really feel as though the interdiction
effort is, is, as soon as you, you get rid of one goon that's, that's, that's
involved in #drugs and tha-,# 

B.40:  #Oh yeah, interdiction's# hopeless.  #I mean# -- 

A.41:  #Yeah, and# then another, another #one will jump up.#

B.42:  -- #there's no way you're ever# going to win that.

A.43:  But #we, we see,# 

B.44:  #The tighter you squeeze,# the more the price goes up, the more incentive
there is.  #I mean that's a losing ((fight)).#

A.45:  #Yeah.  A-, a-,# as soon as we wind up, uh, uh, you know, for, well if we
can just destroy the market by destroying the demand but, but people --

B.46:  Yeah, #yeah.#

A.47:  -- #want to,# get, get stoned and I, I don't see #that,# 

B.48:  #Well,# yeah.  It goes back to, you know, what right, what can society
impose on people.  I mean, can you force somebody to be a good productive
citizen?

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  I don't think you can.  I mean, you know, I'm, you know, was raised with
being a very strong Bible work ethic so, you know, I'm one of these, you know,
ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty hour a day type people.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  So, you know, yeah, I can really relate to yeah, everybody ought to do
their own share, you know.  I don't have any, you know, love lost for people
who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that
kind of stuff.

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  But, you know,
