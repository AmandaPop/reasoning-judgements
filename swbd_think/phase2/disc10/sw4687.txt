REMARKS:        Speaker B mumbled and spoke in low voice.  He was hard
to understand.

===========================================================================

A.1:  Well, uh, my opinion on taxation.  Well, being in New York state [laughter]
where taxes are high and services are low --

@B.2:  Huh [noise].

A.3:  -- I guess I'd have to say I don't think we're getting our money's worth as
far as, uh, the tax system is concerned.  I think a lot of it is going to
waste on, uh, services that aren't necessary and, uh, out-of-date ideas that
just don't make sense anymore in these times.

B.4:  Yeah, I, I'd have to agree.  I'm, uh, right now I'm in, in Atlanta but I
grew up and am from, uh, Utica, New York.  So, uh, I understand and I agree
[laughter] with the New York situation.

A.5:  Huh {very faint}.  Yeah, it's, as a matter of fact they recently, in our
county here, our state sales tax has been seven percent --

B.6:  Right. 

A.7:  -- pretty much forever.  Well, they've just decided now when our county
where I am, is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close
a deficit --

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  -- uh, that they've found in the county budget here and, uh, you know,
between the increases in the sales tax and, of course, we have the high state
tax --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- now we have to look into the possibility of, you know, if it isn't from
the Bush administration with user fees, it's more direct taxation.

B.12:  [Noise] Right.

A.13:  I don't know what the taxes are like down in Georgia.

B.14:  Well, uh, it's kind of tough to tell.  I haven't really got no good feel
for it yet.  The, uh, I've been down here for only six months so i-, uh,
they're not, I don't think they're quite as bad as they are in New York state,
I guess is my opinion right now.  Uh, there is like, there are, there is a tax
on food here which is, you know, a little bit different because they don't
have that up there.  And, other than that, right now they're starting to
realize that their taxes are low but they also realize that they still have to
[noise] make sure their roads are paved and so on, so they're starting to talk
about, uh, raising, like instead of registering or, uh, getting your license
which costs five dollars, now they decide well maybe we should charge forty
dollars for it.

A.15:  [Laughter] Well they just did that up here too.  It --

B.16:  Right.

A.17:  -- M-, Mario raised [laughter] it up here, uh, considerably, and, you know,
we've had our r-, road taxes #and# --

B.18:  #Yeah.#

A.19:  -- gas ta-, the gas tax was such a boondoggle.  Being from Utica, you
probably, uh, remember when they put that #into effect and# --

B.20:  #[Noise] Yeah that'll,#

A.21:  -- how that was going to save our roads #[laughter].#

B.22:  #Right.#

A.23:  And what it did is it all went to New York City to #[laughter]# --

B.24:  #Of course.#

A.25:  -- refurbish that subway #disaster [laughter].#

B.26:  #Of course.# No, that seems like we're in, from your {mispronounced} state,
you're pretty much, your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow, um,
you know, taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big
funnel towards New York City.

A.27:  Well yeah, it's, you know, roads this year have been especially bad.
They, uh, here in Rochester, they've now b-, to save tax money and that,
they've turned off the expressway lights at night [laughter].

B.28:  Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.  Yeah.  They've been talking about doing that here too
but they haven't, they've almost been able to push it through but people
started complaining and,

A.29:  Well, they just shoved it through here and, [laughter] you know, to hell
with people #and, uh# --

B.30:  #Yeah.#

A.31:  -- put it into effect and then suddenly, of course, you know, ever since,
every day in the newspaper here it's people complaining well it was only
saving two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year.  S-, we're paying good tax
money for this and --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- they turned it off.  Yet they're still giving money to all these bizarre
things in New York City.

B.34:  Right.

A.35:  The roads aren't any better here.

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  [Sigh] And, uh, even the town here where I am in, uh, the taxes have
increased again.  I mean they just can't push property taxes any higher.
That's why they're looking at this sales tax business now.

B.38:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's, down here they're, uh, tha-, I'm amazed at, the one
cheap thing down here is gas.  I'm not sure what the price is up there but
that down here it's only like eighty-nine cents #per, per gallon.#

A.39:  #Oh, that's not moving.# You know, that Mario up here is, we're, I just
filled up tonight, it was a dollar, it's a dollar fifteen nine a gallon.

B.40:  Yeah.  I was home over an-, at Christmas break and it was,

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  I saw the gas prices and ((thought)) boy what a switch.  

A.43:  Well, you know, we also have somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas
suppliers.  You know, anywhere else in the state it's about a nickel less --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- but they say it's going to increase around the summer time to a dollar
twenty-five #up here.#

B.46:  #Oh, sure.#  Yeah.  

A.47:  Which is insane [snorting].

B.48:  Yeah.  Well, as soon as they get near Memorial Day, people start traveling
and everyone knows it so we've got to raise the gas prices.

A.49:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.  

B.50:  So [noise].

@@A.51:  [Inhaling] Oh, well, it, it's interesting topic coming two days from tax
day #[laughter].#

B.52:  #[Laughter] Yes, I know.# I and I just, I actually had filed earlier and
got my refund tonight actually.  #Small, but# --

A.53:  #Yeah.  We're [noise]# --

B.54:  -- #small but, uh ((I got)),#

A.55:  -- #we're just# sitting down tonight to get ours [laughter] filled out.

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  We're going to do it, we're going to do it and we're going to get, we were
doing software to do #it and# --

B.58:  #Oh, yeah.# 

A.59:  -- then, you know, put o-, put it off, put it off.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  Now tonight [laughter], being two days left [laughter].

B.62:  Yeah.  Well it's #pre-,#

A.63:  #Okay.#

B.64:  pretty frustrating when you see the whole situation,
