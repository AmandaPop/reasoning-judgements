==========================================================================

A.1:  think is wrong with the public school system is that I think we've lately,
in the last twenty years or so, kind of lost focus with the basics, uh, in
order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where, uh, we're teaching
kids not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on
particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going
into a career, uh, about.  And the problem comes about if these people aren't
well-rounded students or graduates, that that sort of traps them in the field
that they've spent all this time being educated in.

B.2:  I think there's something to that.  Yeah, yeah, I tend to agree.  Uh, well
I remember now, it's been quite a few years since my kids were in high school,
I'm getting that old.  But, uh, I remember, uh, being a little surprised at
the, uh, the catalog of courses.  Like instead of taking a survey course on
American Literature, you had, you chose from, uh, it almost looked like a
college catalog --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and, uh, the courses were too specialized as you said.  And you just
read, you know, they, they take a whole semester long course on, uh, on one
writer or something.  Uh, that's fine for college [noise] but it seems kind of
silly for high school [throat_clearing].

A.5:  Yeah.  That's, it's, I'm only twenty-four years old so I've was through a
lot of that, uh, although,

B.6:  You'd be about the same age as my sons.  Yeah.

A.7:  [Laughter] Well in my, luckily up here, the school system up here was
intelligent enough that they didn't want to get that focused and they drilled
into our heads and the same thing with the college that I went to,

B.8:  [Noise].

A.9:  to get as broad of an education as possible so that you're down with the
basics and then once you know what you want to do, then try and, uh, get some
specific courses.  But I remember one of the things that they were always
drilling into us was the need to learn how to communicate effectively through
writing --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and I, I constantly come up against some of the writings, being involved
in, uh, computers and the like where I see other people writing and it's
embarrassing [laughter].

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  You know, it's some of these things that and I've seen papers that in sixth
grade I wouldn't have had returned, uh, to me, which are getting A -s in
college today.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  The standards have really fallen.

B.16:  Yeah, yeah.  I taught college for awhile.

A.17:  [Throat_clearing].

B.18:  Not recently, but, uh, yeah, I remember I, I was quite surprised at, uh, I
mean, you start rejecting things on that basis, you end up handing, uh,
everybody's papers back.

A.19:  [Cough].

B.20:  That's probably what we should have done [laughter].

A.21:  Huh.  Yeah, it, it, the only way that I ever, you know, I, I took Comp
Journalism as a major and, uh, the writing they, what they would do is they
would focus in on our particular problems on the college level course --

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  -- and, uh, uh, would then work with us as far as fixing those things.  I
had a problem with, uh, writing excessive verbiage --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- uh, in my writing and I, they taught me, basically, how to pare it down
a little bit.  And I, I don't see that in a broader, you know, even in a
public school, uh, situation,

B.26:  [Throat_clearing].

A.27:  because a lot of the teachers have these large classes that they can't
devote the individual attention --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- to each student that they may have twenty or thirty years ago.  

B.30:  Yeah, I sup-, I guess the class sizes are bigger now.  I guess they must
be.

A.31:  I remember large group in certain, uh, courses, mainly Political Science.
We'd have lectures where there'd be three hundred students --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and if you had a question, you know, or, or didn't understand it at all,
of course you're not going to raise your hand in a [laughter] three hundred
group --

B.34:  No.

A.35:  -- [Laughter] thing and say I don't know what you're talking about.
They're going to just keep their mouth shut [laughter].  #And I think, you
know# --

B.36:  #Right.  They need smaller discussion,# 

A.37:  -- it's those kinds of things that, I, I'm not sure how we go about fixing
something like that other than maybe devoting some more, uh, uh, resources
into first of all getting, uh, the, uh, teachers reasonable salaries and, uh,
expecting in return some sort of standard and, uh, s-, you know, some proof
that what they're doing is actually worth what we want to pay them --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- and then try and get maybe more involvement with the parents
[swallowing].  A lot of parents expect the schools to just take care of their
kids and, uh, you know, you, it's your job --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- not mine. 

B.42:  Well I've been reading about some successful school systems, 

A.43:  [Cough].

B.44:  and it does seem that parental involvement is the, is the common, uh,
factor and everybody's doing anything that works these days, so that's
probably, uh, one of the big keys.

A.45:  Well how are the schools down in your area these days?

B.46:  Well actually, they're pretty good.  Uh, I, I used to live in Wisconsin.  I
only moved to Texas about four years ago.  But, uh,
