A.1:  Have you any thoughts?

B.2:  Well, you called here so [laughter].

@A.3:  Okay.  Well, uh, I'll tell you.  I am, uh, uh, impressed with the, uh, uh,
amount of spending that's occurred so far as far as AIDS research and I think
that, uh, proportionately, maybe, uh, so far it's been enough.  It seems like,
it seems like, uh, there's not, [sigh] uh, been any money taken away from
other necessary medical research, uh, uh, subjects, uh, you know, in, in,
allocated towards the AIDS research.  I think that AIDS research has been, a,
a lot of the funding has not been done by the government.  A lot of it has been
done by private endowment.  Uh, but I think the government is doing a good
job, so far, of keeping the, uh, their portion of the funding up.

B.4:  Well, I, uh, I agree to an extent.  Uh, I think the problem is, is that
we're spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do
when they're under public pressure is to throw money at the problem --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- in an attempt to try and solve it as quickly as possible.  And they did
that with the Pentagon in the eighties [laughter].

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And when you have a lot of money in your budget and you don't want to have
to cut back, you spend it.  Even if it means throwing it away.

A.9:  Right.

B.10:  Uh, I think that while we need to spend more effort and money on things
like education and maybe even alternative treatments and alternative ex-,
things to keep those afflicted alive at this point --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- I think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to
something that is a proven point, not just thrown at it.

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  Uh, I, I don't see that the money is being removed from any other causes.
Uh, AIDS has been a problem though, especially in the eighties, when there
wasn't a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and that people really didn't, groups didn't want to be associated with
it because it was a morals issue.

A.17:  Right.

B.18:  I think we're finally getting over that.  I thought that was ridiculous.
Reading and hearing about that kind of morals dilemma stuff.  But [snorting] I
think that it, we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over
this thing that we have about not confronting this head on with some factual
advertising for items of condoms and things like that, that --

A.19:  Uh-huh. 

B.20:  -- will help prevent the, uh, disease as well as instilling the notion that
the best way not to get it is not to involve yourselves in unsafe practices in
the first place [laughter].

A.21:  Exactly.  Uh, it, although I was, uh, I, I was, 

B.22:  [Throat_clearing].

A.23:  shocked at the public, uh, uh, outrage, uh, that occurred after, after, I
think it was Dan Quayle who said, uh, you know, who suggested that maybe, maybe
we, you know, maybe that is a, a possible and, and, uh, uh, likely most
effective solution is, you know, abstinence and, and, yet the, a large portion
of the community said well that's stupid, you know.  That just shows that you
have no interest in, in, in spending any money on the, on the problem.  And I
thought, th-, th-, that's not, that's not the point at all.

B.24:  Well, the, the problem is that with this administration, at least, when
they say abstinence, they often couch that in other things that turn into one
of these morals issues which, uh, makes it turn into a political issue.  Now
you see the problem is you have people in the National Institutes of Health in
Atlanta and the like --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- the Centers for Disease Control which have fundamentalists in charge of
the thing who won't even let you say condom in a meeting.

A.27:  Right.

B.28:  And these things have been spread around and, i-, immediately people think
well abstinence.  Okay, here we have these religious zealots telling us where
they're trying to ignore the problem, blah, blah, blah and of course they
overreact --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- when they say that.  The fact that it's just good, medical, safe
practice, you know.  Don't expose yourself in the first place --

A.31:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

B.32:  -- but the, it's because th-, th-, you know, this administration was around
when Reagan, when the disease first was discovered here and all the social,
you know, implications of the Reagan administration ignoring it when it first
became an issue and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- you see, it's all carrying over now.

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  And that's why you're seeing that.  

A.37:  Okay.  That makes a little bit of sense.

B.38:  [Throat_clearing].

A.39:  Uh, I, I hadn't, I was not aware that that was, uh, such a, a, within the N
I H, that, uh, that was much, uh, [sniffing],

B.40:  Yeah.  There is.  Because what happened is a lot of these people and staff
members are political appointees --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- from the south especially, who come along with a variety of different
religious beliefs.  Some of which hold very fervent beliefs and will take
their beliefs into the workplace.  In, and in this case, a lot of people
consider that to be standing in the way of science and #medicine# --

A.43:  #Uh-huh.#

B.44:  -- to try and solve this thing.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  But, I, I don't like throwing money at the problem, uh, because,
