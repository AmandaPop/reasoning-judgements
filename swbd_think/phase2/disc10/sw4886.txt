=============================================================================

A.1:  Are you in the middle of anything?

B.2:  [Static] No.  I'm not in the middle of anything.  I've just, about the last
thing I did about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my
dad add on another bedroom on to his house.  So, #I guess that,#

A.3:  #The whole thing?#

B.4:  Yeah.  That, that was fairly large undertaking.  A, a, it's a bedroom and a
walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house.

A.5:  Did the framing and all?

B.6:  Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking.

A.7:  Huh.

B.8:  That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and
things like that we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that and.

A.9:  Maybe you and I should get together.  Because when I had my last big
project, I had the contractor do the framing and I did all the sheetrocking
[laughter] and the interior work [throat_clearing].

B.10:  [Laughter] Yeah, that's the exact opposite.  We did all, put the roof up
and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up.  We just
didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have, you
know, get those joints to go together --

A.11:  Ye-,

B.12:  -- and whatever you have to put in there to get the, s-, to take the gaps
out between the sheets --

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  -- and on the ceiling and all that.  I di-, we didn't know a thing about
any of that and #so,# 

A.15:  #My# wife wishes I hadn't done that.

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter].

B.18:  It's, it looked very hard to do so,

A.19:  [Throat_clearing].

B.20:  we figured well just, I didn't think we could do it and make it look
professional.  So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living.
But,

A.21:  I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy.

B.22:  Probably so and I,

A.23:  [Cough].

B.24:  we'd never done it so --

A.25:  Yeah [sniffing].

B.26:  -- we just left it alone.  But that's, I guess, I'm only twenty-one so I,
my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much.  So
it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my
parents so.

A.27:  Did you, you framed it in f-, uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage
or was it stuff that was already, uh, #enclosed?#

B.28:  #It was brand# new.

A.29:  Brand new #(( )).#

B.30:  #We started# with the backyard and turned it into part of the house so #it
was,# 

A.31:  #A-, and# you knew how, you knew how to do the framing?  

B.32:  Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it, #you know.#

A.33:  #Uh-huh.#

B.34:  He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it.
I don't know.  He, well he did all the flooring himself.  He put the whole,
the whole floor in and then I just started with the walls and the roof and
started there.  And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a
garage, but just like a, off the side of that after we had the house part
made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a
carport more or less.  It's not, you know, it's not enclosed.  It's just
somewhere to drive another car to, to park and it's,

A.35:  Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground?

B.36:  Uh, it's off the ground.

A.37:  On the piers?

B.38:  Uh-huh.  It's on about --

A.39:  Did,

B.40:  -- uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that.

A.41:  You had those #poured# --

B.42:  #So.#

A.43:  -- or you did them yourself?

B.44:  Uh, no, those, those are, we did those ourselves so.

A.45:  You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete?  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  Huh.

B.48:  Exactly, so.  #It's,# 

A.49:  #Well,# the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I
was pretty proud of [laughter] [noise].

B.50:  Yeah, those ar-, those are, we'd, I've done one, I helped somebody do one
of those before.  Those are, those are, you know, you can buy them in kits but
we didn't do that way.  But it's,

A.51:  No I designed it from scratch and #did it# --

B.52:  #Yeah.#

A.53:  -- did a pretty good job.  Those are nice.  They're pretty forgiving, you
know.  You can always tear #stuff out and redo it.  It's a,# 

B.54:  #Yeah, yeah.#  That's not near,

A.55:  [Throat_clearing].

B.56:  like building a house or anything but,

A.57:  Right [throat_clearing].

B.58:  Yeah, those are nice.  Especially when you get done, you've got something,
you know.  I don't know, I like them.  You just sit down on --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- on the deck and do whatever.  #Have# -- 

A.61:  #I# --

B.62:  -- a barbecue or,

A.63:  -- I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a
backrest and all that stuff.  I,

B.64:  Yeah, that sounds nice.

A.65:  [Throat_clearing].

B.66:  All done by yourself, huh?

A.67:  Yeah.  #I had# --

B.68:  #Designed,# 

A.69:  -- a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete
and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts.  And, uh --

B.70:  [/Static] Yeah.

A.71:  -- and then the rest of it I just did.  A, a contractor friend helped me,
uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work but, uh, it was pretty, it was about
four or five hundred square feet.  The same size as the addition that I just
put on so.

B.72:  Yeah.  That's pretty, that's a good size deck.

A.73:  [Throat_clearing] Yeah.

B.74:  #So, yeah.  That's,#

A.75:  #It's, uh,# not that expensive.  I think it cost me three dollars a square
foot and, uh, you know, no less than that.

B.76:  Yeah.  That's not,

A.77:  Co-, cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together.

B.78:  Yeah, that's good.  That's not bad at all.  #Didn't# --

A.79:  #Yeah.#

B.80:  -- have to, th-, the wood ((may)) it got surprising as to the fact that how
much wood is, you know.  To get, to get good lumber it costs, I don't know
about Dallas, but arou-, even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at
all.  I was surprised.

A.81:  I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, #cheaper where you are.#

B.82:  #It's probably more there.#

A.83:  Well, yeah.  It probably comes from where you are.  

B.84:  [Laughter] Yeah, yeah, that --

A.85:  Most [throat_clearing].

B.86:  -- it probably does.  I, I'm not sure but,

A.87:  When I drive through that area, that's all I see is --

B.88:  [Noise] Yeah.  It's nothing but woods up here, #down here.#

A.89:  -- #pressure treated,# pressure treated lumber yards.

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  [Laughter] [throat_clearing].

B.92:  I don't, I haven't, I mean, I haven't, I used to live in Dallas.  In
Arlington, actually.

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  And, but that was just when I was a kid so I don't really know what the
cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore.  But it's, I don't know, we're
a college town so that doesn't help us out any.

A.95:  Right.  East Texas.

B.96:  (( )) We have,  gas is a dollar t-, dollar twelve a gallon, so --

A.97:  Huh.

B.98:  -- that's probably about what you're paying so.

A.99:  Yeah, my current project is a walkway which I'm building around the house
and out to the backyard to, uh, you know, digging it out and laying sand and
putting, uh, pavers on top of that so.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  That's a #lot easier.#

B.102:  #You've# got something going all the time.
