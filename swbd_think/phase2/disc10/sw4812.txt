=========================================================================

A.1:  [Noise] [talking]  So how do you feel about it?

B.2:  Uh, I, I don't see any problem with, with testing for random drugs.

@A.3:  Yeah.  I, I, myself, almost, uh, am in favor of it.  Uh, I work at
Honeywell and I went through a, a pretty, I don't know, I went through a,
standard drug testing thing before I, I was brought on.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  I think that's pretty standard.  At least at Honeywell it is.  Uh, I think
it's important to insure the quality and, and, uh, I don't know, almost the
goodness of character.  #You know# --

B.6:  #Yeah.#

A.7:  -- that kind of thing.  Where do you work?

B.8:  Uh, well I'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie #Mellon.#

A.9:  #Oh, okay.#  #Oh, okay.#  

B.10:  #And I, I# just came from Saint Paul.

A.11:  Huh.

B.12:  Uh, interviewing with Three M.  

A.13:  Oh, great.

B.14:  And, uh, they have a policy for, uh, testing.  If you, if they make you an
offer, then they'll test you right before you start.

A.15:  Right.

B.16:  And I guess the only [lipsmack] drawback I can see to, to drug testing is
in, in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some, uh, sort
of false positive result --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- then there #could# --

A.19:  #Yeah.#

B.20:  -- be some sort of problem.  But i-, 

A.21:  Yeah.  And that, that definitely happens, you know.  I mean those, the drug
tests, sure they're accurate but there's always that margin of error.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And that's, that's something to be aware of.  Another thing is, a lot of
times, you know, they aren't that accurate.  They aren't that sensitive.  Like
if you're on a prescription drug of some kind, you know, what are they going
to do about that [laughter].

B.24:  Yeah [laughter].

A.25:  You know, I was on a couple of different prescription drugs when I was
tested for Honeywell and, uh, uh, you know, I know they didn't catch that or
else they would have said something.  Uh, I'm sure they screen for just a
particular few types.  Although the literature they give with you says yeah we
do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  Uh, I don't know.  What, what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon?  

B.28:  Uh, electrical engineering.

A.29:  Oh, okay.  Great.  Uh, yeah, I'm a graduate student at U C F in Florida.
University of Central Florida.

B.30:  Oh, #((wow)).#

A.31:  #And# this is actually a [laughter] an internship up here.  

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  But, uh, they, uh, even for interns they, they do the whole random drug or
the whole drug testing thing, so.

B.34:  They test you, uh, before they, before you start or before #you even# --

A.35:  #Right.#

B.36:  -- interview or,

A.37:  Uh, they essentially, no I sure don't {talking to someone else}, {resumes
talking to B} uh, they essentially, uh, they essentially, uh, made me the
offer and then, and then, uh, did the drug testing thing after that.  So, uh,
it was one of those things where you go through the, the general battery of
all their tests and, and then, they essentially give you the offer --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and then at that point they'll, they'll ask you to go to a drug testing
and things like that.

B.40:  Oh.

A.41:  So, uh, there's some noise on this end.  I'm actually in a mall calling so
[laughter].

B.42:  Oh [laughter].  

A.43:  You probably wondered, huh.  #But,# 

B.44:  #Yeah.# Wh-, what happens if you were to fail?  Then do they give you like
one ch-, one more chance or two more #chances?#

A.45:  #Yes.# That's a good question.  I believe from what I remember of the
literature they gave, uh, if you fail I believe they give you one more chance.
They probably give you a chance to explain yourself --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- and then maybe give you another chance to go through it.  But, uh, you
know, once again, those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a
proportion of people who do fail, you know.  But, uh, ((wha-,)) are you
working right now anywhere or,

B.48:  Uh, no.

A.49:  #Okay.#

B.50:  #I'm just# about to finish my Master's in May #and, uh# --

A.51:  #Oh, okay.  Great.#

B.52:  -- just interviewing with companies right now.

A.53:  Yeah.  That was the first time I'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening,
you know.  Was, was going to Honeywell.  A friend of mine is also a doctoral
student down there.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  And he's doing an internship with I B M.  

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  And, uh, they, basically, uh, did the same exact thing.  Uh, we both got
our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug testing
{mispronounced} at the same time.  So, one of those things where we went
through a kind of an identical process.  #But, uh,# 

B.58:  #Did, do# they test you at, right now, at work too?  

A.59:  No, no.  #That's# --

B.60:  #Okay.#

A.61:  -- one thing they don't do is, is drug testing while you're on the job.
Uh, I think, I think the unwritten rule is, yeah, expect it but they don't do
it.

B.62:  Oh [laughter].

A.63:  You know, so.  That's good I guess.  I don't know.  I mean, I, uh, I have
gone to a couple of parties since, since that time and while I don't do any
drugs myself, I've seen some people who work there, uh, you know, smoking a
joint or whatever.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And, uh, you know, that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up,
you know.  But no, they don't, they don't really do that.  So.

B.66:  Wow.  Is it formal policy that they said they might test?

A.67:  Yeah [/noise] [/talking].
