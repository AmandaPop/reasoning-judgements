REMARKS:        There is a noise on A that sounds like somebody is dragging
something across the floor.

===========================================================================

B.1:  All rightie.

A.2:  [Noise] Okay.  Do you have a budget that you go on?

@B.3:  Yeah.  I sure do.  Uh, I have, it's pretty much a ledger sheet and I just
write down e-, all my bills, how much I'm going to have to pay and I do it per
paycheck for me --

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  -- which is every other week.  

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  Uh, I mean I include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments
to credit card payments, you know, everything.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  And it tends to work out pretty well that way.  I can anticipate, you know,
a little better.  I usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually
comes in, I go ahead and fill in the actual amount.

A.10:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.11:  That way I know how much pocket change I'm going to have left [laughter]
#at the end of the month# --

A.12:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.13:  -- or at the end of the paycheck anyway.

A.14:  Uh-huh [sniffing].

B.15:  So that works okay for me.

A.16:  Uh-huh.  Well, my bills I usually know approximately how much they're going
to be.

B.17:  Right.

A.18:  Each month they g-, are more or less just about the same, you know.  

B.19:  Uh-huh, #same here.#

A.20:  #Uh, very# seldom are they any different.  And then, uh, like for groceries
and everything, we try to put, like, two hundred and fifty dollars in a little
can [laughter] in the kitchen [sniffing] --

B.21:  Uh-huh.

A.22:  -- and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with.

B.23:  Oh, okay.

A.24:  And then we put our receipts in there, you know, and usually that's enough.

B.25:  Uh-huh.  

A.26:  And, uh, but I don't have any, you know, small children to have anything
extra come up, you know, like, uh, running to the doctor or something like
that with them.

B.27:  Right.  Luckily I don't either.  I mean, you know, 

A.28:  [Noise].

B.29:  maybe my cat would get sick but, I mean, usually that's not so much that it
would throw me off [noise].

A.30:  Yeah, yeah, right.  In fact, I did have to take my dog to the vet the other
day #[laughter].#

B.31:  #But you [laughter] so you know what# I'm saying, #yeah.#  

A.32:  #Yeah.#  Tha-, that, it's worse than having a kid, huh?

B.33:  I, sometimes it can be.

A.34:  #Yeah.#

B.35:  #Sometimes# it can be.  I guess the worst thing I've ever had come out is
like car maintenance kinds of things.

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  But I do try to build in a little extra money each month to, to be able to
do that type of thing #so.#

A.38:  #Yeah,# uh, I'm not working right now.  I worked for P I E and then, uh,
they went bankrupt so --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  -- I just went ahead and took my early pension.

B.41:  Oh, uh-huh.

A.42:  But I only get that once a month.

B.43:  Oh, that's tough.

A.44:  Yeah [laughter].

B.45:  My roommate only gets paid once a month and --

A.46:  Yeah.  So,

B.47:  -- that last week's pretty lean generally [laughter] speaking so.

A.48:  Yeah.  So, you know, I really have to try to budget, that I don't go over
that amount, you know, each month.

B.49:  Right.  I, for, for years got paid once a month and, and in ways I liked it
because I could go ahead and pay all my bills at once.

A.50:  Uh-huh.

B.51:  There's always one or two stragglers that usually they were, for me it
worked out that they were the smaller ones --

A.52:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.53:  -- but I would pay all of them at one sitting and I would know okay, you
can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that
is it.

A.54:  Yeah, right.

B.55:  And, and ((it)) worked okay for me.

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  I don't know.

A.58:  #And,# 

B.59:  #Right# now I, I'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt, I think as
everybody is #and so,#

A.60:  #Oh, yeah.#  Right now it's terrible isn't it?  

B.61:  It's, yeah, it's really bad.  

A.62:  [Noise] Yeah.

B.63:  But, uh, it's going pretty well and I've got a real good plan mapped out
here, #so.#

A.64:  #Uh-huh.#  I also like long-term Christmas club be-, you know.  I used to
belong to a Christmas club, last year I didn't.

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  Then, so then, naturally, Christmas comes along and that puts you behind
too, you know.  So this year, now I have them taking out fifty dollars a month
#out of my# --

B.67:  #Oh that's,#

A.68:  -- checking account for my Christmas club.

B.69:  Yeah.  

A.70:  So I figure, you know, that's going to help some.

B.71:  That'll cover your gifts come Christmas time.  #That'll, yeah,# 

A.72:  #Yeah, right,# [noise] you know.

B.73:  That'll be good, yeah most people are spending three or four months di-,
you know, at least, #digging out after Christmas so.#

A.74:  #Right, right.#  #And I'm ta-,# 

B.75:  #Yeah, I, I was# pretty fortunate this Christmas I didn't get in debt, so.

A.76:  Oh, that's good.  I'm taking like, uh, sewing lessons to try to learn how
to sew better than what I can --

B.77:  Uh-huh.

A.78:  -- so I won't have to go out and buy the ready-made clothes anymore.  

B.79:  Oh, uh-huh.  It's so rare you hear anybody doing that #any longer
[laughter].#

A.80:  #I know.# I even bought myself a ((Surgery)), you know, and I just love it.
I haven't learned everything to do on it yet but I figure that will help me
save --

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  -- you know.  

B.83:  My, uh, roommate does sew some and, and, uh, i-, she hasn't sewed anything
in a long time but I, I'm sure that she could pick it up again.

A.84:  [Noise].

B.85:  My mother always sewed.  She tried to teach me when I was young but --

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  -- not interested #[laughter].#

A.88:  #Yeah.  Well,# see, some people are, some aren't #because# --

B.89:  #Yeah.#

A.90:  -- I have some sisters, I have three sisters and [noise] none of those are
really interested in sewing.

B.91:  Yeah.  But that's a real good way to save money, 

A.92:  [Noise].

B.93:  though by doing that.

A.94:  Yeah, and then I can also, you know, do some crafts and sell those at
garage sales.

B.95:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.96:  So, which I've been doing.  

B.97:  Well, that's a good way to, to make a little extra money.

A.98:  Uh-huh.

B.99:  Well, this is another way that I'm making a little extra money so that was,
you know, nice that I tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my
first call.

A.100:  Oh, really?

B.101:  Yeah.

A.102:  Oh.  

B.103:  I had not, uh, done #I, I guess today# --

A.104:  #Well, have you called?#

B.105:  -- today's my first day that I #could# --

A.106:  #Oh.# 

B.107:  -- even do it.

A.108:  Oh, it is?

B.109:  Yeah, you beat me to the punch, #here [laughter].#

A.110:  #Oh, well, that, that's nice# [laughter] you know.

B.111:  I, I was about to call to get, to see if I could get on with somebody, 
so --

A.112:  Uh-huh.

B.113:  -- so that was great.

A.114:  Yeah.  Well I guess that's about all I can talk to about budgets.  When I
was working, I, uh, bought a bond a month out of my, you know, they
automatically took it out of #my# --

B.115:  #Yeah.#

A.116:  -- out of my payroll.

B.117:  Yeah.  I take, have some money taken it and put in a Four Oh One K,
