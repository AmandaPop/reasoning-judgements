============================================================================

A.1:  [Clicking] Have you had that experience recently?

B.2:  Recently, I can't really say recently.  But I think about, uh, about a year
ago, uh, I bought a product from some company down at, uh, in Atlanta,
Georgia.  I believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers.  These,
like these juice machines #and, uh# --

A.3:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.4:  -- the, uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it
looked, you know, perfectly okay but I found that, uh, it was made of some
material which actually ended up rusting --

A.5:  #Oh.#

B.6:  -- #uh,# after, even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty
after about, uh, three weeks of use.  And I don't think it was my fault
because i-, I, you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning
it but, uh, it was really, uh, it was, I had to send it back after like, you
know, the third week because I realized it was like, it was not, something was
very, very wrong with the blade.  Uh, what about you?

A.7:  Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service.

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  I don't feel like that's as big a problem.  I've had a few answering
machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with
them working correctly.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.  

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But that's it.  But that's, that's probably the worst.  My daughter has a
charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed.  Uh, James Avery.  I don't know
if you have that up there but it, it's a very good company.  #That# --

B.16:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.17:  -- sells sterling silver things and --

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  -- uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money
into it by now --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when
she stood up, it caught and broke and we took it back and they said oh, this
was just obviously yanked.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  This was yanked.  I mean they were so rude about it.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  And so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well it's not
guaranteed.  And I said, well put it on because apparently nothing's
guaranteed so do it anyway.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  So we got the kind we wanted and I was really disappointed with that.  I
felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and I
called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice.  And I said my
goodness, I said you've been very nice, what's your name.  And she told me and
I said well I really appreciate it.  I said there seems to be a big attitude
problem in that,

B.30:  [Sniffing].

A.31:  store and it turned out she was the assistant manager #so,# 

B.32:  #Well# at least your talking to somebody who counts [laughter].  

A.33:  Right.  So I felt kind of good about that, you know.  #I didn't# --

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  -- even know the person's name that had given {mispronounced} me the hard
time or anything --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- but I just felt like, well at least I did something.  Maybe they'll fix
it.  They might work on that, you know.

B.38:  Right, #right.#

A.39:  #But# I find attitudes are more of a problem.  Service is more of a
problem.

B.40:  I find, up here in the northeast, we have, uh, well w-, we have these mail
order companies like L L Bean and, uh, they are famous for, I guess, having
really top-notch service.  They've got, #uh# --

A.41:  #Really.#

B.42:  -- I mean I've, I've, I, I have friends and family who order from them
because you can, you can literally, I've heard stories where you can
literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half,
and even after, like eighteen months of, you know, reasonably satisfactory
use, they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly, no questions
asked, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it
anymore.  Uh, they'll, they'll actually do things like this.  I mean they're
really, they, they go-, bend over backwards service wise for you.  I've, uh --

A.43:  That's really great.

B.44:  -- I've found also a lot of companies nowadays, have, they have eight
hundred numbers you can call.  I guess if, if you call the e-, any eight
hundred number, uh, if, you, you can call up e-, any eight hundred number
directory assistance, and you can get, uh, the eight hundred number of the
customer service support line for a number of companies.  And, um, actually
I've tried that with a few companies lately.  And they've, most of them have
been pretty good, but I, I was, one reason why, I, like I buy a lot of
clothing through mail order is that, uh, if you buy through Bean or though,
uh, I guess Bean's, one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in, uh, I
guess it's Wisconsin somewhere.  They, they are, uh, they're very good 
#about# --

A.45:  #Huh.#

B.46:  -- uh, insur-, like the customer is always right and you know, no matter
how crabby you might be over the phone, they are very understanding and, uh,
they usually get, you know, they, they make things are, they ma- make sure
things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise.

A.47:  That's really good.  It use to be like that.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  But,

B.50:  #[Laughter].#

A.51:  #I don't# think most places are like that anymore.

B.52:  Yeah.  Well I think, I guess nowadays with the, uh, with the economy the
way it is, I guess, there was a, there was a story on the news tonight about
how, because a lot of companies are, uh, you know, things are getting rough
out there, there's a lot of, you know, the morale among employees tends to go
down and that, in turn, like, you know,
