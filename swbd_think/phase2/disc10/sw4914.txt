A.1:  Why don't you start this time?

B.2:  [Laughter] Okay.  Uh, let's see.  I have a Macintosh Two C I.  And, uh, I'm
a [bird_squawk] graduate student in cognitive psychology.  Uh, and so I use it
basically, to run all my statistics and write up reports and research and that
kind of good stuff.  And I'd be dead without it [laughter].

@A.3:  Yeah.  I'm in the same position.  I started on a Commodore in nineteen
eighty-six.  Uh, and moved up in eighty-eight to an I B M system and I'm
running on an I B M clone right now [sigh] under Windows.

B.4:  #Uh-huh.#

A.5:  #Which,# basically, is the same thing, #I think [laughter].#

B.6:  #[Laughter].#  

A.7:  And, uh, I've used it, also I do tremendous amounts of word processing.  I
work in radio but I'm #required# --

B.8:  #Huh.#

A.9:  -- to do a lot of, you know, journalistic writing and that.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  Uh, so I do almost everything now in word and in some other, you know, word
processing system and, uh, use it to gather news and information and put it
all together for something that's usable.  So I've had my computer, I've, I,
I've found what's happened is that I can't write anymore on paper, #you know
[laughter].#

B.12:  #[Laughter].#

A.13:  Because I type so fast now that any, it's distracting to try and write by
hand because it takes too long.

B.14:  Exactly.  Exactly.  And on, I like to like go back and reedit things as
soon as I write it and, and, you know, you can't do that very well with, uh, a
piece of paper and #pencil# --

A.15:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.16:  -- you know, cause it takes so much longer to change things around and move
whole chunks and all #this, that,# 

A.17:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.18:  and the other.

A.19:  And, of course, you know, I also run a bulletin board --

B.20:  Huh.

A.21:  -- from here.  And I'm involved in (( )) Net.

B.22:  Oh, okay.

A.23:  Uh, #I'm the,#

B.24:  #[Laughter].#

A.25:  the net coordinator up here for western and central New York.

B.26:  Oh, wow.

A.27:  Part of Net Two Sixty here.  It's got, we have eighty nodes in this city
alone.

B.28:  Wow #[laughter].#

A.29:  #So we,# we try and get everybody together and that way it, you know, you
can exchange mail between them and #you don't# --

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- have to call them.

B.32:  Right #[laughter].#

A.33:  #[Laughter]#  And I just got into the w-, (( )) Nets now has a thing where
we can get in with the Inter-Net.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  So, I #found out,# 

B.36:  #Yeah.#  I've started seeing some Inter-Net postings from (( )) Net and
stuff like that.

A.37:  Yeah.  I, it's where I found out about this through Comp, DCom, Telecom.

B.38:  Yeah, yeah.

A.39:  Uh, and I submit some messages on there.  I, it's made things s-, so much
easier.  It's amazing though that i-, in nineteen eighty-six we were all doing
like three hundred bawd.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And, of course, you know, that's like ancient history and #you think,# 

B.42:  #[Laughter].#

A.43:  my God, it was only like five, six years ago #[laughter].#

B.44:  #Yeah, yeah.#  #[laughter].#

A.45:  #[Laughter]# And, and here's what we have now.  I mean, what's, in five
years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with
these things.

B.46:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, if we ever get any sort of, uh, I S D N
running, nationally, it'll be really incredible #[laughter].#

A.47:  #Huh.#

B.48:  If they have the amount of data we can exchange.

A.49:  Well, that's what ((Good Gore's)) working on.

B.50:  Right.  Yeah.  Well that and he's talking about expanding the, the
Inter-Net as it stands now.  Upgrading the backbone.  Stuff like that.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  Uh, so.  You know, it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere.

A.53:  Well, I see the phone companies are working on getting into information
services.  #So we're going# --

B.54:  #Uh-huh.#

A.55:  -- to have a glut of things.  Everyone, I think we're going to see another
revolution in computers but I think the reason why it didn't work the first
time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer to do all these
things.  Uh, when in fact at the time, you know, back in the early eighties,
uh, and mid-eighties, you know, people didn't.  The technology wasn't to the
point where it was something that could be easily learned for everyone.  But
now we have the things like the Mac and Windows and other things where all you
got to do is point at something and #push a button.#

B.56:  #Uh-huh.#  Oh, yeah.

A.57:  And I think that the technology is catching up to the point where we're
going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier for people to
understand how to do these things.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  So I'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will
be a little more friendly to the end user.

B.60:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, I think what's going to happen is it's going to sneak
into the consumer market, uh, through the television and through the cable
industry and telephone industry.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  Uh, I was just reading in the WASHINGTON POST this morning.  They've got an
article in the business section, uh, about how A T and T has just announced
that they plan to offer, uh, cable T V systems with five hundred channels by
nineteen ninety-four.  Uh [laughter] #you know.#

A.63:  #Well, they're# working on that.  I'm a satellite dish owner and we've been
fighting like mad to have these suckers reregulated, you know #[laughter].
Because,# 

B.64:  #[Laughter].#

A.65:  of the, uh, because they've stomped on us.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  And so now what's happening is, the phone companies want to get into cable
and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  And the cable industry now wants to get into the telephone #industry
[laughter]# --

B.70:  #Right [laughter].#

A.71:  -- through these personal communication things.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  But I think everyone's working now.  I, I mean I'm seeing this, we're going
to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides 
and --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- and everything else.  And ordering systems.  They have this thing called
T V,
