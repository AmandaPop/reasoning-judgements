A.1:  [Clicking] (( )).

@B.2:  Yeah, uh, so the thing is I traveled to, uh, I traveled all over, uh,
South America a few years ago, when I was in college and, uh, picked up a lot
of history and, uh, and, uh, a lot of cultural knowledge from that experience.
Uh, have you had any experience with it?  Or have you read or have you any
interest in it?

A.3:  Well, I've, I've spent, uh, I spent three years in the Orient.  But I, uh,
as, how shall I say it, living on their level but and, but I've never been,
uh, to South America, so [lipsmack].

B.4:  Well, it was interesting for me.  I hadn't taken much, uh, history or any
classes or anything on it at school and, uh, the person I was traveling with
knew a lot about it.  Uh, and she kind of explained [sigh] a lot of things
that were going on there but, uh, uh, it was interesting to, to see a lot of,
uh, the history and how they've sort of developed into some of the patterns
that [noise] each of the countries have been through when I was traveling
around down there.

A.5:  Th-, the thing that, that I, uh, [lipsmack] I guess I could, could say,

B.6:  [Noise].

A.7:  {Pause} that I know how none, how America comes across to other countries
from my, uh, time in the Orient, uh --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and I know that, uh, so I, I guess I can extrap-, it a little,
extrapolate a little bit and say that, that, uh, might makes right and money
makes right and, uh, uh, I'm sure that the perception in other places is that
these guys are a bunch of bullies.  Uh [lipsmack],

B.10:  Yeah, I think that, uh, I think that particularly applies down there.  Uh,
i-, there was a perception particularly in Brazil and Argentina [noise] that
the United States had, was really to blame for a lot of the economic
oppression that was,

A.11:  [Noise].

B.12:  suffered down there,

A.13:  [Sigh].

B.14:  because, uh, something like after the war, we gave all sorts of special
trade preferences to Europe to #help# --

A.15:  #Uh-huh.#

B.16:  -- them recover and completely ignored the South American beef and, and
what other industry they had down there and they suffered greatly for that.
Even though they had these great products for export, y-, it was sort of the
United States that was kind of choosing their fate, you know,

A.17:  [Sigh].

B.18:  who would make it and who wouldn't.

A.19:  Well, I, I and yet I can see part of that because [sniffing] uh, how shall
I say it, my impression of Latins has been governed by when I grew in
California and certainly here you are in Texas.  Uh, uh, my impression of
Latins was, was totally, uh, colored by the fact that I, there were a lot of
uneducated Mexicans and, uh, I think most Americans, you know, all the
stereotypes are that, the, they call them banana republics and things like
that so #that# --

B.20:  #Yeah.#

A.21:  -- the stereotypes are that, that they don't know what, they're not very
well educated.  When I was, the, the flip side of that is that, uh, in my
twenties, uh, well when I was in [swallowing] in Hong Kong,

B.22:  [Noise].

A.23:  I found, uh, uh, I, I, met some people who were totally white, blond haired
people from, I think it was Uruguay --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- and, uh, so they told me a little about, they said well this is, you
know, it, it's very European country and, uh, then I met, uh, after I got
married, I met a woman from, uh, Mexico City whose vocabulary, she didn't
speak English at all tha-, her vocabulary was incredible, even though her
pronunciation was, uh --

B.26:  Huh.

A.27:  -- a little rough.

B.28:  Yeah [noise].

A.29:  And I talk-, and I heard her give a speech one time and I, I, uh, she was,
got all over me because, uh, she said you're, you're equating the fact that my
accent, uh, that I have a Spanish accent with no vocabulary.  And so, I guess
what I'm [inhaling] leading up to is to say that I'm sure they're getting very
tired of us not taking them seriously.

B.30:  Yeah, uh, in fact a lot of those same sort of stereotypes impressions I had
before I traveled around down there and one of the things I learned was that
there is an incredible amount of diversity, e-, especially from country to
country but even within countries, you know, you, you've got, uh, uh,
different races.  Uh, in, in the Andean countries, you have a big, uh, Indian
race, you know --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- an-, and Mexico has a lot of that and that's why, you know, you get sort
of the Spanish Mexicans who, who aren't really as common that you see in the
United States and, and the, uh, the, the poor, uh, ethnic, uh, you know,
Indian, uh, uh, races and cultures and everything and there's a, there's a big
mixture and then like Brazil has [sniffing] a lot of af-, people of African
descent and all different races and [sniffing] then you, you deal with a lot
of issues that are sort of even a microcosm of, of the racial issues in the
United States where like people in Argentina,
