============================================================================

A.1:  Okay [static].  Uh, [breathing] let me see.  Unfortunately, we are not much
into recycling.

@B.2:  Uh-huh.

A.3:  We don't, we don't do enough.  I know we don't so [noise].  Uh, although
lately I've been, uh, a friend of mine that I spend a lot of time with does
recycle quite a bit and it's, it's, it's, uh, [laughter] interesting to watch
some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me,
uh, where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes [/noise] to my house
but I can kind of tell it bothers her so,

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  just unconsciously I've, I've stopped buying a lot of, uh, uh, paper
plates and paper cups and I don't do that anymore.  I don't know why, I just
don't [laughter].  I just, just from socializing with her so.

B.6:  How do you, how, uh, is recycling done in your community?  Is,

A.7:  It really, it, there's not a whole lot, there really isn't.  Uh,
[child_talking] I know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio, each, each
house has, they're, they're given three baskets --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and they put them out on a certain day of the week --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- and each, uh, home does participate but we really don't have anything,
uh, close in this area that, that do anything.  And, and some of the
communities that do, the residents are having to pay to participate in it.

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  Which really doesn't make sense.

B.14:  Right.  Over here, they, uh, have several private companies that you can
take, uh, recycled,

A.15:  [Child_talking].

B.16:  materials to.  But, uh, if you want to take them all to one place, they
have, uh, the first Saturday of every month, they have certain places that you
can drop them off.  That's what I do.  Uh, and I, I recycle aluminum, glass,
uh, newspapers.

A.17:  Yeah, that's good.

B.18:  So it's nice to have, you know, one place that you can take them all to
instead of driving #the glass to one place and,# 

A.19:  #Yeah, yeah.  That's another thing.#  You have to [child_talking] --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- go to different places to do that.

B.22:  Right.  So it's, so that's nice.  It would be, it would be really nice if
they, uh, came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a
bill in Tucson about that, but, uh, uh, it didn't go through.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  But I heard that most homes that do participate in that are having
to pay a monthly fee to do that.  Which, uh, I don't know, it just doesn't
make sense to me.

B.24:  Right.  I guess what they, what they were talking about here was, uh, was
reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- or something, you know.

A.27:  Yeah.

B.28:  Uh, so I guess that's one option.  

A.29:  Yeah.  That's good, #that's good.#

B.30:  #I guess# one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too.
#Like, uh# --

A.31:  #Uh-huh.#

B.32:  -- have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods, they have this
little number now that tells #what# --

A.33:  #Huh.#

B.34:  -- kind of plastic it is?

A.35:  No.

B.36:  Yeah, I guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds
that you can't recycle, you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler.

A.37:  Oh, I didn't know that.

B.38:  Yeah.  So now they're like marking, uh, they're, I don't know, there's six,
seven, eight different kind of plastics and they, they mark on the bottom what
kind it is.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  So I guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're, 

A.41:  [Barking].

B.42:  they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of
different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one
kind of plastic so that --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- that makes it easier I guess.

A.45:  Well, that's good.  I, I'm, you know, unfortunately Garland doesn't have,
doesn't, they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that [barking]
or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility 
bills --

B.46:  Right.

A.47:  -- or your, uh, garbage collection and they haven't, you know, talked about
doing something like that [/barking].

B.48:  Where does your friend go to to recycle?

A.49:  She lives in Garland and I'm not sure where, what she does.  But she's, uh,
oh she's ve-, very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery
store [child_talking].

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products [laughter]
in her house.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  Uh, and just a lot of things I've [laughter] learned off of her that, to
start doing.  And she does make a lot of sense.

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  Just her whole house is [laughter] like wow.

B.56:  I guess that's how it gets passed on.  You know, when one person, #you
hear# --

A.57:  #Yeah.#

B.58:  -- from another person and then, uh, and then you, and then you pass it on.

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  It seems to be catching on, uh, slowly but surely, I guess [laughter].

A.61:  Yeah.  And, uh, my little boy has, watches a program that was really neat.
I sat and watched him.  You know the Barney?  You know the little, I don't
know if you know the little character Barney.

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  They had one, uh, on that kind of, type of thing and how children can, can
do that and how to save water b-, when you brush your teeth in water and it's
really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  #Wow, that's cute.#

A.65:  #[Laughter].#

B.66:  That's neat, yeah.  #When you,# 

A.67:  #And keep# the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing.  He's
really caught on so that's really neat [/static] [/child_talking].

B.68:  Well, when you start early, I guess,
