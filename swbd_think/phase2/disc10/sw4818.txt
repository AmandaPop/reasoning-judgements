=========================================================================

B.1:  Uh, well I'm just really excited about it because [laughter] I'm
graduating from college next month and hope to be buying a car sometime
[laughter] in the future.

A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  So [noise], so hopefully, uh, maybe, do you have any good advice?  Do you
have a car or,

A.4:  Uh, yeah, I do have a car.

B.5:  Uh-huh.

A.6:  Right now I have sort of a sporty car.  It's a Subaru that is, it's called
an X T Six.  I don't think they make them anymore.  #I think# --

B.7:  #Uh-huh.#

A.8:  -- I have the last year.  And it's one of these Japanese cars that run
without needing many repairs.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  Uh, my advice about cars is, uh, get a good engine.  Get something that
goes.  Not because I'm a speed freak, uh --

B.11:  Uh-huh.

A.12:  -- something because if you want to get on a highway, you don't want to
step on the gas and, and say come on, come on [laughter].

B.13:  That's true, that's true.

A.14:  I do, you know, they make jokes about women picking out the color but I
really do like to have a decent sized #[laughter] engine in my car.#

B.15:  #[Laughter].#

A.16:  And I have a six cylinder and it does goes when I tell it to.  And, and I
just like the looks of a kind of sporty car.

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  Uh, I think my car needs are going to change.  I had very small children
and I was saddled with a station wagon that I never wanted.

B.19:  Oh.

A.20:  Uh, I was told that, you know, it will hold groceries and all this stuff.
Well, the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon --

B.21:  That's true.  #They do.  My# --

A.22:  -- #you know and# -- 

B.23:  -- mom has one.

A.24:  -- and, you know, I wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or dog in it
and I didn't.  So when I got a new car, I got a sporty little car.

B.25:  Uh-huh.

A.26:  And my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore
and they sit in the back and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller
than I am and --

B.27:  Oh.

A.28:  -- every time I go over a bump he crashes his head because --

B.29:  Oh, no.

A.30:  -- you know, these cars have, they're backseats but they're kind of toy
backseats [laughter].

B.31:  Yeah, yeah.

A.32:  So, I think, should I get another car, uh, much to my chagrin, it will have
to be something more boxy --

B.33:  Uh-huh.

A.34:  -- and, you know, practical again.  So, this, I gu-, I guess this is my
reprieve and I guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy
because at some later date you'll have to get something #more practical
[laughter].#

B.35:  #[Laughter] That's# great advice.  I'm so glad I got to talk to #you
[laughter].#

A.36:  #[Laughter].#

B.37:  That's good.  That's what I needed to hear [laughter].  Yeah, I guess, I'm
looking for, uh, something kind of small because it's only me.  And I'm a
small person.  I'm only about five, one [laughter].

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  So, uh, and I'd like to get something made in the United States so I would
look for that first.  But, if it turns out that a better price is from, say
Japan, like the Subaru, then I, I would go for that.  Because the most
important thing is price [laughter] because,

A.40:  Well, you know, the more I think of it [noise], you know, with what's going
on in the world nowadays --

B.41:  Uh-huh.

A.42:  -- I think the next car, I would try to buy an American one.

B.43:  Would you really?

A.44:  Yeah.  #I think so.#

B.45:  #Yeah.#

A.46:  It's, you know, Toyotas and all those, the-, they're nice cars but, you
know, surely there's an American car.  I, #I'd love to# --

B.47:  #You would think so.#

A.48:  -- check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new, newly made American
car.

B.49:  Uh-huh.  Actually, I heard really good things about them and, uh, it's
funny because I just spent, last weekend I was down in Washington D C visiting
my sister and they are everywhere down there.  It's amazing because you hardly
see any of them on the road,

A.50:  [Noise].

B.51:  here in Philadelphia but I saw about ten in one weekend.  And my sister had
gone to the dealership and she was really impressed.  She, uh,

A.52:  [Noise].

B.53:  the [laughter] one thing that really impressed her which sounds kind of
weird, but they actually have women salesmen.  It's weird because have you
ever seen a woman car salesman?

A.54:  Oh, yeah.  I have.

B.55:  Really.  Because I was surprised.  But and she said they were really nice
and one good thing about the car is it's really hard to dent.  You know, when
you're driving a car #and you go in a,# 

A.56:  #[Noise] Is it really?#

B.57:  Yeah, you know, most cars in a parking lot like a shopping cart hits it or
a car door hits it and you have all your dents.  Well, the lady took a hammer
to this car and it didn't dent.  #She was# --

A.58:  #Huh.#

B.59:  -- like smashing it and it didn't --

A.60:  Really.

B.61:  -- (( )) or something.  I don't what it is but,

A.62:  How was the pricing?

B.63:  It's actually supposed to be really good.  The smaller ones, I think,
around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand.

A.64:  Oh, that's, #that's not horrible at all.#

B.65:  #So they look really nice.#

A.66:  That's quite good nowadays.  

B.67:  Yeah, yeah, so.  I don't know, maybe it's something to think about.
Because they're supposed to be completely made in the United States.  Not one
of these deals where it says it's made in the United States but the engine is
really made in Japan.  #And all the parts are made in Japan.#

A.68:  #Parts are made in different places.#  #Right.#

B.69:  #Right.#

A.70:  I wonder who makes the, the Geos becau-,

B.71:  I think that's Chevrolet.  

A.72:  Is it?  

B.73:  Uh-huh.

A.74:  Because they're so cute.  The Geo Storm is #adorable.#

B.75:  #That is# really nice.  That's true.  I don't know anything them at all.
Do you know anyone who has one?

A.76:  No, #no I don't [noise].#

B.77:  #I know.#

A.78:  In fact, I, I sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it
felt a little tinny, you know.

B.79:  Yeah.

A.80:  It wa-, it's a smaller, lighter car.

B.81:  Uh-huh.

A.82:  But, you know, that was years ago.  That was about four years ago when I
bought mine --

B.83:  Huh.

A.84:  -- so it may have changed.  I know on looks, I think the Storm is just
adorable little car for a single person.

B.85:  Yeah.  That is really cute, that's true.

A.86:  Huh.  

B.87:  So.

A.88:  Are, are you working yet?  

B.89:  Uh, well, I'm in R O T C, so I'll be in the Army.  

A.90:  #Uh-huh.#

B.91:  #So on active duty# so.  #Yeah.#

A.92:  #Yeah, because# I was wondering if, are you going to finance it?

B.93:  Probably, yeah.

A.94:  ((Are you))?

B.95:  Is that a good way to go?  I guess I don't (( )).

A.96:  Uh, well I have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and I,
I like to do that.

B.97:  Uh-huh.

A.98:  But there are people who can pay for it, who prefer to finance it.

B.99:  Really.

A.100:  Yeah.  It seems to me as you're paying interest, you're bound to be, end up
paying more.

B.101:  Right, #right.#

A.102:  #I guess# now you have to think about, uh, if the money in the bank will
get more interest, #uh, then, then you'll# --

B.103:  #Oh, I see.#

A.104:  -- want to finance it but if, now the banks are giving so little interest,
I imagine you might as well just pay for it, if you could.
