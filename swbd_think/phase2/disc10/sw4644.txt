music on B's side.

=========================================================================

A.1:  [Clicking] Well, uh, preferred benefits, uh, I worked for a large
corporation in the past and I think large corporations can give better
benefits than small corporations because, right now I'm working for a very
small corporation where the owner is right there and, uh, there is a lot of
profit that's coming in but when it comes to, uh, small corporations they seem
to pocket it a little bit quick, quickly, or whatever, or however you want to
say it and, uh, the benefits aren't as great when I worked for a big
corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say
okay we've got this amount of money, let's put into this plan, this plan, you
got Four Oh One K plans.  You have, uh, better vacation plans, uh, you have,
just in general, maternity leave plans --

B.2:  [Music] Uh-huh.

A.3:  -- tha-, that kind of thing.  Big corporations are able to do that versus
small corporations, uh, you know, they just don't have the money or just feel
that there isn't the need for it.  So, I've worked for both big and small so
I've had a chance to kind of take a look at, uh, the pros and cons of both.

B.4:  Right.  Well I've worked for, uh, well I worked for H and R Block here in
Massachusetts --

A.5:  Sure.

B.6:  -- for awhile.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And the only, they even hate to give out unemployment --

A.9:  Sure.  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- at the end of tax season because --

A.11:  Huh.

B.12:  -- they, you know, they're fairly, even though they're a large scale
company, they're very,

A.13:  [Noise] Sure.

B.14:  the offices, the individual offices are very small --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and now I work for the Framingham {mispronounced} school tea-, system
because I'm a teacher.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  Sure.

B.18:  And, uh, we have much better benefits, you know, in the system.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  We have a good pension plan.  Uh, let me see, we have a profit sharing plan
to a degree.

A.21:  That's pretty good for, you know, being a, a school district type program.

B.22:  Right.  And we have the eye glasses, the health care --

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  -- #and# the whole kit and caboodle because what --

A.25:  #Wow.#

B.26:  -- #they# did is they threw all the town employees in together.

A.27:  That's extremely good.  #(( ))# --

B.28:  #Yeah.  (( )).#

A.29:  -- like the small corporation that I work for.  There's no pension plan --

B.30:  Really.

A.31:  -- there's no type of, uh, savings of any sort that the company will
reimburse you for.  There's really, I think you're allowed so many times, uh,
I think two or three days a w-, a year.  It's not accumulative, type of sick
leave --

B.32:  Oh!

A.33:  -- uh, you know, things like that.  So I've been looking at big
corporations and saying, the big corporation that I've worked for in the past
had the pension plans, had the big health, health care, uh, you had your
insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a, a very
small place.  Uh, they don't have as good as insurance packages as big
corporations.  And {very faint},

B.34:  Right.  The only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and
state employees --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- have run into problems, especially the retired ones.  My father's
retired from the town of Framingham --

A.37:  Sure.

B.38:  -- and he said that they haven't gotten a, a cost of living raise --

A.39:  #No.#

B.40:  -- #in over# --

A.41:  #Yeah.#

B.42:  -- #five# years.

A.43:  Yeah.  #Yeah.#

B.44:  #And# he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being
retired #and# --

A.45:  #Uh-huh.#

B.46:  -- but I hear that bill is in the Senate right now and #it's, hopefully# --

A.47:  #Sure, sure.#

B.48:  -- will go through.

A.49:  Yeah, yeah.

B.50:  But, uh, you know, I think the schools are at, where the schools isn't just
the school system --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- and not just the teachers.  They took in the whole town plus all #you
know,# 

A.53:  #Is it# a union?

B.54:  Uh, we have the teachers union --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- which helps out a lot, but the town of Framingham pays the benefits 
and --

A.57:  Oh, that's pretty good.

B.58:  -- that's all the town workers, water and sewer --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and where it's a very large town, it's actually, should be a city but
they kept it a town.

A.61:  Sure.

B.62:  Uh, where it's extremely large, they were able to offer a little bit more
which #was# --

A.63:  #Yeah.#

B.64:  -- really great because we don't have to pay a mayor #[laughter].# 

A.65:  #Uh-huh, yeah.# Yeah, I know what you mean and that's true.  I mean, yo-,
i-, it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that
position, sure.  #Yeah.#

B.66:  #Right,# because of most of our, you know, the town employees, as far as,
uh, electoral positions, are part-time.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  So it works out good [laughter] because #we# --

A.69:  #Sure.# 

B.70:  -- reap the benefits of it --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- and, uh, but as far as shopping for a job, I'd rather shop for the
benefits than the salary.

A.73:  Well, that's it, you know, and, and I've kind of looked around, uh, at
that, uh, too.  Because, uh, salary wise I don't think I'm making as much with
a big corporation because I think when you look at big corps or large, I'm
talking like hugh companies like Three M, uh, I'm, uh, Honeywell, uh, Texas
Instruments #[laughter]# --

B.74:  #Right [laughter].#

A.75:  -- I know people that are, that have vacation times, and bene-, benefits
that I wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation.  You bring it up to the
owner and it's like come on, you know.  Partly it's because the owner wants to
keep getting richer and richer.

B.76:  Right [/music] [noise].

A.77:  And, and, of course, when it's a small corporation, it also wants to expand
so that money is spent [/clicking],
