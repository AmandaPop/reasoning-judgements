======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, would you, uh, like to begin or would you like me to start?

B.2:  Uh, oh, I can start.  

A.3:  Okay.  

@B.4:  I, I think one of the, the biggest, uh, improvements in women is that
finally you're starting to see them get into, uh, management --

A.5:  Yes.  

B.6:  -- and you're seeing them, uh, get, uh, elected to, uh, [static] political
offices.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  Uh, not near enough.  I know there's still a long way to go especially in
top management [static].

A.9:  Yes, I agree.  

B.10:  You're not seeing, you know, looking at T I, you see them in management,
but you're not seeing them up there as V P -s.

A.11:  Right.  

B.12:  And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City, and I know the
company that she was with, uh, the women didn't h-, have near the positions,
the levels that the men attorneys had.

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  And were not, uh, given the same respect.  

A.15:  I agree with that.  I, I think you do see more and more women out there in
politics, too, as mayors --

B.16:  Yes.  

A.17:  -- or, uh, you know, in, in helping to maybe, uh, get some legislation
passed to, to have women have more rights.  I think still, even with that
whole, um, thing with Judge Thomas and, and, uh, you, you still felt like the
woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man or
something the way they had the trial and --

B.18:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.19:  -- uh, I just think that it's, it's still going to take another generation
or so before, before the women really, could really feel that they're really
equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder
[laughter].

B.20:  Right, right.  

A.21:  Uh, but it's still, uh, going from, from homemakers into, uh, corporate
leaders is still a big step.

B.22:  Right, I also think that, uh, uh, women as homemakers are beginning to get
more respect than they used to be.  Used to be people would say, do you work,
and you'd say, no, I work in the home and --

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  -- it was, it was, then it was almost like a put down, particularly,
particularly even by women in the work force.  But, I think now, I think
people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very, very
important.

A.25:  Yes.  

B.26:  And it's getting the respect and, which is about time.  

A.27:  I think it's true.  I think also people are having children at a older 
age --

B.28:  Yes, very definitely.  

A.29:  -- so it's maybe like, uh, you know, you go through college and then you
maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child and, uh, you
know, you, you know both sides of the coin.

B.30:  That's right.  

A.31:  You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house
running smoothly, and to take care of the kids.  And, and then, uh, maybe
people that are just working and think, oh, you just stay at home.  But then
when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid, it's like,
they lose it [laughter].

B.32:  [Laughter] Right.  

A.33:  They say, wow!  This is harder than I thought [laughter].  

B.34:  Yes [laughter].  

A.35:  Well, you know.  

B.36:  And, and, to those that have never worked and had, you know, and have
stayed home with the kids, kind of does your heart good [laughter].

A.37:  I know it, I know.  

B.38:  Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine
were in high school.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  And, uh, so, you know, it, it kind of does me good.  I think also one of
the things that, that's really tremendous and, it doesn't necessarily have to
do with women, but the fact that the fathers are --

A.41:  Are so involved.  

B.42:  -- so involved with families.  

A.43:  Yes.

B.44:  Which, again, I think it helps a woman's role.  

A.45:  Right, right.  

B.46:  You know,  

A.47:  Their role has to change -- 

B.48:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- to kind of accommodate us, too.  I know, I have three children and my
oldest is eleven and I've pretty much been home, uh, since Brian was born and,
uh, just recently I went back to work, uh, last school semester to tutor, uh,
high school age students with learning disabilities and I was just out of the
house two days a week --

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  -- but, I thought, wow, this is really hard, only, and it was only two days
and I was home before three.

B.52:  [Laughter].  

A.53:  But getting the baby to day care, getting the kids off to school, I still
did everything I always do, you know, my husband still got up and went to 
work --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- but, uh, it, it, only those two, it made a big difference.  I thought,
wow, full time, I don't think I could swing that personally.

B.56:  Well, I had to, course, I work full time, but my [static] daughter and her
husband were out of town so I had my grandchildren for --

A.57:  Oh. 

B.58:  -- four days during, uh, football, soccer season -- 

A.59:  Oh, boy. 

B.60:  -- and so I would work and her, some friends would take care of the kids,
but I would have to get them picked [static] up from there --

A.61:  Pick up.  

B.62:  -- get them fed, get them to practices -- 

A.63:  Dinner.  

B.64:  -- get homework done, get baths.  

A.65:  Right.

B.66:  I was absolutely exhausted.  

A.67:  I bet, I bet.  

B.68:  And, and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties,
or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.

A.69:  Well, I, I know a lot of people, I know I had my first child when I was
twenty-five, and that's not considered really young these days, that's almost,
you know --

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- but, uh, I have friends that, that have kids just starting kindergarten
and they're, they're forty years old.  And, and then like maybe a two year old
at home, and I think, boy, I, I'm, I'm in my thirt-,
