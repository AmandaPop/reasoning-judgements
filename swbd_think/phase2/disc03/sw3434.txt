=========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, let's see.  Um, when I was working I would wear, um, comfortable
casual type clothes nothing real dressy.

A.2:  Uh-huh.  

B.3:  But, um, [lipsmack] mostly, um, I do like ((to a)) shirts that are kind of
longer and, um, not real high, high shoes.  I would say more --

A.4:  More flats,  

B.5:  -- more, #more flat,# 

A.6:  #and low heels.#  

B.7:  kind of shoes and something that would be comfortable to wear throughout
the day.  Nothing that would be too dressy [noise].

A.8:  Well, I work in an office so I wear a lot of suits and, but my shoes are
lower heels.

B.9:  [Static] {very faint}  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  I'm not able to wear high heels, and, uh, I wear, but right now it's ki-,
it's real casual in this office because we're getting ready for this holiday
and, and we're wearing pants and sweaters.

B.11:  Which is nice.  #That's, that's,#  

A.12:  #A lot of girls wear# jeans but I just, I don't approve of that in a
office.

B.13:  Uh-huh.  I felt the same way.  Well, I work in a private high school and I
always felt like I had to dress, I dress #casually,#

A.14:  #Oh, yes.# 

B.15:  but yet I dress a little bit, I dress totally dressy compared to what the
kids came in to.

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  What the kids looked like, you know. 

A.18:  #Well you're an,#

B.19:  #I had to,#

A.20:  example for #the kids then.# 

B.21:  #Right.# So I had this, and real conservative, my taste runs real
conservative.  I like white blouses with little ((Peter Pan)) collars and
sweaters and cardigans and turtlenecks and just kind of, um, just very
conservative kind of traditional clothes and nothing, nothing at all faddish.

A.22:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.23:  #I don't,# I get suits with dresses that I have that I had several years
that I can pull out of my closet and they will still be in style just as they
were when I first bought them.

A.24:  Oh, that's #good, that's good.#  

B.25:  #You know, that kind of stuff.# 

A.26:  Uh-huh.  That's the kind to get.  

B.27:  Yeah.  

A.28:  The kind that's in style for a long time.  

B.29:  Yeah, and just, 

A.30:  That's the kind I have too.  

B.31:  Just, um,

A.32:  I like a lot of color though too.  

B.33:  I do too.  I do too.  #A lot of,# 

A.34:  #I like# the peaches and, uh,

B.35:  Uh-huh.  Well I have, uh, dark hair so I do like to wear the real bright.
I like br-, bright royal blues and bright reds on, on me.

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  And that's kind of nice.  Especially for the holidays it's fun to dress
((with all)) the bright colors.

A.38:  Right.  Well, I have light hair.  It's a kind of a reddish blonde,

B.39:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.40:  #so I# wear the bright blues too and the,  

B.41:  Uh-huh.  

A.42:  Uh, but I can't wear red.  

B.43:  #No.# 

A.44:  #Red is# just too much.  

B.45:  Too much for you.  Uh-huh.  Huh.  Okay [child].

A.46:  But I like the peaches and the greens and the blues and,

B.47:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.48:  #and, uh,# 

B.49:  #And, uh,# let's see.  What was the question?  Did we #supposed to k-,#

A.50:  #The seasons,# the colors in the seasons.  #There's,# 

B.51:  #Okay.# 

A.52:  I like the darker colors in the fall.  

B.53:  Yes.  

A.54:  The browns and the,

B.55:  Now, browns, I stay away [/noise] from browns because I have dark eyes and
dark hair so #for me I,#

A.56:  #Oh, okay.  See I wear a lot# of those.  

B.57:  #A lot of those (( )),#

A.58:  #I like a lot of brown.#

B.59:  pretty shirt.

A.60:  Uh-huh.  

B.61:  Uh-huh.  That, that, I have a, a little three year old that has very blonde
hair and I dress her with different colors that I never get to wear like the
bright, the bright, um, she looks really pretty in yellow just like a real
bright lemon yellow,

A.62:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.63:  #and, um,# certain colors like that.  And, um, I'll put on her and they
look real cute [noise].

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  Um, that's it.  #Well,#

A.66:  #Yeah, well,# I like a lot of, I wear a lot of nice clothes too, of course,
they are expensive.  It takes money to dress nice now.

B.67:  Well that's the, that's the problem I think it's #you know, the way,#

A.68:  #Well, when you work,# 

B.69:  you would like to dress and the way [laughter] you could, 

A.70:  #Yeah.# 

B.71:  #afford# to dress is too different.  

A.72:  When you work, a lot of your money goes to your clothes,

B.73:  #Yes.#  

A.74:  #because you're trying# to look nice like everybody else,  

B.75:  #That's right.# 

A.76:  #in the office.#

B.77:  I, see, I'm not even just working part-time in this, uh, private school
last year, um, it was, it was an expense just to get started to get the
clothes,

A.78:  #That's right.# 

B.79:  #after being home# with the kids, 

A.80:  #That's right.# 

B.81:  #and# like I said, it was real important because I was working around
teenagers and I, like you said, had to set an example, and I, well, wouldn't
have felt comfortable wearing jeans although some of the teachers did once in
a while that, I don't, I very rarely even just wear jeans at home.

A.82:  Yeah.  

B.83:  You know, I'm not comfortable, 

A.84:  #Well now you could have,# 

B.85:  #in them.#  [Child].

A.86:  mixed and matched them.  Did you do that?  Different shirts and blouses and
--

B.87:  Yes.  

A.88:  -- to make different outfits?  

B.89:  Yes.  

A.90:  #Uh-huh.#

B.91:  #That,# that is a big consideration.  If I have a, a solid navy blue blazer
I might, you know, go ahead and pick up a plaid shirt or,

A.92:  #Yeah.# 

B.93:  #something# and then,

A.94:  #You can make,#

B.95:  #maybe a# solid or whatever to mix and match that.

A.96:  Uh-huh.

B.97:  I sit there and really kind of, I really have to take a long time to think
about what to, to get because, like I said, you have to,

A.98:  Can make your wardrobe larger, 

B.99:  #Right.#  

A.100:  #that way# by,  

B.101:  To make it, right.  And also adding some accessaries to different,
different things.  I'm not a real, um, I don't like to wear really big
earrings.  I kind of have a few gold earrings that are my favorites and just
little pearls.  (( )) kind of boring and #conservative [laughter].#

A.102:  #Well, now the,# the scarves, I didn't really go for the scarves, did you?

B.103:  No, they, once in a while I'd, I'd try one on and it would seem right and
then before I walked out the door I'd have it off because it just didn't feel
right [child].

A.104:  Yeah.  I just didn't go for the scarves, I don't know.  

B.105:  I didn't, um, I didn't like that too much either.

A.106:  I knew some women that, they, in fact, they still,
