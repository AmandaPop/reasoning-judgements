B.1:   Okay, you ready?  

A.2:   Yeah, is that it?  

B.3:   That's it.  

A.4:   Okay, [laughter].  Uh, well, we, I guess we have to talk about
magazines and, uh, what, what,   

B.5:   What, what kind do you subscribe to or do you?  

@A.6:   Well, I subscribe to P-, well, I did subscribe to PEOPLE for
a long time.  I do, you know, I enjoy PEOPLE.  And now I'm, uh,
[noise] I, uh, subscribe to, uh, LADIES HOME JOURNAL.  

B.7:   I, uh, take a computer magazine.  

A.8:   Uh-huh.  

B.9:   And, uh, also, uh, BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS.  

A.10:   Okay, are you interested in, in computers?  

B.11:   And my pet peeve with magazines -- 

A.12:   Yeah.  

B.13:   -- is all the little cards inside.  

A.14:   [Laughter]. 

B.15:   And the cardboard pages [laughter].  

A.16:   Uh-huh, yeah, well, that, that would be one of my peeves.  My
pet peeves with magazines, the woman's magazines especially, I
mean, it's, it's really geared to, all they have, you have too many
recipes first of all.  I just don't, you know, that's what I don't
like about [noise] LADIES HOME JOURNAL magazines.  Too many
recipes, too many, uh, can this marriage with saved nonsense.  I,
you know, I like to read articles about things that matter.  Well,
of course, PEOPLE magazine is not, you know, one of your, uh,  

B.17:   [Laughter].  

A.18:   your more intellectual magazines, but it's nice, light
reading [laughter].  You know, if I want something intellectual, I
usually read a book.  

B.19:   Well, that's true.  I, uh, I like it [noise] when they have
short stories.  Like REDBOOK used to always have a good short story
in it.  

A.20:   Well, that's true, yeah, they did.  

B.21:   And I haven't bought a REDBOOK in a while [noise], so I guess 
[laughter],  

A.22:   Yeah.  

B.23:   I, I really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore [noise].  

A.24:   Well, is REDBOOK still in existence?  I don't know [laughter]
if they're, if they're around anymore.  

B.25:   Yeah [breathing].  I think it is.  Surely, it's an
institution, surely it would have to be.  

A.26:   Yeah.  

B.27:   But,  

A.28:   Well, I'll tell you, the only reason I bought the, uh, I
subscribe to the JOURNAL is because of, which I think it was
either, yeah, it was Publisher's Clearinghouse [laughter],   

B.29:   Right [laughter].  

A.30:   They told me, you know, if I didn't subscribe they were going
to take me off their, their winning, you know, their list
[laughter].  So,   

B.31:   Mine, too [laughter].  This was it, my last chance [laughter]. 

A.32:   Yeah, my last, right, my last chance to win ten million
dollars, so I figured, hey, look [laughter].  

B.33:   Well, I, I,  

A.34:   For twelve dollars, you know,  

B.35:   I went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that -- 

A.36:   That's it.  

B.37:   -- uh, to, uh, ENTERTAINMENT.  

A.38:   Oh, yeah, oh, uh-huh.  

B.39:   And I was real disappointed with it.  

A.40:   Yeah.  

B.41:   I, I don't know, it just, not enough stories with some
substance that you can really get into.  

A.42:   [Noise] Right.  

B.43:   It's little short articles more than anything else.  

A.44:   Uh-huh.  

B.45:   And that's one thing I don't like about PEOPLE.  Uh, it's
just, you know, doesn't seem to have enough story to it.  

A.46:   Well, I don't know, I just think, uh, you know, it's,

B.47:   #If you've only got a short time to read [laughter].#

A.48:   #It's light reading.  You know, you don't have,# well, you
don't have to concentrate, you know [laughter] you know.  

B.49:   No, that's true [laughter].  

A.50:   It's entertaining, you know, and, uh, that's, I just, I enjoy
it, I, you know, I, uh [noise].  Well, that ENTERTAINMENT is, is
very, wasn't that similar, or isn't it similar to, to the TV GUIDE? 

B.51:   Uh, [breathing], no, not really.  I mean, not the one I
take now.  It's a, it's a magazine and it goes into all the movies,
previewing the movies -- 

A.52:   Oh, uh-huh.  

B.53:   -- that are going to be released or behind the scenes.  

A.54:   Oh, I see.  

B.55:   And, uh, I'm a real movie buff, so that's why I thought I
might be interested in it, but it just hasn't been what I thought
it would be.  

A.56:   Oh, uh-huh.  

B.57:   And, uh, my mother has subscribed to, is the reason I get, uh,
the [noise] HOME JOURNAL and the, uh, computer book is because
mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me.  

A.58:   Oh. 

B.59:   Otherwise, if, if I really want to take the time to read a
magazine and I see one on the grocery shelf, I'll pick it up then. 

A.60:   Right, right.  

B.61:   Rather than having them delivered and think, oh, I really need
to read this [laughter].  

A.62:   Well, I'll tell you, since I've been getting the JOURNAL, like
maybe, maybe I'll read two, maybe three, if I read three articles
in, in, you know, one of the JOURNALs, I figure, you know, I did
really well.  

B.63:   Yeah,

A.64:   Because there's just nothing in there that interests me.  I
don't, you know, I don't, I'm not into, you know, recipes and 
[laughter],  

B.65:   Well, I, I do like recipes and crafts.  

A.66:   See, now, and I'm not into crafts, so, you know, that, that
eliminates, like three quarters of the magazine [laughter].  

B.67:   [Laughter]. 

A.68:   You know.  

B.69:   That's true.  

A.70:   Well, I just got the new issue, they have Bette Midler on the
cover, so that should be one article that I'll read anyway [laughter].  

B.71:   Do you, uh,
