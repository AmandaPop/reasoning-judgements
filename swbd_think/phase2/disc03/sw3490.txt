=============================================================================

A.1:  Oh, now we can talk about that great team.  

B.2:  Yeah, I think we know where we're heading.  Well, [breathing] well, I just
heard I guess, uh, big problem right now (( )) starting to sign Sierra, you
know, but, apparently he was signed for twenty-five at five is what they're
saying.

A.3:  You, you think he's worth it? 

B.4:  Well,

A.5:  [Laughter] #Who could be worth that, huh?#  

B.6:  #I mean, I don't know, I think,# I think I'm worth twenty-five million if
he is but,

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  uh, as far as, I mean, if they're going to pay Nolan Ryan four and a half
million, I mean, yeah, he's definitely worth it just because, I mean, Ryan's
only couple good years left in him where Sierra's got at least another ten or
fifteen years but I mean, 

A.9:  I, I think they'd be better off trading him off for two million and a half
dollar a year pitchers.  They can win some --

B.10:  Well, uh,

A.11:  -- twelve games each.  

B.12:  The problem is you have Tom House who is going to, he'll blow their arms
out, I mean,

A.13:  That's true, that's true.  

B.14:  And Sierr-, I mean pitchers, you got a, uh, they've got to resign them just
to keep the credibility of the franchise, I mean, because if they don't resign
them, I mean, that's pretty much going to be the last straw.  They kept Val-,
Valentine way too long.

A.15:  I think you're right.  I, I think that as long as they, they keep that, uh,
management team, I don't think there is going to be a winner.  I agree with
you.

B.16:  And, it's, you know, I don't think, I mean, he's even said he, he, you
know, that, probably will not, not sign for as much as Bonilla did, but, I
mean, because apparently he's, he, uh, he's real into Arabian horses and, one
of the minority owners is a big time, uh, Arabian horse, uh, dealer, or,
whatever and he's, I guess there has been some, he'd want, he wants to stay
out here and get some land and develop that because (( )), show yet or not.
Apparently he, he doesn't want to, he doesn't really have the stomach to go
into a large market and have to prove himself all over again.

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  He's got it made if he just stays there so he'll probably stay and,

A.19:  Oh, I'd stay for five million bucks a year.  

B.20:  Oh, I'll stay for a million but,

A.21:  [Laughter] They could twist my arm.  

B.22:  You know, if it's somebody that's going to pay, I mean, you might as well,
I, you know, can't blame him for taking it, I mean, 

A.23:  Well, I, I, I don't either.  I, I think, uh, you know, the whole, whole
sports have gotten out of control and watch, watch a game on T V, they got so
many ads to pay for the thing.  If I can fall asleep during a football game
wake up and not have missed a, missed a down for crying out,

B.24:  Oh, exactly.  

A.25:  And that's the way baseball's going turn into.  It is, they, they have gone
up to, uh, last year ninety seconds between innings instead of a minute and --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- they keep escalating the salaries as they are, I think they're going to
wind up with as much, you know, advertising as they do, uh, playing ball and,
uh, it's going to eventually kill the golden goose.  I, I think, I,

B.28:  I don't even think it's America's pastime anymore.  I think football
[breathing] took it over.  I mean, I was a big baseball fan when I was
younger, but, I still follow it and everything, but it's just,

A.29:  Oh, I, I enjoy -- 

B.30:  Just,

A.31:  -- I enjoy them both.  I, I, uh, #refereed football for fourt-, yeah, for
f-,# 

B.32:  #Yeah, it is the only thing going in the summer.# But football is
definitely a little bit more exciting right now, but, I mean, you know,

A.33:  I think, uh, amateur, you know, high school and college is a lot more
enjoyable to watch than, uh, you know, football, than, than the pros.

B.34:  Oh, yeah, I agree.  

A.35:  They're just sitting around, I, last Cowboy game I went to they were
sitting around, uh, between plays so long, uh, I don't see how they can break
a sweat for heaven sakes, you know.

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  Just waiting on ins.  

B.38:  That's one thing that's,

A.39:  And, uh, it, it's too bad.  

B.40:  Yeah, the worst is when they, they kick the ball off after, uh, when it's a
commercial --

A.41:  Yep.  

B.42:  -- after they score a touchdown.  

A.43:  Yeah, then they got, then they got another -- 

B.44:  Then they kick it off.  

A.45:  -- six more commercials [laughter]. 

B.46:  Then the commercial after that, they bring them, you know, that's, that's
the one commercial I think they need to eliminate.

A.47:  Yep, but they won't.  They, they want the money, you know.  And, uh,

B.48:  Someone's got to pay for it.  

A.49:  Yeah, they're, they're greedy and they, you know, they all admit it's a
business and that's what comes first and that's probably what the, is, is a
major problem with the Rangers.  They make money and they don't, uh, as long
as they make money and are respectable, they don't make a, you know, they
aren't going to pay the bucks out to be a winner and lose money.  And that's
apparently what it takes [ringing].  What it, what, what it's taking right 
now,

B.50:  Well, I think they're just hoping something happens to them like happened
to Atlanta which is a fluke [ringing], I thought anyway.

A.51:  Tell you what, I got, I got to keep talking to you, but I think this is my
car guy calling on this line, so, we're, we're, we're probably almost done,
but hang on just, hello {speaking on another phone},

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  Yes.  

B.54:  Okay, uh {still speaking on the other phone}. 

A.55:  Good.  

B.56:  Got another call?  

A.57:  Uh, well, that's, that's okay, hang on a minute Andy {still on the other
phone}.

B.58:  #Okay.#  

A.59:  #Okay?# [Laughter] We'll finish this off.  I've been waiting five days
for my car, so he can wait a couple seconds here.

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  

A.61:  [Laughter] That's, uh, but, anyway, I, I think we've probably got a
situation that we aren't going to see a winner this year, but, as long as,

B.62:  Well, I, I just, I mean, [laughter] I've been a fan since, I guess the
middle seventies and, uh, it's just been the same thing every year.  I don't
expect anything and, I mean the lineup they,
