==========================================================================

A.1:  this area, Dallas?  

B.2:  I'm born and raised here.  

A.3:  Well, great, so who you want to talk about baseball?  

@B.4:  May as well talk about the Rangers.  

A.5:  The Rangers, all right.  

B.6:  Might as well.  

A.7:  Well, do you think they're going to get anyone in Florida [noise]?

B.8:  Uh, I hope, I hope they do.  They've, uh, I forgot who have they signed
already.

A.9:  Did they sign that shortstop that was, they were talking about some
shortstop they were going to try to get in the free agency draft or the free
agency market.  For {faint},

B.10:  I don't know who they, uh, they, they decide, sign-, finally signed, uh,
Brian Downing, I know.

A.11:  Oh, okay.  

B.12:  They're, they're trying to get, uh, God, what's his name, what's that black
man's name.  Uh, [breathing],

A.13:  Is he with them now?  

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  Ruben.

B.16:  Ruben, yeah.  

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  Yeah, they still haven't signed Ruben yet.  

A.19:  No, I heard that they're not going to talk to him till next week's now.
They talked to his agents today and then they're going to talk to them some
more next week, which, I don't know whether that's good, bad or indifferent,
because, wish they'd get that out of the way and maybe he could do something
else.

B.20:  Yeah, I know.  Well, they said they made a mistake.  They made a mistake by
d-, uh, not sign-, not signing him, uh, to a longer contract than what they
did.

A.21:  I know.  Why do you think they did that?  

B.22:  Oh, they d-, did, did it for economics, but it's coming back and it's going
to haunt them this year because he played such good ball the last couple of
years --

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  -- because now his, uh, his contracts, they, they, I think they signed him
for like three or four hundred thousand --

A.25:  Oh. 

B.26:  -- last year, but now it's going to cost them somewhere about, uh, eight
hundred thousand to a million [laughter], which is kind of, 

A.27:  You don't think he'll get that twenty-seven million like that other guy
just got?

B.28:  I don't think so.  I don't, he'll, he, it's, it's going to cost them,
though.

A.29:  [Laughter]. 

B.30:  It's going to cost them, but he's worth it.  

A.31:  That's true.  Well, do you think they need to fire Bobby?  

B.32:  Valentine is a good guy.  I don't know if he's, I don't know, he's, he's
done a lot for the team.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  He really has.  I think he's an excellent, I think he's an excellent coach.
He's probably one of the best ones that they've had just because he's more
consistent.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  He's more consistent than any other coach that we've had and, had there in
a long time, but I, I think he'll do some good.  He just needs a, they just
need to put together a good pitching staff and I think they'll go pretty good.

A.37:  Not have so many injuries.  

B.38:  Yeah, that was, that's what killed them last year.  

A.39:  I know {faint}.

B.40:  I went to, went to a few of their games and it just, uh, the pitching was
okay, but it was, it was inconsistent.

A.41:  Are you comfortable that Bobby Witt will be back, or is he ever going to
develop into a super pitcher?

B.42:  Uh, I don't think he is.  

A.43:  [Laughter]. 

B.44:  I don't think he is.  

A.45:  [Laughter]  What about Kevin Brown?  

B.46:  Kevin Brown?  Uh, he might, he might, he still, he's still got a little
learning to do.

A.47:  Yeah, I thought maybe he would, but I was kind of disappointed last year.

B.48:  Yeah, I was disappointed the whole season, so [laughter].

A.49:  Well, they, 

B.50:  They, they, they started out, I mean, if they would have continued, they
went off that fourteen game losing streak, or winning streak, then they kind
of hit the dumps there for a while.

A.51:  Yeah, but then all the pitchers were hurt, so that, that really hurts when
you can't, when all of the pitchers get hurt like that.

B.52:  Yeah, that's true.  You think they're going to do anything this year?

A.53:  I don't know.  I, uh, uh, I think they need a, another arm and I'm still
not sure that that new third baseman, Dean Palmer is as good as they think
he's going to be.  That,

B.54:  I think they made a mis-, they made a mistake trading Buechele.

A.55:  Well, I don't think they, uh, I think they knew they couldn't afford him
and Ruben and they decided to go with Ruben because he's, 

B.56:  Yeah, that's probably true, but, you know, you got to, you got to have
more, not one person is going to make the team.

A.57:  Yeah, but they're not willing to pay big bucks it doesn't seem.

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  I think they'll have an exciting team last, next year.  I just, you know,
if they don't have any injuries, but, uh, Kansas City, you know, just signed a
big time player, so they're, they're tough at signing all those people.  They
got, uh, Joiner, Wally Joiner from California.

B.60:  Oh, yeah?  

A.61:  That should help their team.  

B.62:  Yeah, it sounds like you keep up on baseball pretty well.  

A.63:  No, I have one of those, uh, minds that remembers trivia that's of
completely useless.

B.64:  That [laughter] what?  Useless trivia [laughter].  

A.65:  Yeah, I mean something important I can't remember, but something about
baseball or football or something that really doesn't mean anything I can
remember.  It's one of those weird things [laughter] I don't know why.  And I
can't find my car keys then, but I can remember, you know, something that,
about sports that's not even important.

B.66:  Remember, remember who Kansas City signed, but you can't find your car
keys.

A.67:  That's [laughter] right.  

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  Or my glasses [laughter].  

B.70:  [Laughter]  That's great.  

A.71:  Yeah, I know, and, and why, why do I remember sports?  It's just one of
those things, I don't know why that if, I can hear it on the radio and it just
sinks in.

B.72:  Well, that's great. 

A.73:  Well, 

B.74:  I've never, I've never had a decent conversation with a woman about
baseball.

A.75:  Well, that's, that's,  

B.76:  Un-, until now.  

A.77:  Yeah, oh, [laughter].  

B.78:  [Laughter]. 

A.79:  That's ((embarrassing)) almost, but, no, I could probably name them, almost
the starting lineup for the,
