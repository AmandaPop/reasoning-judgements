=========================================================================

A.1:  Think they want us to talk about -- 

B.2:  Football.  

A.3:  -- football, our favorite football teams,  

B.4:  [Laughter]. 

A.5:  and it doesn't sound like to you yours will be the Dallas Cowboys with
your accent.

B.6:  Well, it is, well, actually it isn't.  Actually, the New York Giants
[laughter],

A.7:  Oh, right.  

B.8:  But, I do like the Cowboys.  

A.9:  Oh, okay, where are you?  

B.10:  Well, I'm in, in, uh, Plano in Texas.  

A.11:  Plano?  

B.12:  Yeah, where are you?  

A.13:  I'm in Dallas.  

B.14:  Oh, well [laughter].  

A.15:  Well, what are you doing down here?  

B.16:  Uh,

A.17:  You working?  

B.18:  Well, my husband was transferred down here.

A.19:  Oh, was he T, with T I?  

B.20:  No, uh-huh.  

A.21:  Okay.  

B.22:  But, anyway, they want us to talk about football.  

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  And, uh,

@A.25:  Your favorite team is the New York Giants.  

B.26:  Yes, but you know they're not doing so good this year [laughter].

A.27:  Well, that's true.  But that happens after the [noise] -- 

B.28:  Yes.  

A.29:  -- anytime you're the Super Bowl team, it's, it's hard to repeat because
everybody is shooting for you.

B.30:  Yeah, that's true, but, I don't know, they have basically the same team
they had last year, I just, I think the coaching stinks.

A.31:  You don't think that maybe their desire is not there or maybe they are a
year older?

B.32:  Well, I don't know.  I just think, uh they got rid of Bill Parcells, well,
they didn't get rid of him, he quit.

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  And I just don't like the guy that has replaced him.  He is very
conservative in his play calling, you know.  I think he, uh, he sh-, he could
have taken more chances this year.

A.35:  You don't think Parcells saw the handwriting and thought he'd be better to
go out as a winner?

B.36:  Well, that's possible, but now I hear, uh, he's been talking with the, uh,
Tampa Bay.

A.37:  I know it, but see, he can only go up from there because they're so --

B.38:  Exactly [laughter].  

A.39:  -- bad [laughter].  

B.40:  Exactly [laughter].  

A.41:  You know, if you go out on top and you go somewhere else that's bad, well
it's,

B.42:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.43:  Well, I, I don't know, I think Phil Simms, uh, do you Phil Simms might have
been treated badly since he got bumped aside for --

B.44:  Well -- 

A.45:  -- Hostetler?  

B.46:  -- [Lipsmack] gee, I don't know, it's hard to say, you know, [laughter]
Hostetler brought them to the Super Bowl and, uh --

A.47:  Yeah, but -- 

B.48:  -- I don't know.  

A.49:  -- do you, do you think it's better because Simms was hurt that he didn't
get his job back and then if he didn't do the job, put Hostetler in there?

B.50:  Well, it's a, that's possible, you know, who's to say, I mean, uh,

A.51:  That's right.

B.52:  I don't know.  Hostetler, he had his, his r-, numbers were there, I mean,
you know, he, he had pretty good numbers, but, uh,

A.53:  It just seemed to me that everybody was just a half a step off.  I don't
know whether it was age or determination or coaching or what, you know,
because it just, somehow, they were almost there --

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  -- all the time.  

B.56:  I don't know, it was very disappointing.  Their offense was very, it
didn't do anything.  I mean their, their maybe they, they I think the most
they scored in any game was like twenty-four points or something.

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  You know, they really had a, I don't know why because they had the same,
well, you know, they had the same offense as last year, but they didn't score
all that many points last year in each game, but they, uh, #they have a
terrific,#

A.59:  #One of those things# where everything just falls in place for you,
you know.

B.60:  Yeah I, I guess.  Yeah, well, how about the Cowboys.  They're doing, you
know, great.

A.61:  That's right, but look what happened to them the last [laughter] of years.

B.62:  Well, yeah, but, now, you know, they're really on the road back, you know.

A.63:  Yeah, that's true.  

B.64:  I mean that, that game yesterday was terrific.  

A.65:  Were you out there?  

B.66:  No, no, I, I haven't been to a game in a long time.  

A.67:  Oh, well, I've had season tickets since n-, nineteen sixty-seven.  So --

B.68:  Oh, really?  

A.69:  -- I've seen a few games [laughter].  

B.70:  Oh, that's great.  Were you out there yesterday?  

A.71:  Yes, uh-huh.  

B.72:  Oh, man [laughter].  

A.73:  So, it's, uh, well, do you think Lawrence Taylor is about had it?

B.74:  I don't think so.  I mean, I hope not, anyway.  

A.75:  Yeah, I know, he's -- 

B.76:  #I mean he's so# -- 

A.77:  -- #fun to watch.#  

B.78:  -- good, you know.  

A.79:  Yeah, he's great to watch.  

B.80:  Yeah, he's, he's real good.  

A.81:  Yeah, well, you think you all will fire your coach?  

B.82:  Uh, I don't know.  You know, I don't know.  I think maybe they'll give him
another year.

A.83:  Yeah, they probably well.  

B.84:  You know, but, uh, I was disappointed he was too conservative and he just
didn't take enough chances --

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- #and, uh,#   

A.87:  #When,#  

B.88:  I, you know, I, I prefer them to get somebody else.  I'd like to see them
get Parcells back [laughter].

A.89:  Well, I think he probably had had pressure long enough and he wants to go
somewhere where he can, you know, I can see his point.  It was a good time for
him to leave, really.

B.90:  Yeah, he left on top.  

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  You know, two, s-, Super Bowls in, uh, what four years.  That's --

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  -- pretty damn good.  

A.95:  What else could you do?  

B.96:  Yeah, you know.  He couldn't really top it, so, uh, and now I'm sure he's
making more money doing, uh, you know, sports reporting.

A.97:  Well, what do you think y'all's draft ch-, needs are for next year, or do
you get into it that deep?

B.98:  What, the Giants?  

A.99:  Uh-huh.  

B.100:  [Lipsmack] Uh, you know, I really don't, I guess, I guess I can, uh, I
really don't know.  Defense and offense I suppose, you know.  I've got the,
they've got the running backs so they could use a, uh, I guess they could use
some more good receivers.

A.101:  Well, didn't you all lose your tight end also?  That, that,

B.102:  Yes, and Navarro was -- 

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  -- terrific.  Yeah, they could use a, a couple of really good tight ends.
They really --

A.105:  What ha-, 

B.106:  -- they don't really have, you know, really, you know -- 

A.107:  What happened to him?  

B.108:  -- super tight ends.  

A.109:  Did they trade him, or did he go,

B.110:  Navarro, he was, uh, injured and, I don't know, then he came back and then
they released him.

A.111:  Is that, I couldn't remember what happened to him.  

B.112:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.113:  Because he was good.  

B.114:  Oh, he was terrific.  He was like, uh, Novacheck is,
