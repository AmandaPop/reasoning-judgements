============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well have you bought anything recently, and, uh, if so, do you find
it to your liking?  Do you think it's worth the money?

B.2:  I bought, I haven't returned it, but I bought a, I went down to San Marcos
to the Coach Store, and bought a Coach handbag --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and I've had it now for two months, and I have owned Coach products
before, [beep] that's why I love them so much, and, uh, I am going to have to
take this back to have it repaired --

A.5:  Oh, really.

B.6:  -- after two months.  I am so peeved.

A.7:  Yeah, I can imagine --

B.8:  I think it's.

A.9:  -- because they're not cheap.

B.10:  No they're not, not even at twenty-five percent off.  So, um, I just, uh,
and I've owned many before.  I'm just really not a bit happy with it.  I don't
know if they've gotten too big or too popular or, or what.  But you expect,
when you.

A.11:  Well, I know that in going out and, and looking at clothes, uh, even --

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  -- going to expensive stores, the clothes look to me so sleazy [beep] any
more.  I don't know whether it's the type of materials they're using --

B.14:  Yes [laughter].

A.15:  -- is it, you know, is it supposed to be, you know crepe, or what, and, or
if it's a case, now I was in Dillard's --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- in an area, and they hadn't even, they'd hung the clothes out but they
hadn't even pressed them --

B.18:  I saw that.

A.19:  -- so they didn't look good --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- to begin with, and, uh, you know, and they looked cheap, and they were,
you know, they weren't cheap, they were hundred and thirty-nine, hundred and
fifty.  You know, you don't buy, find cheap dresses any more, even at Penney's
[laughter].

B.22:  No.

A.23:  Especially at Penney's.  They've upgraded considerably [laughter].

B.24:  Exactly.

A.25:  And, uh, the only thing that I know that we have, uh, uh, televisions --

B.26:  Uh-huh [gasp].

A.27:  -- we have, have gotten real good televisions.  We have had real good luck
with televisions, and I just, well, I think that their, I think their quality
is better.

B.28:  But to see, you can buy, you could, you could, you pay the same price for a
new television as you do for a new suit, #a man's suit.#

A.29:  #Well that's true,# that's true --

B.30:  [Laughter] You know.

A.31:  -- you know, you do [laughter].  You can buy a portable cheaper than you
can buy a man's suit [laughter].

B.32:  Oh, exactly, I was, uh, I, I bought something the other day, and I thought,
well, I've been wanting this new whatever, and I, this, this is my new br-, I
know what it was, I was, wanting this new television, and this is, this is my
new T V, and it was like three pairs of shoes and, uh, you know,

A.33:  [Laughter].

B.34:  and I've gone to the outlet to buy the shoes.

A.35:  I know.  Well, I know that, uh, our son for Christmas, we usually for
Christmas, we will give him a suit --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- and we try to, you know, stay around two hundred and something on them.

B.38:  Huh.  

A.39:  Well, you can't find a suit --

B.40:  Even.

A.41:  -- any more for two hundred and something.

B.42:  Even at, uh, the Men's Warehouse and things like that.

A.43:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  You know, I could, you know, for what some of the suits
cost, they have just moved into a new house, I could buy them a, a small new
refrigerator almost [laughter] as cheap --

B.44:  Exactly.

A.45:  -- as what the [laughter] suits are, and that's utterly ridiculous.
Clothing has just gotten totally out of sight, and I hate to spend, you know,
a hundred and fifty dollars for a dress that's made in Taiwan.

B.46:  That, the, you have to pay five dollars to have cleaned every two times --

A.47:  Yes.

B.48:  -- you wear it or something.

A.49:  Yes, yes, very definitely.  So, uh, you know, I, I, other than the T V -s.
Uh, T V -s I do think are made pretty good, uh, but I don't think cars are
made that well any more.

B.50:  I am real happy with my car.

A.51:  Now what is it, what car do you.

B.52:  A Ford.

A.53:  A Ford?

B.54:  Yeah, I, I think everything's, it's, oh, four and a half years old and
everything works on it, and --

A.55:  Oh, that's good.

B.56:  -- nothing's fallen off or broken.  I know friends with Chryslers that
haven't had that luck, and Toyotas that haven't had that luck, and.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  But, uh, no, I think, I think you're right.  The electronics seem to be of
decent quality.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  I don't know whether competition is so stiff between Japan and,
and the U S, or I don't know what it is.  But, you know, the electronics seem
to be, you know, pretty good value for their money.

B.60:  And going down in price, too.

A.61:  Yes, yes, definitely, because I know the price of the big screen T V -s --

B.62:  Oh.

A.63:  -- they're going down --

B.64:  And.

A.65:  -- you know, compared to what they were three years ago. 

B.66:  I bought a little camera about six years ago, that I just thought was the,
the bee's knees {phonetically spelled} or whatever,

A.67:  [Laughter].

B.68:  it just, I mean, just wonderful, and now I can get it for fifty dollars
less.  The same model --

A.69:  Same model, uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and for the same price I can get one that does a lot more.

A.71:  The only thing I'm not seeing goi-, go down that much is the camcorders,
the video tape things.

B.72:  Well, not a lot, no.

A.73:  They've gone down a little bit.  We just bought one.  We kept thinking they
would get much cheaper, you know --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- like somewhere around five or six hundred dollars, but they're still
right up there around nine, eight or nine hundred dollars --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- you know, which kind of surprised me because the-, how long have they
been out now, almost ten years?

B.78:  Oh, yeah, my brother has an old one.

A.79:  Uh-huh, and uh, so, uh.

B.80:  They've gotten smaller though, and.

A.81:  That's true, and maybe that's what it is, maybe they're just coming, you
know, they're constantly working on them, and so therefore they keep changing
and they don't have any reason yet to,
