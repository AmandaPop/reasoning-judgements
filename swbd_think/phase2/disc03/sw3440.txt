A.1:  Okay [laughter].

B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  What do you like?  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  What do I like?  [Laughter].

A.5:  Do you watch T V much?  

@B.6:  Well, my kids watch it quite a bit.  I have teenagers and so --

A.7:  Oh.  

B.8:  -- you know, they, they watch, um, T V probably more than I would like for
them to.

A.9:  Really?  

B.10:  We watch, really we watch V C R more than we watch T V,

A.11:  #Oh, yeah.# 

B.12:  #but I'll tell you what# show I don't like rather than what I do like.

A.13:  Okay [laughter].

B.14:  I don't like MARRIED WITH CHILDREN.  

A.15:  No, I don't watch that.   

B.16:  #Do you,# 

A.17:  #In the,# 

B.18:  ever watch it?  

A.19:  I did watch it in the beginning when it was new, and it was kind of funny a
couple of times and then I don't, I don't watch it.

B.20:  Well, my kids like it.  They all think it's funny and, 

A.21:  #Yeah.# 

B.22:  #they all# say good grief you're just too [breathing] you're too old
fashion, it's just a spoof, but I really dislike what it says about marriage.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  I dislike what it says about raising children.   

A.25:  #Yeah.# 

B.26:  #Everybody says# oh, it's, it's just supposed to be funny.

A.27:  #It's just for kick, I know.#  

B.28:  #I don't find it funny.#  I find it insult-, 

A.29:  Yeah, but look at the soap operas.  

B.30:  I don't, I work, 

A.31:  [Laughter] #Yeah.# 

B.32:  #so I'm not a,#  

A.33:  #I do too.  I know.# 

B.34:  #soap opera person# and so I just never watch them.  

A.35:  Yeah.  I'm not a T V person.  I haven't been a T V person and I really
didn't even know what was ever on, and then this year for some reason I have a
twelve year old and for some reason we've just gotten real comfortable with
these little sitcoms at night.

B.36:  Which ones [noise] do you like?  

A.37:  Oh, just the little funny things.  We love FULL HOUSE and,

B.38:  I love FULL HOUSE.  

A.39:  #You know, I just,# 

B.40:  #I think that's# probably one of my favorite, 

A.41:  #Yeah, it's,# 

B.42:  #shows.# 

A.43:  mine too.  And I, it's nice and wholesome and there aren't very many,

B.44:  #No, there aren't.# 

A.45:  #of those, you know.# So, we look forward to that and I love, I just love
that little bitty girl on there [laughter].

B.46:  [Laughter]. 

A.47:  She is so cute.  

B.48:  She's a sweetie.   

A.49:  #Yeah.# 

B.50:  #And it's,# uh, it's really neat because they really have watched her grow
up.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  Did you see it a couple weeks ago when they had her fifth
birthday?

B.52:  Yes.  #They went through all,# 

A.53:  #That was so# precious.  

B.54:  Yeah, it was really well done.  

A.55:  It was and I hadn't realized that she had been on the show, that the show
had been on that long --

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  -- but she was so tiny.  

B.58:  And that she was, I remember when it very first came out.  I remember
watching the very first episode.

A.59:  Oh, #I don't remember.# 

B.60:  #and# God, they were all so young.  Well, you know, the girl that plays 
D J --

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  -- ((Cameron)) that's, uh, Kirk ((Cameron's)) sister.

A.63:  Right.  

B.64:  Do you ever watch GROWING PAINS?  

A.65:  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  

B.66:  Do you watch #that?#

A.67:  #Yeah,# I don't watch it.  I don't like it very much.  

B.68:  Oh, really?  

A.69:  Yeah.  #I just never, I never, got into it,#

B.70:  #Huh.  That's interesting.  Now I like GROWING PAINS.# 

A.71:  and it might be the time that it's on, and I'm not sure when it's on 
but,

B.72:  It used to be on Wednes-, well first it was on Tuesdays -- 

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- and then they switched it to Wednesdays, and I hated that time frame
because I had church choir.  And now it's on Friday nights.

A.75:  I don't know #why,# 

B.76:  #No, it's Saturday nights.#  

A.77:  I don't know why I never watch it, maybe because it's the weekend,

B.78:  Could be, #could be.# 

A.79:  #I'm not# home a lot but, 

B.80:  I think I liked it when it first started better than I like it now.

A.81:  Really?  

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  I never got into it very much.  And my daughter loves QUANTUM LEAP and I
hate that show.

B.84:  No, I've never watched it.  

A.85:  #Oh.#

B.86:  #It's just,# 

A.87:  He's so, 

B.88:  #not me.# 

A.89:  #it's such a# strange thing.  Have you ever seen it?

B.90:  QUANTUM LEAP?  

A.91:  It's, he changes.  He has a little buddy that's sort of like a conscious or
something, I'm not sure.  And he goes to a different time.

B.92:  Huh.  

A.93:  You know, a time in the past.  It's sort of like a back to the future
#thing.#

B.94:  #Oh,# okay.

A.95:  And he goes back and he changes things -- 

B.96:  Oh.  

A.97:  -- so that they're not like somebody doesn't die but he becomes that
person.

B.98:  Oh.  

A.99:  I mean he's already been a pregnant woman and had a baby.  I mean it's,
it's, uh, it's a re-, --

B.100:  Huh.  I think I might have trouble with that [laughter]. 

A.101:  -- it's a re-, uh, I have trouble with it.  It's just a really ridiculous
show.  I just hate it.

B.102:  #But,#

A.103:  #My# daughter looks #forward to it.#

B.104:  #but your daughter likes it.#  

A.105:  She likes it [laughter]. 

B.106:  That's funny [laughter]. 

A.107:  Yeah, I guess so.  I don't know, but I just, I like that kind of thing and
I like BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  That's #a new one to see.#

B.108:  #You like what?#   

A.109:  Uh, BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  

B.110:  I don't watch it either.   

A.111:  It's a new one that just came on this year and I like it because it's the
fifties back in Brooklyn.

B.112:  Oh, see I would probably like that too.  I enjoy things like that.

A.113:  Well, being from New York,

B.114:  #Oh.# 

A.115:  #I relate# to when the Dodgers were in Brooklyn and [laughter],

B.116:  [Laughter]. 

A.117:  I mean back, you know, and so it's like that time and the kids are little
when I was kind of little, you know, and it was it's sort of like that.  So
it's a little bit nostalgic for me and the things that my father taught (( )).
A lot of them are in the show you know [laughter].

B.118:  #I understand.# 

A.119:  #So that# kind of thing.  Yeah, so.  

B.120:  Well [lipsmack], 

A.121:  #I like that.#

@@B.122:  #I think# [lipsmack] I need to be going because I'm trying to get dinner
on the table,

A.123:  #Oh, can we do that?# 

B.124:  #for my daughter and me.# 

A.125:  We don't have to tell them.  

B.126:  #Huh?#

A.127:  #I mean,# they don't tell us when to hang up?

B.128:  They only tell us when, um, when we're down to the last,

A.129:  Oh, I didn't know that.  

B.130:  Time.

A.131:  #Oh, okay, well, you better pull your little paper out.#

B.132:  #When you have to hang up because you've run out of time.# 

A.133:  You better pull your little paper out and keep going then.  

B.134:  [Laughter] I know [laughter].

A.135:  It's not over [laughter]. 

B.136:  Well, maybe someone will call me again [laughter]. 

A.137:  [Laughter]  Maybe they will.  

B.138:  [Laughter]  I hope so.  

A.139:  #Oh, it's been fun to talk to you.#

B.140:  #Listen, I've enjoyed talking to you.#

A.141:  [Breathing]  Me too.  

B.142:  #Have a nice evening.#  

A.143:  #Bye-bye.#  #Thanks.#

B.144:  #Bye.#
