=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, we have an easy subject today, I guess.

B.2:  #[Laughter].#

A.3:  #Easier than# trying to straighten the government out, which was yesterday
#[laughter].#

B.4:  #Oh.# That would be difficult.  Yeah, I had one on immigration.

A.5:  Oh, I didn't get that one [laughter] thank goodness.

B.6:  #[Laughter].#

A.7:  #Oh,# well, you know, I, I went to, back to school a few years ago, and I
tell you, I haven't done much entertaining since #[laughter].#

B.8:  #I know.# I [laughter] I don't have the money to entertain so, 

A.9:  That's another consideration [laughter].

B.10:  Exactly.  I mean, even hamburgers, you know, when you get all the fixings
with it, it's kind of, uh, [lipsmack] expensive.

A.11:  Well, I know, and, uh, time seems to be such a element nowadays.

B.12:  Exactly.  You've got to get things that can be done ahead or,

A.13:  And the house has to be clean.  That's the worse part to me #[laughter].#

B.14:  #Yes.  That,# I have to get my husband to help me with that, because I'd
never, never be able to entertain otherwise.

A.15:  Oh, yeah.  Do you have children?

B.16:  No.

A.17:  Oh, well, that's one less thing to mess up #[laughter].#

B.18:  #That's true,#  Do you have any?

A.19:  Yeah, I have two.  I have, uh, one that's in, uh, college and one that's,
uh, in high school #[laughter].#

B.20:  #Oh.# Well, I've got three black pets, three, two dogs and a cat and 
#so# --

A.21:  #Oh.#

B.22:  -- I've got plenty of pet hair to contend with.

A.23:  Oh, yeah, I've got that too.  I -- 

B.24:  (( )).

A.25:  -- ((really seem to)) #We're a,# 

B.26:  #[Laughter].#

A.27:  family of slobs on top of that. 

B.28:  [Breathing].

A.29:  So the cleaning (( )) really is the worse for entertaining.

B.30:  Well, I guess they wanted us to talk about the, the recipes, I mean --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- what do you, what do you cook?

@A.33:  Well, one of the easy things [breathing] uh, when I did used to entertain
that I like to make is, uh, chicken in wine.  It's real easy and I can make it
ahead of time and then just stick it in the oven to, uh, to heat up, #you
know.#

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  So I don't really like to actually cook when people are already there.

B.36:  Exactly.  I like to be able to entertain and not be killing myself 
#while,#

A.37:  #Right.# And it makes me nervous if they're all in the kitchen messing
around trying to cook,

B.38:  #[Laughter].#

A.39:  #(( ))# stuff, you know what I mean?

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And, um, so that's one thing that I used to make a lot.

B.42:  [Lipsmack] See, usually, we just, li-, like you said, I like to do
something I can do, you know, and just put it in the #fridge# --

A.43:  #Uh-huh.#

B.44:  -- but I, I'll make a chicken and rice and mushrooms dish or --

A.45:  Um.

B.46:  -- you know, uh, easy stuff.  I don't, I, I, I don't do #that much.#

A.47:  #That sounds# good.  We've done shish kabob several times, and people
always like that.

B.48:  #Uh-huh.#

A.49:  #But# it's a lot of work.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  Because the vegetables are so hard, you kind of have to parboil them a
little.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And then, um, season the stuff and marinade it, and then stick it on all
those things [laughter].

B.54:  So you'd think it would be easy, but it's actually [noise], you know,
quite a bit of work.

A.55:  At the last minute it's not so bad, because you can throw it on the grill
and it doesn't take very long --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- but boy, the prepreparation of cutting all that up #in the right 
sizes# --

B.58:  #Exactly.#

A.59:  -- and washing it and, like I said, parboiling some of the hard stuff.

B.60:  Well, that's the problem for me, like cooking Chinese food #because# --

A.61:  #((Yeah)).#

B.62:  -- you know, they always have tons of vegetables.

A.63:  Yeah, you chop forever.

B.64:  Exactly.

A.65:  I've never done that for a party.

B.66:  Well, [sigh] I'll do it when we have a few people over, but not a lot.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  It's too, it's too much for that.

A.69:  #I know.#

B.70:  #But# I mean, I've been known to go over to Sam's and, and, uh, buy a, a
pan of, uh, ready made like enchiladas or, #or something.#

A.71:  #Really?  Are they# good?

B.72:  I don't like the enchiladas very much, but they had some, um,

A.73:  Someone said the lasagna was good.

B.74:  The lasagna is very good, and I've made that as well.

A.75:  I think it must be good, because I have an Italian neighbor down the street
that bought some,

B.76:  #[Laughter].#

A.77:  #for company, I thought golly,# she, but she cooks a lot too.  ((And I
thought)) if she bought it, it must be pretty good [laughter].

B.78:  Yeah.  And, you know, when you, I mean, when you've got company, on, on
days that you work, it's almost impossible.

A.79:  Oh, well, it is.

B.80:  So, you know, that's, that's for me the easiest thing to do.

A.81:  I don't think I ever had something on a day I worked.

B.82:  Oh, I have #[laughter].#

A.83:  #Oh, well, man,# that's horrible.  Where do you work?

B.84:  Um, over, I work at Park Central over, #it's at say L B,# 

A.85:  #{Faint}.  Park Central,# on Central Expressway, is it?

B.86:  Yeah.  Well, at Central and L B J.  And I work for a liquor distiller.

A.87:  Oh.  Do they give you any samples at Christmas?

B.88:  Yes, they do.

A.89:  #[Laughter].#

B.90:  #[Laughter]  We get two# bottles.

A.91:  Well, that's nice.  That's another expensive part about entertaining, if
you plan to drink.  I mean, that is really expensive.

B.92:  Exactly.  No, we have beer and wine, and that's about it.

A.93:  Yeah, that's what most people have nowadays.

B.94:  Yeah, it's just too hard #to get,# 

A.95:  #For big parties,# at least.

B.96:  Yeah, to get all the, you know, the different kinds of, oh, this person
likes gin, #this,# 

A.97:  #I# know.  

B.98:  [Noise].

A.99:  You could spend well over a hundred, a hundred fifty dollars getting all
that stuff.

B.100:  Yeah.

A.101:  So anyway,

B.102:  Well, what do you do for desserts?

A.103:  [Lipsmack] Oh, dessert, um, sometimes I buy it [laughter].

B.104:  Yeah.

A.105:  I have through the years.  

B.106:  [/Noise].

A.107:  I, I used to make this really neat pie that wa-, was with crackers and
pecans (( )), and you bake it and then you put whipped cream on the top.

B.108:  Oh, that's sounds #good.#

A.109:  #It's just# delicious.  Um, sometimes you can get it at Luby's restaurant.

B.110:  Um.  I, uh, let's see, I usually make a, well, easy stuff as usual, but,
you know, the things that you can buy the ready made crusts and --

A.111:  Uh-huh.

B.112:  -- and then put like, oh, uh, we'll have a chocolate nut pie, #um# --

A.113:  #Um.#

B.114:  -- pie and, you know [breathing],

A.115:  You make up the homemade filling, but you use the --

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  -- (( )).  That's a good idea.

B.118:  Exactly, so,

A.119:  I can't even remem-, oh, I used, I used to make a cheesecake.  It was a
easy recipe, #using# --

B.120:  #Uh-huh.#

A.121:  -- Eagle Brand milk, you know, but it was, it was pretty good.  And there
was a time when I made Grand Boule and English Truffle.

B.122:  I was thinking, I just don't, I don't dare try all that stuff.

A.123:  #[Laughter].#

B.124:  #because# I don't even know if I like it to begin with #[laughter].#

A.125:  #Right [laughter].#

B.126:  If I don't like it, it doesn't get made around here.

A.127:  Oh, that's the way I am.  We haven't bad a baked ham dinner since we've
been married for twenty-five #years.  My,#

B.128:  #[Laughter].#

A.129:  I hate baked ham for dinner [laughter].  My husband's family loved it.
They're Polish and [breathing] they live in New Jersey, and that was one of
their big deals, was baked ham [laughter].

B.130:  So you had to suffer through it when you were there.

A.131:  Oh, God, yeah.  They'd have it a lot of time for Christmas.

B.132:  Uh-huh.
