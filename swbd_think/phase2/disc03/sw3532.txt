========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, you know what happens is, I've tried, I was out because of surgery
last week, so I tried calling a couple of eight o'clock calls, and I got a
person from Utah and a person from New York and a person from New Jersey, so I
thought ((sort of neither)) calling really during the morning.

B.2:  Early in the morning, and you've got somebody from Dal-, uh, 

A.3:  #Out of town.#

B.4:  #Well, I'm from# Mesquite #[laughter].#

A.5:  #[Laughter]# So [throat_clearing] that's why, that's why I've been making
it a habit of calling in the morning.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  [Breathing] But anyway, uh, the topic was the most important benefit of
your job today,

B.8:  #Uh-huh.#

A.9:  #besides# salary and how satisfied are you and everything.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

@A.11:  I'm sort of self-employed, so --

B.12:  Well, I am too --

A.13:  -- #I,# 

B.14:  -- #for# the first time in my life.

A.15:  Really?

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  I'd be at a, a little loss for words on this.  As far as I'm concerned,
most definitely, uh, the most important benefit today would be
hospitalization, and of course retirement and things like --

B.18:  #Uh-huh.#

A.19:  -- #that.#

B.20:  Well, I've worked for a large Fortune Five Hundred company before and never
had the luxury of, uh, benefits, and, uh, at a very small cost.  And, uh,
[breathing] then got out on my own, through no fault of my own.  I was with
Safeway and they left the country.

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  Or left the, uh, north part of the state [breathing] and I find myself in
the insurance industry, and I am finding I, although I don't sell group
insurance or major medical, I sell supplemental health, I'm finding that
every place I go to talk to them about my product [breathing] it's they're in
such a dilemma about, uh, the major medical group market right now.  It's just
not very desirable.  Um [lipsmack], 

A.23:  Well, that's very true.  I can understand that because [breathing] I'm a,
just a small business person.  I run a, my company has five people, but, uh,
they're all straight commission salesmen, so they all provide their own --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- insurance, and it's been that way since nineteen seventy-four, and my
office is just a one person office.  I have myself plus my secretary and --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- she comes in at nine and leaves at five, and, uh, she's on her husband's
insurance program, and I just, uh,

B.28:  So you're fortunate in that manner.

A.29:  Yes.

B.30:  Well, um, I think some of the benefits that are being made available
nowadays, like the four oh one K to the employees --

A.31:  Yes.

B.32:  -- uh, is beneficial.  I was not a participant, or that was not available
when I was employed.  But, uh, I did participate in a stock program, and 
#uh# --

A.33:  #Oh,# that's great.

B.34:  -- [Lipsmack] and that really worked out well for me, when I had been with
the company for thirteen years and now have a, a, you know, a small retirement
set aside, which is, allows me to go on commission sales and, um, and do it,
you know, comfortably.

A.35:  Oh, that's neat.  Are you married?

B.36:  Uh, no, I'm not.

A.37:  Okay, well, I'm married, and my wife's a school teacher, so I'm on her,
they have pretty good insurance.

B.38:  They really #do.#

A.39:  #So# I, they, she carries me on her insurance program, which works out real
well.

B.40:  What, uh, school district is she in?

A.41:  She's in the Plano School District in Plano.

B.42:  Uh-huh.

A.43:  And it's not cheap.  It's like all insurance, insurance just keeps on going
up more and more every day, and, of course, they, the prices they're charging
today and because of the problems they have.

B.44:  Exactly, and the deductibles are going up #and that,# 

A.45:  #Oh,# deductibles are high.

B.46:  Uh-huh.  That's one of the reasons my, uh, what my product is just getting
more and more popular, because it's a catastrophic cancer insurance, intensive
care, and a daily hospital indemnity, and so those kinds of things not only
help a person, um, cover, um, their deductibles, it helps, you know, pay the
rent and, or the mortgage and the --

A.47:  Oh, you bet.

B.48:  -- and the car payments, when, uh, that person has to be off with something
like cancer or --

A.49:  Supplemental --

B.50:  -- #heart attack.#

A.51:  -- #anything# is important today, I'll tell you.

B.52:  Exactly, and #I'm# --

A.53:  #((Whether)).#

B.54:  -- I real, feel real fortunate that I've landed in a, with a really good
company in a good position.

A.55:  Well, that's great.

B.56:  [Lipsmack] And they're really nice too.  One of the benefits of that
company is that they provide me with some stock, um, they give it to me, uh,
three point five percent of what I sell, and, um, uh, annualized premium, and
so this is really going to add up through the years.  I've been doing this
over a year, and have already accumulated quite a bit.

A.57:  Well, that's super.

B.58:  [Lipsmack] So,

A.59:  Well, just, uh, I carry my own Keogh Plan as far as benefits, and I've been
doing that since nineteen seventy-four or seventy-five or whatever and --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- that's more or less my wife's and my retirement.  I'm fifty years old,
my wife is forty-nine,

B.62:  #Uh-huh.#

A.63:  #And# she didn't start teaching till she was forty, so --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- we raised our kids first, and she went back and got her degree and
started teaching, so it looks like we're going to retire in a couple of years
and she'll, uh, she'll qualify for a little something after ten years of,

B.66:  #Uh-huh.#

A.67:  #teaching# but not a whole lot, 

B.68:  #Uh-huh.#

A.69:  #but# it'll be, certainly be useful and #needed.#

B.70:  #Right.#  What kind of business are you in?

A.71:  I'm in the sporting goods business.  I'm a, own a manufacturer's rep firm.

B.72:  I see.

A.73:  And, uh, we represent eighteen different hunting and shooting type
companies, and that's all I've done since --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- I graduated school years ago.

B.76:  #Is that right?#

A.77:  #((sold)).#

B.78:  Well, it's the first time I've been in sales in my life.

A.79:  Really?

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  Oh, it's neat, isn't it?

B.82:  I love it.

A.83:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.84:  #I love it.# I should have been there a long time ago [laughter].
