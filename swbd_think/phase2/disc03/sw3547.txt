=====================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Now where do you live?

A.3:  I live in Richardson, Texas.

B.4:  Oh, well, we're pretty close #then,#

A.5:  #You bet,#  Well, see our subject was gun control.

B.6:  Yes.

A.7:  I'm sort of, uh, prejudiced, prejudiced on this subject because that's my
vocation, that's what I do for a living, 

B.8:  [Laughter].

A.9:  because I'm a, I'm a manufacturer's sales rep and I sell hunting and
shooting supplies working, working for eighteen different companies, so I
guess I would be sort of pro --

B.10:  Well [laughter].

A.11:  -- pro, pro guns (( )).

B.12:  I guess we have something in common then --

A.13:  Okay.

B.14:  -- because I don't think it's guns that are the problem.

A.15:  No.

B.16:  It, it's the people.

A.17:  I agree one hundred percent.

B.18:  I mean, they're just an inanimate object until they are in the hands of
someone who is, who is violent or has a sick, warped mind.

A.19:  I agree with you one hundred percent, Jean.  I'll tell you that somewhere I
saw a bumper sticker years ago, I'd like to see more of them, I think, uh,
speaking from my, my viewpoint, think it read something like, uh, when guns
are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns --

B.20:  Exactly.

A.21:  -- and I think that sort of speaks for itself.  I believe, uh, [inhaling]
in some gun control [breathing] but I think it's, and I, you know, in selling
to the ind-, or selling for the industry to dealers, I think that it's the
federal government's stand that should be taken, and I think that dealers now,
or to by a gun now an individual just has to go in a store and, and show his
drivers license, and if he has a Texas state drivers license, if he lives in
Texas, he can go to any gun dealer and buy a gun merely by filling out a
yellow form and, and paying for the firearm and leaving.

B.22:  With it --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- at the time.

A.25:  It would be handy if they had, you know, computers being like they are, if
they would have some kind of a computer program on a national level where you
could just dial an eight hundred number and, and run a check on someone.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  I would be for something like that.

B.28:  Yes, it would, uh, but then, too, the people who, who have guns already,
um, some of them, they may have had this gun for twelve years before they, uh,
become mentally unbalanced and use it --

A.29:  That's true.

B.30:  -- and otherwise, I mean, if someone is going to get a gun, uh, and is
determined to get a gun and commit some, some act, they're going to get it,
whether they can walk in a store and buy it or if they have to break into a
house across town or something.  You know, they're going to get one.

A.31:  Absolutely.

B.32:  But, uh, no, you and I, I think, have the same idea that [laughter] guns
are not the problem.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  I've heard a lot of people say, why, I wouldn't have a gun in my house.
They're too dangerous.  Ignorance is what's dangerous.

A.35:  You bet.  #Absolutely.#

B.36:  #Uh, I have, uh,# many grandchildren, and they have all been raised in the
house with guns, with loaded guns.  They have been taught the danger of guns,
how to handle them.  Um, from the time, well I had a granddaughter that I
raised, and from the time that she was, um, three or four she knew that the
gun that I had was not to be touched, and that it was dangerous, and I never
had to worry about her --

A.37:  Well, that's wonderful.

B.38:  -- but, any time that she would have friends come, I would put, I had a
closet that would lock, and any gu-, firearms that were loaded, we usually
keep a, uh, twelve gauge shotgun loaded and then my handgun, and any time that
there were other children in the house, I had, I put them in the closet that
locked, just for safety's sake.

A.39:  Well, that's great.  We've always done the same thing, and being in the
business, I've sold guns for twenty-seven years.  I'm fifty-two years old, and
I've sold guns for twenty-seven years, worked for some major manufacturers
like Winchester and people like that, and, and I always consider a, a firearm,
I know they're very dangerous, but I always consider them a sporting firearm,
and I realize that, just as you say, some people don't think of them as that,
but that's how I think of them, being that I'm in the business, but main thing
is just be education and communication on the subject, and that's something
we've always tried to do, and I'm a strong believer in that.

B.40:  Yes, I think that these children that find guns and shoot themselves or
another child, uh, if they, if they knew what they were playing with, they
wouldn't do it --

A.41:  Absolutely right.

B.42:  -- because they would, my son-in-law, one of the, when the boys were just
very, very small, he was educating them about the guns, and he took a
watermelon out and set it up on, uh, this little rise out on the desert where
they lived.

A.43:  Right.
