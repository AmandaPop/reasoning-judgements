REMARKS:        All but the last few pages of the first conversation
were not there.

=======================================================================

B.1:  The last, the last time I had one of these conversations I, you know,
discovered that I, my tastes and, and, and the other persons were very
different.  Uh --

A.2:  Oh, well, that's good.  

B.3:  -- uh, I, my, my own, uh,

@A.4:  So where do you like to dine out?

B.5:  Um, well, sort of yuppie places I guess is probably the best way to
describe them.  Um, places that are comfortable and have sort of unusual
different foods.

A.6:  Oh, I see.  Well, I like the atmosphere myself.  

B.7:  Um, where, where, what do you find particularly good atmosphere wise?

A.8:  Well, I li-, I like, let's, well it depends on the mood I'm in also.

B.9:  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  Sometimes I like to go where there's quiet music and there's a piano bar
and --

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  -- so that we can visit or there's other times when I like when there's
real exciting and there's one place here in Dallas where there's a woman on a
trapeze and she, she goes back and forth over the bar.

B.13:  Well, that sounds different [laughter]. 

A.14:  [Laughter]. 

B.15:  I've seen things like that in movies but it, don't recall having ever been
to a restau-, ever even close to a restaurant where that was an ((option)).

A.16:  Oh, well, that's, that's called Old San Francisco Steak House. 

B.17:  Huh.  

A.18:  And she, uh, swings back and forth over the bar.  

B.19:  {Very faint} Huh.  

A.20:  It's very interesting.  

B.21:  Yeah.  The,

A.22:  She tried, the ceiling is, I don't know how high it is, but she touches the
ceiling,

B.23:  #Yes, yes.# 

A.24:  #with her# toes and then her, 

B.25:  Yeah.  

A.26:  That's kind of interesting.  

B.27:  That sure is.  

A.28:  [Laughter]. 

B.29:  Now, can I top that?  Can I even come close?

A.30:  [Laughter] But, uh, so you like different foods, huh?

B.31:  Sure enough.  Um,

A.32:  What kind, what kind?  

B.33:  Uh, w-, this week it's been Chinese food five days in a row so [laughter],

A.34:  Oh, gee.  

B.35:  Um, but normally not seve-, not so, not so concentrated.  Um, um,
southwestern cuisine, um, you know --

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  -- New York deli kinds of stuff.  

A.38:  Uh-huh.  

B.39:  Uh, you know, it covers, you know, quite a range, I mean, 

A.40:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.41:  #the, the only thing# I find difficulty with is, is the-, these raw fish
things.  Um,

A.42:  Oh, yes.  I can't eat that either.  I do like fish though.  We have a lot
of Red Lobsters out here.

B.43:  #How do you have Red Lobsters,# 

A.44:  #I eat there quite often.# 

B.45:  in Texas, in the middle of Texas?

A.46:  How do we have them?  

B.47:  Yeah.  I would have thought they would come out of, out of the water
somewhere.

A.48:  They're all over.  

B.49:  Crawling around on the, on the, 

A.50:  No, no I mean,  

B.51:  #Around Dallas?# 

A.52:  #the Red Lobsters [laughter].#  That's the name, 

B.53:  #Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.# 

A.54:  #of the restaurant.#  

B.55:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were talking about a kind of food.

A.56:  [Laughter]. 

B.57:  Red lobster, yes, the, the r-, chain.

A.58:  #I'm talking about the restaurant.# 

B.59:  #Yes, thank you.#  Never mind.  

A.60:  [Laughter]. 

B.61:  [Laughter]. 

A.62:  What makes you go back to the same place?  Is it the food or,

B.63:  Well, it's, it's, um, it's a combination of a lot of things.  I mean
there's sort of a value quotient.  I mean, I, I, you know, there's no absolute
dollar limit that, you know, is either okay or not okay.  But it's, it's more
like, gee, this is a really good, you know, you got a lot for your money.
Either one of your,

A.64:  #Oh, and the service too.# 

B.65:  #quality or interest or,# and service and, uh,

A.66:  Right.  The service means a lot to me.  

B.67:  Yes.  

A.68:  A lot.  

B.69:  [Lipsmack] Do you prefer to have men or women as servers?  

A.70:  I really prefer a man.  

B.71:  Uh-huh.  Why is that?  

A.72:  I just, I feel that they're more efficient and they, they just, seems like
they just have it more together.  You go to Mexico and you won't see any women
servers.

B.73:  Yes.  

A.74:  It's all men servers down there.  

B.75:  Yeah, I've never been to Mexico.  What, 

A.76:  #Oh.# 

B.77:  #how,# how, how are the, how is the food in Mexico compared to what we find
in Mexican restaurants?

A.78:  Well, oh, how is the food different there, 

B.79:  #Yeah, compared,#

A.80:  #than up here?# 

B.81:  to what we have in this country?  

A.82:  Well, it's much spicier,

B.83:  Uh-huh.

A.84:  [Throat_clearing] and it's, um, it's just prepared a little bit different
but it's, uh, it has a different flavor to it.  And the service is good
because the, because they have men servers.

B.85:  Uh-huh.  

A.86:  And, uh, do you like men waiters or women?     

B.87:  I, I, I think I probably have a slight preference for, for male servers
but, but not very great.  Um,

A.88:  Huh.  

B.89:  You know, it's the, the quality of service is, is important and it, and
it's, and it's, I don't think that that's, I don't correlate that with
genders.  Um,

A.90:  Huh.

B.91:  I think, I think it really, it might actually just be that, you know, some,
some restaurants (( )) more of one than another.  It may just be the
restaurants I go to.

A.92:  Uh-huh.  Well, I just, I feel like the men have it more together than the
women.

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  They just, I've waited on tables myself and I just could, never seem to
organized like the guys were.

B.95:  How, how did you like being a waiter or waitress?  

A.96:  It's a lot of hard work.  

B.97:  That's, that's what my impression is.  

A.98:  A lot of hard work.  

@@B.99:  And, and, and being a chauffeur that isn't also hard work?

A.100:  A chauffeur?  Yeah.  Really.  Hard to please people.  

B.101:  Yeah.  

A.102:  Just like waiting on tables, you just can't, whatever you do sometimes you
just can't please them.

B.103:  Yeah.  Is this, is this one of these limo services where people coming into
town and want to be driven around and,

A.104:  Uh-huh.
