REMARKS:        Speaker B dominated the conversation and was very
hard to transcribe as his speech was uneven.  Also, he used "uh"
quite a bit.

=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, go ahead and, uh, tell me what you're looking for in a job now.

B.2:  Oh, one thing that I look for is, uh, well, maybe not the most important
thing, but, benefits like, uh, [breathing] health insurance for my family.

A.3:  Okay.  

B.4:  And another thing would be, uh, [lipsmack] reasonable work hours, uh, good
working environment.  Uh, right now I think it's, we're supposed to talk
about, uh, our current situation.  I'm a post doctoral fellow and,

A.5:  A what?  

B.6:  A post doctoral [lipsmack] fellow. 

A.7:  Okay.

B.8:  Uh, I, I'm, it's for the training beyond your doctorate degree.

A.9:  Okay.  

B.10:  And I get the same benefits as the regular staff at the University.  I work
at the University of Iowa.  And, I, I like, I like working at the University.
One of the benefits there is you get a lot of flexibility in when you work and
when you want to take time off.  For example, this Christmas I have about
three weeks that I get to go out west to visit my family and so that's pretty
good.  You, it, would probably be hard to have something like that in another
type of job.

A.11:  So you like ha-, having the flexibility to be able to take off time when
you want to?  That's important --

B.12:  #Oh, yeah.# 

A.13:  -- #to you.#

B.14:  Besides, besides some semester breaks th-, there is also other, uh,
[lipsmack] other times, too.  Uh, [lipsmack] like during the summer and things
like that.

A.15:  Does, uh, recognition from others and a sense of contributing to the
organization's success, does that rank pretty high for you?

B.16:  Oh, yes, and that's one of the reasons [breathing] I'm at the University,
too, because you do get credit for your own work.  Uh, [breathing] my ad-, my
mentor here especially.  He used to work in industry but he couldn't stand it
because, uh, [lipsmack] he felt like that his boss at, uh, at this aero-, p-,
space company where he worked, uh, his supervisor got credit for all the, uh,
achievements that he made so that's why he came back to the University.

A.17:  Yeah, that's, that's kind of a rip when you feel that way.  

B.18:  So, I think at the University you get, of-, get credit for m-, you know,
your name gets on what you do, like when you publish articles and things like
that.

A.19:  Hey, David, what is your doctorate in?  

B.20:  Uh, [lipsmack] it's in physics.  However, uh, [lipsmack] you know, there is
s-, several branches within physics.  I, I studied sound, acoust-, and the
subject for that is called acoustics.

A.21:  Sure.  

B.22:  And I'm specifically interested in the acoustics of speech.  I'm working
now at the National Center for Voice and Speech that's located here at the
University of Iowa.

A.23:  So you're kind of interested in this thing that we're participating in
then.

B.24:  Oh, I found out about it because I attended, uh, [lipsmack] a conference
for the Acoustical Society of America in Texas and, uh, [lipsmack] the
chairman of the session where a presented a paper, uh, uh, is it Mister
Godfrey, he, uh, was, uh, [lipsmack] he, he gave me, a, a thing and said to
try and find others to help join for this project.

A.25:  Huh.  And, so you're enjoying all the benefits that a professor would at
the moment.  Is there,

B.26:  Oh, I couldn't say that.  

A.27:  Well, I meant as --

B.28:  Uh,  

A.29:  -- health and, uh,  

B.30:  I, I don't get a, the salary -- 

A.31:  Oh, yeah.  

B.32:  -- for one thing.  Nor the job stability, p-, a p-, post doctoral fellow is
only for two years, but the ultimate goal usually of a doctoral fellowship is
probably to go on and accept a position at a University.  So this is, uh,
[lipsmack] you know, the economy with the Gulf War and everything, uh, last
year around the time I was graduating, uh, there was just were not very many
opportunities available.  So this was the best thing because, uh, my post
doctoral fellowship like this, uh, uh, is a good thing on your resume for when
you apply to be a professor or something like that.

A.33:  Okay, uh, David, is one of the things that I, I suppose so, you don't want
to be out in the weather and, uh, the environment like construction workers.
For you it's better to be inside, air-conditioned, w-, warm.

B.34:  Uh, yeah, especially, uh, with the humidity here in Iowa.  Yes, I, I, I
would, uh, definitely want a indoors job.  Uh, do you have a, uh,

A.35:  I work as a E D P auditor and, yeah, I've got a degree and a bunch of
different certifications that go along with,
