REMARKS:        Speaker A sounded like he was chewing throughout
the entire conversation.  Speaker B did not come in as clearly as
Speaker A.

=======================================================================

A.1:   For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.

B.2:   Oh, okay, so it's right up your alley, then.  

A.3:   I suppose so.  Let me push the button.  

B.4:   All right.  

@A.5:   [Beep]  Okay, uh, I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching
to the metric system, but, uh, I sense that it's not going to
happen anytime soon.  

B.6:   Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen either, but I wish it
were because I'm a, I got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering. 

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   I'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric
stuff.  

A.9:   You're now in what?  

B.10:   Acoustics.  

A.11:   Acoustics, uh.  

B.12:   Yeah, so everything's metric and then you go to read some
order book or something and it's all confusing so I don't
understand as much, so I think we should get one adopted
permanently.  

A.13:   Well, I guess that is the policy, but it's been the policy for
a long time and nothing ever happens.  Uh, I suppose things, some
things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools
more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation
come up that's more used to it.  

B.14:   Yeah, a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff
because they have to.  

A.15:   They have to for international trade.  

B.16:   Yeah.  

A.17:   But, I g-, guess it's, it's easier to switch back and forth
than it used to be, uh, be-, be-, because of, of, uh, of computers
coming into everything.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that
big a deal.  I think people need to understand more like what a
meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something.  Just
get used to using all the terms.  Because someone says a kilogram,
no one knows what that is.  

A.19:   Everyone wants a, wants a conversion of that before kind of
recognizing it as a, as, as, as, as a concept to hold in mind.  

B.20:   Yeah.  

A.21:   Uh, I, I, I don't see that, it, it, it can change it very
quickly.  I mean we're not the kind of society that, that, uh, that
something can be posed upon, uh, by government will.  

B.22:   Yeah, no one seems to be adopting it.  Metric system, no one's
very, uh, no one wants it at all seems like.  

A.23:   Uh, the, the, the public is just very conservative that way in
refusing to change measurement systems, uh, money, dollar, coins,
anything like that.  

B.24:   Yeah [laughter].  

A.25:   And, and, and it [breathing], it obviously makes no sense
that we're practically alone in the world in, in using the old
system.  

B.26:   Yeah, I, it's pretty tough when you get everything confused,
though.  I think two systems is worse than one, though [laughter]. 
Because, I know, we do a lot of problems and things and they're
half english and half metric and [noise] you, you make more
mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the
problems.  (( )) just get one.  I prefer metric, but even if it's
english, they should just have one.  

A.27:   Well, I mean, unfortunate-, I think people like you are
relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day. 

B.28:   [Laughter] Yeah [laughter], yeah, I think so.  Your, your
average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles
it is to his destination.  

A.29:   [Lipsmack] Uh, I mean, there are things you could do.  Uh, we
have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty-five
miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour.  

B.30:   Yeah.  

A.31:   Uh, but that hasn't been adopted very widely.  

B.32:   Yeah, they have some of those in Ohio.  There's this one
sign's kind of funny.  It says, uh, metric signs next hundred
miles.  

A.33:   [Laughter]. 

B.34:   [Laughter]. 

A.35:   [Lipsmack] But, I mean, and no one will, will go a step
further to remove the english signs.  

B.36:   Yeah, that would force everybody to use it.  Or to quit
selling tape measures in inches.  

A.37:   Uh, yeah, or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, uh,
eighty, eighty-five, whatever would be the appropriate number.  

B.38:   Yeah, I guess a hundred is sixty-two.  

A.39:   Hundred car is going sixty-two, yeah, so it would be more
like, uh, like ninety I guess, car is going fifty-five.  Uh, you
suddenly have a [laughter] have a even worse problem with speeding
than we do now.  

B.40:   Yeah, you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety
[laughter].  

A.41:   Do, do, do you know, where you are, do the schools emphasize
the metric system?  

B.42:   Yeah, in the engineering they all do pretty much.  

A.43:   No, I, I, I meant, I meant down, like, in the elementary
schools.  

B.44:   Oh, in the elementary schools.  I don't know.  I wouldn't
think so.  I remember -- 

A.45:   I mean, I think,  

B.46:   -- a ways back we did like conversions, but we never actually
went out and measured anything or did anything on one system.  

A.47:   Yeah, I mean, I think my children learned the metric system,
but it doesn't get, get emphasized over the other.  

B.48:   Yeah, they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and
that's about it.
