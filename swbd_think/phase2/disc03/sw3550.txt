A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  All right.

A.3:  Go ahead.

B.4:  Well, what kind of car would I want to buy.

@A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  I don't know.  The question is, I mean, would I want to buy, or would I,
would I probably actually [laughter] buy.  May be two different things.

A.7:  Oh, well, if you, if you had all your, all the money in the world or
something.

B.8:  If I had all the money I wanted, then that's whole different matter.

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  No, in that case, I'd, I'd, I don't know.  I, I, my dream car for years was
a, was a Porsche --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- Turbo (( )). 

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  But, uh, I don't know if I'd want one of those now.

A.15:  Oh, really?

B.16:  Of course I would want one if somebody was --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- was given to me.  But I maybe would buy a B M W.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  Uh, or, or even a Volvo.

A.21:  What do you have now?

B.22:  I've got a, uh, a Dodge Daytona.

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  It's actually the first car we ever bought new.

A.25:  Oh, really.  Yeah, we just, we, well, I have my car is the first one we
ever bought new, too.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  But we just bought another used car, a couple weeks ago, actually.

B.28:  Uh-huh, yeah me too [laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter].

B.30:  So what car do you drive?  What is it?

A.31:  Uh, mine is a Honda Accord.

B.32:  Uh-huh, we almost bought one of those.  Do you like it?

A.33:  Yeah, I do, and, and, um, it's funny because, after I bought it, I was
doing a lot of business traveling, and I, some of the cars that I got were
like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- and, um, I don't like them as well except, it wasn't really a fair
comparison because those were automatics, and mine is a standard --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- and the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot
better --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- it had a lot more pickup and everything.

B.40:  Yeah, you get a little more control over when --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- when it's doing the things it's doing.  Yeah.  Uh, what, what rental
agent did you go to to actually rent --

A.43:  Um --

B.44:  -- to rent those kind of cars.

A.45:  -- usually AVIS.

B.46:  To what, AVIS?

A.47:  AVIS.

B.48:  Really.

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  Huh.  I guess,

A.51:  It's just because we're on, I think of it, I'm not sure those are AVIS or
not, but we have corporate contracts --

B.52:  I see.

A.53:  -- you know, with the various companies --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- so it depends on your destination, too.  

B.56:  Right.

A.57:  Kind of strange [laughter].

B.58:  You work for a big company, then.

A.59:  Work for T I.

B.60:  T I, I see.

A.61:  Uh-huh, which is how I heard about this [laughter].

B.62:  Uh-huh.  Um, but [laughter] yeah, I, I, uh, I don't know, I would probably,
if I were to buy a car mys-, you know, with the constraints of real money --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- I probably would, would go with something like, you know, like a Honda
Accord.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  Maybe it would, one thing I, I really liked about, about the Dodge Daytona
is the fact that they have, uh, this seven year warranty.

A.67:  Oh, really.

B.68:  Um, and it really saved us some big money once.

A.69:  It did, huh.

B.70:  Yeah, they had a whole bunch of things that, that sort of broke at the same
time [laughter] --

A.71:  Oh, my gosh.

B.72:  -- and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars, and I had to
pay twenty five for the, 

A.73:  Oh, that was great.

B.74:  Yeah, [laughter] it was.

A.75:  That's unusual to hear, usually, you know something breaks, you look at the
warranty and it's excluded.

B.76:  Well, we, we bought the extended, the the extension --

A.77:  Oh, I see, okay.

B.78:  -- and, uh, at the time we bought it it was like, you know, I don't know,
four hundred and twenty-five dollars or something extra.

A.79:  Oh, you got your money's worth.

B.80:  Yeah, we did, but, you know, we really debated at the beginning, and --

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  -- of course I'm glad I did it.

A.83:  Yeah, that is good.

B.84:  But, um, we still have, we still have like, you know, coup-, three years
left on it.

A.85:  Yeah, well, I've been lucky.  Mine hasn't had any trouble except last week
a shopping cart crashed into it --

B.86:  Oh, no.

A.87:  -- but I was real lucky because it just hit the, um --

B.88:  Bumper?

A.89:  -- the lens to the light. 

B.90:  Oh.

A.91:  It didn't actually dent the car or anything.  So it cost me twenty-five
bucks to replace --

B.92:  Well, that was good.

A.93:  -- that, and --

B.94:  Are you.

A.95:  -- the store will pay for it anyway, so.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  No big deal.

B.98:  Um, if you were, if you were going to, uh, buy a new car would you buy
another, uh, another Accord?

A.99:  Um, I probably wouldn't, just because I already have one --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- but, you know, if I had to make the choice again, I, yeah, I, I'm
perfectly happy with what I decided --

B.102:  Uh-huh.

A.103:  -- um, although we did just buy another car, and that's a Legend --

B.104:  Oh, yeah, those are nice (( )).

A.105:  -- um, but it's, it's a used one --

B.106:  Uh-huh.

A.107:  -- and, um, my husband has really wanted one for a long time, and the fact
that, you know, this c-, this car that I have has performed so well, and
before that I also had an Accord, it was a real old one --

B.108:  Uh-huh.

A.109:  -- and, uh, I bought that used.  I had absolutely no money to my name and
bought that, and it served me real well, too.

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  So he's been impressed with all the Honda cars.

B.112:  Right.

A.113:  And.

B.114:  Yeah, my sister drives one.  She drives a, uh, I don't know, is it 
Legend --

A.115:  Uh-huh.

B.116:  -- it's a, I'm not certain, [laughter] but she's liked it.  Um, 

A.117:  Yeah.

B.118:  But, I, I have, I have never had, and we, in fact, what I'm driving right
now, we bought a, we only had one car for a long time, and --

A.119:  Uh-huh.

B.120:  -- and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back
and forth, 

A.121:  [Laughter].

B.122:  four miles to work and back --

A.123:  Uh-huh.

B.124:  -- kind of thing.  And so, uh, I bought a used Yugo --

A.125:  Uh-huh.

B.126:  -- just to be a little, you know, little car that I could care less 
about --

A.127:  Yeah.

B.128:  -- (( )).

A.129:  How did it go for you?

B.130:  Oh, well, it's, uh, it's worked.

A.131:  [Laughter] Hasn't left you stranded.

B.132:  I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know, it's just a, it's a cheap
little --

A.133:  Yeah I know.

B.134:  -- little car just to go, you know, run around town in --

A.135:  Yeah.

B.136:  -- and, uh.  It's actually kind of fun to drive.  I, I, you know, getting
back in the Daytona now, I almost don't like it.  You know --

A.137:  Really.

B.138:  -- it's like too, too mushy, and it, you know --

A.139:  Huh.

B.140:  -- it's an automatic, and  --

A.141:  Well, that's what my husband thinks about my car now, that he's had the
Legend --

B.142:  -- it's too, the steering --

A.143:  -- it's windy.

B.144:  -- you know, you feel like you're in a boat or something, you know, it's
kind of,

A.145:  I can't drive that, the Legend, it's just so huge.

B.146:  Oh.

A.147:  I, I don't like it, and it's so, uh,
