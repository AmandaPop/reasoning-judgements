===========================================================================

A.1:  Um, [throat_clearing] you know, I, uh, I'm a speech pathology major and I
see quite a few advantages to, uh, having, uh, some kind of public, uh, health
insurance where a lot of the, [throat_clearing] maybe a lot of people who
couldn't afford to pay for insurance would be guaranteed some form of
insurance anyway.

B.2:  Well, I'm, I'm certainly for something too.  Uh, my husband and I've been
self-employed for about fifteen years.

A.3:  Oh, yeah?  

B.4:  And, uh, we pay like, we're in our fifties, and we pay like three hundred
dollars a month but it's for nothing.  I mean --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- and it only pays if you're in the hospital.  

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  So we pay our own, uh, you know, outpatient care, our own prescriptions.
 
A.9:  Wow.  

B.10:  All that sort of thing which tha-, all that can run, you know, two or three
thousand --

A.11:  Oh, sure.  

B.12:  -- a year.  Uh, just with simple stuff, 

A.13:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.14:  #and# if we got the other kind that covered all this, it would be six or
seven hundred a month for the two of us see.

A.15:  Wow.  

B.16:  That's why we do it the way we do.  

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  And you know, it, n-, it goes up every year, 

A.19:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.20:  #you know,# so t-, by the time we get close to Medicare, I mean we've got a
few more [laughter] years.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  

B.22:  It may be a thousand.  I look at medical care as being our biggest amount
to pay out in retirement.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  I mean more than a house payment more than, 

A.25:  #Right.#  

B.26:  #anything# else.  

A.27:  Right.  Exactly.   

B.28:  The way it is now.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  So how are you covered with, since you work part-time?  

A.31:  Um, well, I, I'm kind of lucky.  I have a, [throat_clearing] I'm in
graduate school right now --

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- and so I have a job waiting for me when I get out of school.

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  And they're covering my, they're paying me, uh, uh, a little bit a month to
go to school.  And then they're, they're paying, they're also paying my ins-,
uh, giving me insurance, full insurance.  #Uh,#

B.36:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.37:  so, #that makes, yeah,# 

B.38:  #But yeah,# and you're probably what?  In your twenties?  

A.39:  Yeah, I'm twenty-two.  

B.40:  Yeah, see you, you don't, n-, it doesn't, you know, it's as you get older
that this all,

A.41:  #Yeah.# 

B.42:  #gets# higher and higher, 

A.43:  #Exactly.# 

B.44:  #you know,# and, and if you ever get anything bad wrong with you, well, not
even bad just something ((small)) --

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  -- uh, then, and you can't find anybody that will insure you, 

A.47:  #Right.# 

B.48:  #you know,# if you're not with a big company.  

A.49:  Exactly.  

B.50:  And probably fifty, sixty percent of the people in the United States
probably aren't with a great big company.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  Right.  Wha-, wha-, what concerns me especially are the, um,
[throat_clearing] I remember when I was an undergraduate there were a lot of,
uh, families that I, I worked with their kids.  You know they couldn't afford
insurance, you know, to, to pay for, uh, [throat_clearing] a lot of the
services they receive.  They, they receive some from Medicare but, um, boy
they, they just, they just weren't suffici-, the, you know, the funds weren't
sufficient to cover everything,

B.52:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.53:  #that the,# that the families needed.  

B.54:  And so many people, if they're not with a big company nowadays, they just
can't carry it.  Uh, I have a brother who he and his wife had been with a big
company and their, they got disfi-, satisfied and left and decided they wanted
to go in the restaurant business.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  Well, when I saw him a few weeks ago I was horrified when I, when he said
they had no insurance.  He said, we looked into it, it's going to be six or
seven hundred dollars a month, so we just couldn't afford it,

A.57:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.58:  #you know.# 

A.59:  Rather take the risk.  

B.60:  So, yeah, that's what they're doing.  Taking the risk, 

A.61:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.# 

B.62:  #you know.# And they're supposed to be something like what thirty-eight
million people in the United States have no insurance.

A.63:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.64:  Well, you can see why -- 

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  -- as high as it is.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  Wh-, wh-, wh-, do you think that, do you think that, uh,
government, um, insurance is the, is the answer for all of that?

B.68:  Uh, [sigh] well, right now I, I can't think of anything else that, of
course, every, everybody you know knows that the government gets into
something then there's all this,

A.69:  #[Laughter].# 

B.70:  #bureaucracy,# 

A.71:  #Uh-huh, right.# 

B.72:  #and [laughter] you know, all this# money wasted in, in, uh, uh,
implementing it,

A.73:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.74:  #I guess,#  

A.75:  #Yeah.#

B.76:  #you'd say.#

A.77:  Yeah.  

B.78:  But I don't know what else, you know, it, uh, and I, I tried to listen to
like other, you know, Canada has a national health --

A.79:  Exactly.   

B.80:  -- program.  And I think England has for years, 

A.81:  #Yes, uh-huh.# 

B.82:  #I think.# But again these are smaller countries and you don't always know
if what will work for a smaller population country will work, is affordable
here.

A.83:  #Right.# 

B.84:  #I don't know.# Uh, I just really, you know, wish they would look at every
aspect of it and I, I'd certainly be happy for it to be more of a uniform
thing.

A.85:  Uh-huh.  The only thing that [throat_clearing] I, I agree with you on, I
especially, you know, I,
