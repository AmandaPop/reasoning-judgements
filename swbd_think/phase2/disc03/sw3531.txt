=========================================================================

A.1:   Uh,   

B.2:   [Laughter]. 

A.3:   [Laughter].

B.4:   You could go first perhaps -- 

A.5:   Okay [laughter].  

B.6:   -- on this one [laughter].  

A.7:   I'll start, uh, funding, I think that in light of the
seriousness of it, of the fact that, that by what, uh, I think they
said by the year two thousand there will be at least five, is it
five thousand a year or more.  

B.8:   Is that what it is --  

A.9:   Uh,   

B.10:   -- statistically?  

A.11:   Yeah, we'll be dying from it and I know, uh, what is it, uh,
over in Africa it's just [noise] already in horrendous, uh,   

B.12:   Right, truly an epidemic.  

A.13:   Yeah, it really is, so, in light of that, I think that, that
we're probably going to have to increase the funding for research. 
I think that, uh, I don't know,  

B.14:   [Throat_clearing]. 

A.15:   if they have it, but it looks like to me that all the
countries could go together and have like a joint AIDS research
program.  I don't know if they -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   -- already have one of those -- 

B.18:   Uh-huh.  

A.19:   -- where everybody could put in their input.  

B.20:   Do you know if that exists today if, a -- 

A.21:   I don't know.  

B.22:   -- cross country kind of collective?  

A.23:   I don't know, I don't, I don't hear about research that much
except in the terms of what the United States is doing and the
celebrities that's, you know, the benefits and things that they put
on -- 

B.24:   Uh-huh.  

A.25:   -- for AIDS -- 

B.26:   Uh-huh.  

A.27:   -- research.  I do, I did hear about, uh, Africa and, uh, how
rampant it is over there.  

B.28:   Yes.  

A.29:   And I know, uh, in talking to, I have a relative that works
for, uh, state welfare in Oklahoma, the AIDS children that are
coming in with it, uh -- 

B.30:   Yeah.  

A.31:   -- it, I mean, it, it's b-, it's tragic, it's just absolutely
horrible and it's, you know, it's not just homosexuals, it's, you
know, heterosexuals, it's, you know, the drug users, it's -- 

B.32:   Exactly.  

A.33:   -- innocent people that, you know, go in for blood
transfusions.  So I mean it's starting to affect everyone.  

B.34:   Do you think that the visibility, uh, is part of what is
keeping it in the limelight, the fact that the funding sources are
being discussed so, so regularly, uh, is because, uh, of the nature
of the disease, the fact that it's such a terrible way to die and
so on?  

A.35:   I think that probably partly is it.  I think that it is, has
received so much more publicity since we have had well-known
actors, athletes -- 

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- everything come down with it.  I think that, uh, I do agree
with someone when, uh, Magic Johnson announced, uh, there was a,
uh, spokesperson for the gay community that came out and said that,
you know, it would not be receiving this much publicity if it
wasn't for someone like Magic Johnson and it would be, you know,
very interesting to see,   

B.38:   It's true, it's a different level of publicity.  

A.39:   That's right.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   That's right, and I think it, it, I think it makes people more
aware that it hits other than just the gay community.  

B.42:   Sure.  

A.43:   And, uh, but I do think that, that in light of the in fact
that it's going to hit all of us, I think, what are they saying by
the year two thousand, I think it's one in three is supposed to
have it.  You know, it, it, because it, it is, it's spreading --  

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   -- so rapidly.  

B.46:   I agree with you, I do believe that there should be a greater
amount of, uh, funding sources set aside for it, but I, I know that
the visibility of it is part of what is causing it to get this
attention now and I would hope that the emphasis would continue
over the long term.  I mean, I'm surprised to see the numbers of,
uh, people who, for example, who, women who have breast cancer and
have died are even greater than the number of people who have died
from AIDS -- 

A.47:   Oh, I didn't realize that.  

B.48:   -- on a regular basis.  That the statistics are higher and
yet, it's such a benign kind of a thing.  It seems like it's been
with us for a long time and it's such a,   

A.49:   Well, it is, I know that I, I heard another conversation
regarding AIDS, the fact that, that, you know, cancer is not
receiving this and yet is, is cancer growing at such a rapid rate. 

B.50:   That may be the other issue.  

A.51:   You know, it's, it's,   

B.52:   That it's, it's reaching epidemic proportions.  

A.53:   You know, and I think that's what is scaring people is that it
is reaching such epidemic proportions.  

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   You know, where is, is cancer on the r-, is it rising as
rapidly -- 

B.56:   Uh-huh.  

A.57:   -- you know, as, for instance, AIDS, you know.  Uh,   

B.58:   Yes, and I don't know that.  It -- 

A.59:   I don't, I don't know -- 

B.60:   -- may not be.  

A.61:   -- either, you know, it, it's just, uh, and granted, I, I do
think that because of the publicity and because of the people, you
know, getting it and everything, I think that, that people are more
aware of it than, you know, say if, you know, someone just dies
with cancer.  

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   Which is -- 

B.64:   Uh-huh.  

A.65:   -- it's a tragic way, I mean, you know -- 

B.66:   Uh-huh.  

A.67:   -- it's tragic that it's that way.  

B.68:   Uh-huh.  I, I look at the community resources that were
dedicated to, uh, those with cancer in terms of transitional living
environments and, uh, volunteer services and those sorts of things.
