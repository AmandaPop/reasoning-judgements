=======================================================================

A.1:  I'm kind of ((ambivalent)) myself.  Uh, oh, we, we have that kind of a
program at, uh, at work but, uh, I'm not crazy about it myself.

B.2:  Well, I think that it can be, um, a hassle but considering some of the
things we picked up, um, I think it's, I think it means as much to get a clean
one.  I think being able to prove that you're clean is, is quite beneficial to
an employee.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Especially when there's been an accident of some kind or, you know,
something didn't go right.

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  I know our company requires it before, uh, employment and then if there's
an accident on the job they require it.

A.7:  Oh, right.  

B.8:  And I, does your company do the same?   

A.9:  [Throat_clearing] Um, 

B.10:  #On an accident?# 

A.11:  #they,# they require it before, uh, employment as, as a condition of
employment.

B.12:  Yes.  

A.13:  And then, uh, they have random testing.  

B.14:  Okay.  

A.15:  I don't know about after accidents because industrial accidents I guess are
relatively rare at T I.

B.16:  Well, we hope they are at ours too but that's just in our policy and
procedures.

A.17:  [Cough] Yeah.  

B.18:  But, uh, we, uh, 

A.19:  #I really,# 

B.20:  #I think# in, in a way it's a protection for the employee.   

A.21:  [Cough]. 

B.22:  Because they can say that, uh, it definitely wasn't their fault [laughter]
if their work on, you know, hurt on the job.

A.23:  I guess you could view it that way.  

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  [Cough]  I tend to be more concerned about, uh, where it will go from
here,

B.26:  #Yeah.# 

A.27:  #and, uh,# also I [cough] not convinced that the, at least the kind of
people that I work with, I'm not convinced that that's really, uh, doing much
for the progr-, for the, uh, drug problem.

B.28:  Oh?  Well, I think, uh, 

A.29:  [Cough].

B.30:  the sensitiveness of either one of other professions requires complete
ability to think properly.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  And I think from that viewpoint it's not a bad idea but, uh, I'm not sure
that the random testing, I'm not so sure.  But I think if, um, if there's any
suspicion that a person is using drugs, I think the employer should be able to
do a little bit of testing.

A.33:  Yeah.  For cause.  

B.34:  Oh, yeah.  

A.35:  For cause.  I just, um, I'm not convinced that, that wheeling all this
machinery in place and testing a lot of, uh, uh, people who as far as I can
tell, uh, I, I think the yield is very low.

B.36:  Yeah, it is.  

A.37:  Uh -- 

B.38:  ((Even around here.)) 

A.39:  -- it's, uh, a lot of expense I know for -- 

B.40:  Oh, it is.  

A.41:  -- companies that aren't #doing well.# 

B.42:  #Uh-huh.# It's a lot of trouble too because most of the time especially for
T I, they have to do ((chain)) of custody.  And, uh, with even with the money
we charge for it --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- it, uh, it doesn't, it's not a money maker [laughter]. 

A.45:  No.  

B.46:  Not at all but we, we do have in our particular facility we have a special
area where, uh, we do special toxicology work and, uh, the security involved
is tremendous.  So it's, uh, one of those things that I know, at least in our
area is it provides ((properly)),

A.47:  #Yeah.#  

B.48:  #which# should be, you know, kind of comforting to people who have to have
it done [laughter].

A.49:  Yeah.  Well, I haven't been, uh, selected for random testing yet, but I'm
not,

B.50:  #Well,# 

A.51:  #looking# forward to it.  

B.52:  Oh, well, all you have to do is go in and give a specimen then go on your
merry way.

A.53:  Yeah, I understand that [cough]. 

B.54:  Yeah.

A.55:  #But I'm more,# 

B.56:  #Don't have to (( )).# 

A.57:  something of a civil libertarian I guess.  

B.58:  Oh, well.  

A.59:  And, uh, I think, uh, I'm just worried about what, what they'll do next.

B.60:  Well, yeah, there's some of the tests that, uh, I think, uh, still we have
a right to privacy.

A.61:  Yeah.  Particularly if there, uh, I'm worried about this business of, uh,
[cough] detecting everything that could be possibly wrong with anybody and
then adjusting health insurance accordingly.

B.62:  Oh, yes, I am.  

A.63:  [Cough] #They're going to start, there's,# 

B.64:  #I know when# some of the disclaimers came out, you know, and permissions
you had to give on health insurance --

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  -- uh, right at first, I had this young lady read it.  I said I want you to
be sure and read this before you sign it.  She read it, she said, I think I'll
go call my lawyer.

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  She came back in she says, I don't think I want this.  I said I thought, I
didn't think you might [laughter].

A.69:  Right.  

B.70:  But you sign away your right.

A.71:  I'm afraid they'll start, uh, picking out people with every possible type
of risk factor,

B.72:  #Oh, yeah.# 

A.73:  #and trying to# exclude them from health coverage.  

B.74:  Well, they do that to some extent already.  

A.75:  Yeah [cough].  #So, that, that,# 

B.76:  #(( )) we went# into that.  

A.77:  Right.  Drug testing could, uh --

B.78:  It could.  

A.79:  -- could be the first step towards that so I hope they do it very, very
carefully and, uh, uh --

B.80:  Well, um,

A.81:  -- except that's it's to what the, to the peoples privacy.  

B.82:  Uh-huh.  We do them, um, for the people.  I have a, have a program where we
can do them for the individual.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  Which is a little unusual but I'm ((sure they all)) (( )),
