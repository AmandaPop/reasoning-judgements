========================================================================

A.1:  Well, wha-, what do you feel?  Do you feel that, that our government, uh,
is it possible to have an honest government, or do we have an honest
government?

B.2:  Um, [lipsmack] well, I feel that for, I feel there's a lot of shenanigans
going on.  I feel there's a lot of crookedness in it, but I do feel that for
the most part, um, our government is, you know, trying, trying to make things
work the best they can.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Um, how about you?

A.5:  Well [throat_clearing], uh, I'm, I'm rather young, I'm only twenty-two --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- and so [throat_clearing], uh, my knowledge is based, you know, #mostly,#

B.8:  #Uh-huh.#

A.9:  on what I read, you know, in history.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  But I do think, based on what I read, uh, what I've read thr-, uh, a-,
about our history of our government, I think things are getting better.

B.12:  Oh, #((uh-huh)).#

A.13:  #Uh,# in the, in the last, maybe ten or fifteen years, where [breathing]
Americans are becoming a little more aware and, uh, are forcing our government
to be, uh, on top of integrity.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  You know #(( )).#

B.16:  #Right,# right, I agree, but the people are demanding that, that those that
aren't, you know, that aren't either morally or, or politically or going to do
a good job, that they're, they're trying to get them out of it, or at least
they're taking a stand --

A.17:  Uh-huh, yeah, yeah.

B.18:  -- against it, so, um, [baby_talking] I know [laughter] a lot of the well,
in our community you know, the government, the leaders here --

A.19:  {Faint} Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- I feel like they're all, all real good people that are trying their best
to, to [/baby_talking] provide a service to the community and --

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  -- when you think that most of the, most of the politicians, I'm, I'm not
really sure what the pay scales are and, and how that, that works, but, um, I
don't agree with some of the ways that they, they earn extra money #on the
side [laughter].#

A.23:  #[Breathing] Uh-huh, yeah.#

B.24:  You know, I feel that [baby_talking], that, that that needs to be changed
and, and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they,
they earn their money.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Have you ever ran for a public office?

A.27:  Have #I?#

B.28:  #Probably# not.  Yeah, probably not, being twenty-two #[laughter].#

A.29:  #No, not yet,# huh-uh.

B.30:  Not yet.  Um, my husband ran one time here in, uh, our little community,
and he ran, you know, for the town board and --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- and we felt like it was a, a real good experience.  I think that, um,
you know, when people are wanting to get involved, to, to, to make changes for
the better in the community, that it's, that it's a good thing #so,#

A.33:  #Right.# Does it worry you that, um, [throat_clearing] say someone like
David Duke got such, such publicity during, uh, during his campaign and that,
and that now he's running for, uh, 

B.34:  [Laughter].

A.35:  thinking of running for president?  Does that worry you #at all?#

B.36:  #Yeah,# yeah, that does worry me #[laughter].#

A.37:  #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  Especially when, with his background.

A.39:  Uh-huh, #yeah.#

B.40:  #You know,# and the people have already voted him down, I, I don't
understand really --

A.41:  {Faint} Yeah.

B.42:  -- really his reasons for doing that.  {Faint} I don't, 

A.43:  I, I don't know either. 

B.44:  I don't know [talking] what he's,  

A.45:  I hope he doesn't know something we [breathing] or #I,#

B.46:  #Yeah.#

A.47:  ho-, yeah, hope he doesn't know something we don't #[laughter].#

B.48:  #((That's right)) [laughter].# Yeah.  I was, I'm interested in, um, our
state is looking for a new governor and we #have,#

A.49:  #{Faint} Uh-huh.#

B.50:  had, oh, I think the number is seven already that are running for it, and
this is not #until,#

A.51:  #Wow.#

B.52:  next year, that have put, [baby_crying] you know, their hat in, in, in the
ring to run them.  And I was surprised by that, because it had seemed to me
like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run
because of the reason that, you know, they dredge up every single thing in
#your past.#

A.53:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.54:  I mean, and not very many people want to lay their, their whole life on
#the line like that and say, hey,#

A.55:  #[Laughter].#

B.56:  I, you know, I've never made any mistakes and --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- I think that would be a little bit frightening to --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- to be put in the public eye like that myself.  But we've had it here in
the state, a lot of people that are going to run for, for governor, and it
seems like there's a lot of people that are starting to talk about running for
president again.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  You know, when, when Bush is, when he's finished, #so,#

A.63:  #Yeah.#

B.64:  Um, what do you think about the different, you know, the different formats,
the Republican and Democrat?

A.65:  Well, #[throat_clearing] uh,#

B.66:  #Do you think [talking] the parties# are a good thing, or do you think they
need to be done away with or, 

A.67:  I'm kind of disappointed that, that, uh, the two parties have such a
stronghold in the, in the nation --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- because i-, if, if you belong to any other party, uh, you know, any
other platform, I should say [breathing] --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- uh, yo-, you're not represented #um,#

B.72:  #Uh-huh.#

A.73:  I, I don't.  I don't belong to any particular, uh, platform and, and I
don't think I ever will.  But --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- I'm afraid that, um, [breathing] [throat_clearing] I think his name was
Anderson, was the, the gentleman who ran for, uh, on an independent ticket
against #Reagan,#

B.76:  #Oh,# 

A.77:  and --

B.78:  yes, uh-huh.

A.79:  -- uh, Carter #[breathing].#

B.80:  #Yes.#

A.81:  Um, I was real disappointed that, uh, uh, that he didn't, he didn't have a
chance, #uh,#

B.82:  #Uh-huh.#

A.83:  because he didn't have a platform behind him, #uh, uh,#

B.84:  #Uh-huh.#

A.85:  you know, a group and [throat_clearing] I think that's --

B.86:  Right.

A.87:  -- a little bit disconcerting, you know, where --

B.88:  It is.

A.89:  -- uh, where we really Americans don't have a voice unless they participate
within o-, one of the two --

B.90:  Uh-huh.

A.91:  -- systems.

B.92:  And especially where, if you don't completely agree with their platform, if
there's, I mean, there's not a lot of choice, like you say, and you #have to,#

A.93:  #{Faint} Uh-huh.#

B.94:  have the financial support, or there's just no hope, and --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- um, I know that one of the,
