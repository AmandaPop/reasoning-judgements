=======================================================================

A.1:  Did you hear the topic?

B.2:  Something about a food, wasn't it?

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  What was, what was it exactly?

A.5:  Well, okay, I heard it a lot of times, I should know it by now.  Um, uh,
talk about food and cooking, and then it got into, um, what would, uh, oh,
what foods would you serve at a dinner party, and share a recipe if you have
one, or something --

B.6:  Share a recipe, huh.

A.7:  -- like that [laughter].

B.8:  I'll let you go first [laughter].

@A.9:  [Laughter] Oh, I'm not much of a cook, in fact, I'm standing here going
through a pile of stuff looking for my cookie cutters to do my Christmas
cooking.

B.10:  Oh.

A.11:  But, uh.  I don't give dinner parties.  The most extravagant I get is pizza
for twenty.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  But, uh, I don't know, but.

B.14:  Well, the thing I like at, at most dinner parties, I just li-, I like
vegetable trays.

A.15:  Oh, really.

B.16:  Yeah, just the, the, you know, dip with the, oh, broccoli and cauliflower
and you know, things like that.

A.17:  A healthy person.

B.18:  Well, 

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  I think that those are good, I like those, and then, uh, pretzels, and
things like that, but.

A.21:  Well, I like that.

B.22:  As far as fancy recipes go, though --

A.23:  [Laughter]  No.  Do you cook much?

B.24:  -- [Breathing] Uh, well, I'm in charge of the barbecue.

A.25:  Uh, right.

B.26:  That's pretty common.

A.27:  Uh-huh, it is.

B.28:  Once in a while I'll cook, uh, I'll cook Sunday dinner --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- and we'll have, uh, I, I have a very limited, uh, group of things I can
cook.

A.31:  [Laughter].

B.32:  I will cook a pot roast every once in a while, or, uh, oh, I've, I've
cooked the turkey before --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- at Thanksgiving, but, uh, I'm not much of a cook really.

A.35:  No, well, I'm not either.  I bought a precooked turkey for Thanksgiving.

B.36:  Oh, is that right.

A.37:  Yeah [laughter].

B.38:  Does that take long to, just have to heat it up, is that all?

A.39:  That's right.

B.40:  Oh.

A.41:  [Laughter] That was one of those smoked ones --

B.42:  Oh.

A.43:  -- that was pretty good.  

B.44:  I never tried those.

A.45:  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Uh, we got it, we got it real cheap, is why we
got it.

B.46:  Oh.

A.47:  And I'll probably do it next year, too.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  It saved an awful lot of work.

B.50:  Yeah, that, turkey's about a three or four hour project.  You have to keep
checking on it, and --

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  -- see if that little thing pops up, and.

A.53:  That's right.  See my mother can not (( )) anyway, so I figure --

B.54:  Oh.

A.55:  -- [Laughter] if it's not going to come out well, I may as well not waste
all my time on it, and --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- just get,

B.58:  Oh, what's worked well for us is put one of those, um, cooking bags, seems
to have helped things a little bit.

A.59:  Oh, really?

B.60:  Yeah, they slip, I guess you've seen them.  They're plastic.

A.61:  Yeah, I've never really tried one though.

B.62:  They don't, they don't seem to melt obviously, but, uh, [noise] they keep
it, uh, warm, moist and tender.

A.63:  Uh-huh.  Um.

B.64:  So.

@@A.65:  Well, I don't have much else to say on this topic.

B.66:  Well, this isn't my favorite, but, I'll, I'll be honest with you.

A.67:  I've gotten a, I've gotten some interesting ones in the past.  I was just
on a jury recently --

B.68:  Oh.

A.69:  -- and the two days after I got off the jury, one of my topics the first
day was what do you think of juries and, and the jury system?  The next day
was what do you think of capital punishment?

B.70:  Oh, is that right?

A.71:  So, it was pretty funny, because I had a lot to say [laughter] on that.

B.72:  Well, I work for a law firm, so I probably could have responded to that
one.

A.73:  Oh, really.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  Well, that's good.  Well listen, it was good talking to you.

B.76:  All righty.

A.77:  And I hope your wife's feeling better.

B.78:  Yeah, I, I think she will be.

A.79:  Well good.

B.80:  All right.

A.81:  All right.  Bye-bye.

B.82:  Bye, now.
