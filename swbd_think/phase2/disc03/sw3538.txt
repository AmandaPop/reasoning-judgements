========================================================================

A.1:  Well, um, I kind of like the Forty-Niners [laughter].

B.2:  San Francisco.

A.3:  Right.  

B.4:  #(( )).#

A.5:  #How# about you?

B.6:  I'm a, I'm a die hard Dallas fan.

A.7:  Oh, great.

B.8:  I was born and raised here, so, I, I have to back my team.

A.9:  Well, yes, I guess.  That's, that's understandable.  Um, 

B.10:  Why are you a Forty-Niners fan?

A.11:  [Laughter] Well, they have a couple of players, they have had and they do
now, that, that, um played here in Utah at B Y U before they went down there.
Um, Steve Young was from B Y U, and, uh, Jim McMahon was.  He's not, he's not
one of my favorite players, personality or otherwise, but [laughter] he did
play here, so that, you know, provides a little bit of interest.  Um, how
about you, what are, who are some of your favorite players?

B.12:  Well, there's a lot of them.  There's, uh, Michael Irwin.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  That's, uh, making a real, real good name for himself this year.

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  Troy Aikman.

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  I don't know if you ever heard of him.

A.19:  No, I haven't.

B.20:  ((Well)), do you watch football?

A.21:  Well, not too much.

B.22:  Not too much #[laughter].#

A.23:  #I,# I follow mostly, you know, the college.

B.24:  #Oh, really?#

A.25:  #The college# ones around here, rather than the, the professional.

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  So, you know, you'll [laughter] well, who do you think is going to go far
this year?

B.28:  I don't know.  It's, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty tough.  I'm, I'm, I
don't follow the other divisions,

A.29:  #Uh-huh.#

B.30:  #that,# that much.  It's, I have a hard enough time just keeping up with
Dallas,

A.31:  #Right.#

B.32:  #and# [breathing] the, uh, conference they're in right now.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  But I think Dallas will do pretty good.  #I don't,#

A.35:  #Oh, good.#

B.36:  I don't know if they'll go all the way.

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  [Breathing] They're probably, they may be another year away from going
all the way.

A.39:  Oh.

B.40:  But they'll, they'll be in the playoffs, and I think they'll do real good.

A.41:  Well, good.  What do you think about how much the football players make,
#professional# --

B.42:  #((That's))# --

A.43:  -- football players?

B.44:  -- uh, that's, I wouldn't mind,

A.45:  #[Laughter].#

B.46:  #wouldn't mind getting# some of their salaries.

A.47:  All right.  Do you, do you think they, they should be paid that much?

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Do you?

B.50:  I think they earn it.  I think they earn it.  I mean I, I mean I, you'd
have to pay me that much to get out there on the field to, uh, you know --

A.51:  #Uh-huh.#

B.52:  -- #get# the crap knocked out of me, so,

A.53:  Yeah.  Well, what about, um, yeah, I guess the risk of injury that they go
through.  I mean, they get injured, it's pretty much for life in that, that
kind of a thing.  Do you play football?  Do you,

B.54:  I did.  I, I just, I just coach, coach my son right now, so,

A.55:  Oh, that's what I, do you let your sons play?

B.56:  Yeah, #I do.  I mean# --

A.57:  #as dangerous as it is?#  

B.58:  -- I, I let them do whatever they want to do.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  I don't, I don't hold them back.  I mean, if they want to try it and, uh,
[breathing] do it, that's fine.  If they don't want to do it, that's fine.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  I mean, I, I leave them, leave it up to them.

A.63:  Oh, that's good.

B.64:  Because I don't want to hold them back from trying anything.  I mean, they
may #be,#

A.65:  #Uh-huh.#

B.66:  may be good at it.

A.67:  That's right, they might be.  They might be making one of those salaries
one of these days.

B.68:  That's right.

A.69:  [Laughter] Huh, okay.  Well, um, let's see, what else?  Do you have any
other teams that you follow at all besides Dallas or,

B.70:  No, not really.  Not really.

A.71:  That keeps, you #keeps you,#

B.72:  #Yeah,# that keeps me busy enough right there.  

A.73:  #Do you,# 

B.74:  #Do# you think San, how do you think San, how is San Francisco doing this
year?

A.75:  Well, oh, they're doing so-so.  They, they, uh, their main quarterback was
hurt, and so, um, Steve Young has been, uh, you know, in there taking his
place, but I think, I think the main one is getting better, so he, you know,
they can get back in the,

B.76:  Is Ma-, Mann the head quarterback, lead quarterback?

A.77:  Um.

B.78:  Isn't he playing for San Francisco?

A.79:  Yeah, he #is.#

B.80:  #Yeah.#

A.81:  I think he is.  Yeah, he #is.#

B.82:  #[Throat_clearing].#

A.83:  And then, um, Steve Young was, and he hurt his knee, McMahon hurt his knee,
and so the first couple of games, Steve Young went in for him.

B.84:  Yeah, I thought #I,#

A.85:  #But# I think he's back in there now.

B.86:  Yeah, I thought at first Steve Young started out as a lead quarterback --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- and then he got himself hurt, and McMahon came in in one of the games
and, uh, ended up just, uh, winning the game coming from behind.

A.89:  #(( )).#

B.90:  #And# they just let him keep starting because he was doing so good and kept
winning.

A.91:  Well, he, yeah, so he was better, because I think he was here at the first
of the season, and then yeah, that, that probably happened, so.  Do you watch
it Monday nights, is that you do on Monday nights, is watch the football
games?

B.92:  Uh, sometimes.

A.93:  #Sometimes.#

B.94:  #It dep-, yeah,# it all depends on what, what all is going on.

A.95:  And who,

B.96:  Someti-, sometimes I get a chance to, sometimes I don't.

A.97:  Uh-huh.  Oh, so, well, when you coached your son's team, did you enjoy
that?

B.98:  Yeah, enjoyed it a lot.  I #mean this,#

A.99:  #Well, that's great.#

B.100:  this is my first year as a coach.

A.101:  Uh-huh.

B.102:  His first year of playing, my first year as a coach, so it was #a,#

A.103:  #Oh.#

B.104:  it was a learning experience on both ends.

A.105:  Boy, I'll say, yeah.  How old, how old do they let them play?

B.106:  Uh, one that's, he's just getting ready to turn ten.

A.107:  Oh.

B.108:  Another one is getting ready to turn six, and one that's three so,

A.109:  Oh.  Are they all boys?

B.110:  All boys.

A.111:  Oh, yeah.  You'll probably have a few years of football #ahead of you.#

B.112:  #Yeah,# I think so #[laughter].#

@@A.113:  #[Laughter]# Okay, well, is there any other comment you wanted to make
or,

B.114:  Not that I can think of.

A.115:  Okay, all right.  Well, thank you.

B.116:  Thanks.   I enjoyed talking with you.

A.117:  Uh-huh.  Bye.
