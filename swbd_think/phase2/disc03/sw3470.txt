A.1:  Okay, what kind of car would you, uh, [laughter] would you buy if you're
going to by one these days?

@B.2:  Uh, that, uh, to be real honest, I'm thinking about a truck as opposed to
a car.

A.3:  What kind of truck?  

B.4:  Uh, probably some sort of utility type vehicle, either a, uh, my particular
favorite right at the moment is that Explorer, the Ford, uh, Explorer.

A.5:  Oh, I, I think that's pretty good.  I, uh, I got to look for something,
too.  I, I, unfortunately I have a Ford Thunderbird that, uh, has been in the
shop for three days and they can't fix the thing, so I'm not real happy with
Ford at the moment.

B.6:  Oh. 

A.7:  I, I think I will try some other [laughter] line.  

B.8:  Some other brand [laughter] or something, yeah.  No, I just am, I have
looked for a long time.  I've, I've had, since I've been out of school, I've
mostly had, uh, you know, German cars like, uh, I had, I mean, you know, used
ones obviously [laughter].  Uh, I had a Mercedes sedan and then I had a B M
W.

A.9:  How, how did those work?  How long did they last you?  

B.10:  They're excellent cars and if you, my, uh, I was a little partial to the
Mercedes.  I think, I almost wish I'd kept it.  It was old.  It was, by the
time I sold it, it was about f-, thirteen or fifteen years old.

A.11:  How many miles you get on that?  

B.12:  Oh, jeez, I, uh, [laughter] I don't,   

A.13:  Did you get a couple hundred thousand?  

B.14:  At least.  

A.15:  Really?  

B.16:  I mean the, the year model that I had was one that, that, uh, they say that
those engines are built to be completely torn down and rebuilt like at least
three times.

A.17:  Um.  

B.18:  That's the amount of metal that they have in them. 

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  That Mercedes really, I mean they look at the car is they built, you know,
they build this car, you buy this car, you can drive this car your whole life.

A.21:  Maybe that's the kind of car I better buy.  I drive too many miles.  I, uh,
I drive about thirty-five thousand miles a year and, uh, American cars, I
guess just don't do that kind of mileage.

B.22:  I think they don't build them to hold up to that for some reason.

A.23:  Well, well I think the cars do.  I don't think they have mechanics that can
fix them.  That's the whole problem.

B.24:  Yeah, that's probably, and all this computerized stuff is just --

A.25:  Yep.

B.26:  -- fine and good, but, you know, something goes wrong and, and, it seems
like, you know, it's like, 

A.27:  Well, they can't fix them.  They don't, they don't have the, 

B.28:  Yeah, you can't fix anything anymore.  You have to replace entire parts --

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  -- or something.  You know, you can't, you know, back in the olden days
[laughter], 

A.31:  [Laughter]  Where, where do you live?  What city do you live in?

B.32:  I live in Dallas.  

A.33:  You live in Dallas.  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  Well, you got the same problem with mechanics I think.  Me, I, I just don't
think there's good mechanics around.

B.36:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I just, I, I do a lot of stuff myself because
it seems like if you take something to a dealership, you know, they are even
more inclined to not fix something and just, like, replace the entire part.

A.37:  I think you're right.  

B.38:  And, and, and they don't seem to really know how to do anything else, you
know, what I call parts changers.  And, and so, I get myself a little book and
I start fixing a lot of stuff myself.

A.39:  Want to fix my Thunderbird?  

B.40:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.41:  [Laughter]  They can't fix it.  

B.42:  If it's a very new one, I wouldn't even begin to, you know,   

A.43:  [Laughter]. 

B.44:  All this computer stuff just loses me.  I don't like to look under the
engine of a car and not see anything I recognize, you know.

A.45:  That's the problem.  I agree with you.  Used to be you could, you could
repair and do all those things yourself.  And there's --

B.46:  Oh, yeah.  

A.47:  -- there's so much p-, I, I think that the antipollution stuff is what
really fouls up a lot of engines and, uh, 

B.48:  Yeah.  I, I think because -- 

A.49:  There's no way you can work on them. 

B.50:  -- the whole system wasn't designed with that in mind in the first place so
they just came up with something they could slap on after the fact.

A.51:  Yep, that's right.  

B.52:  You know, I mean, if, if, if you really wanted to, I mean, you know, if we
can send people to the moon, 

A.53:  [Laughter] [noise]. 

B.54:  we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly
efficient engine --

A.55:  I think they can, it's just that,  

B.56:  -- that would also be good for the environment.  But th-, you know, there's
no percentages in doing that.  There's too much, I mean they can make too much
money doing the, [laughter] doing the other way around, or something.

A.57:  That's why, the electric has been made for some time, but, uh, there's too
much politics and too much gas and oil people that will prevent that from
coming on the market for the time being, I'm afraid.

B.58:  I'll tell you.  You know, the thing I'm worried about is, that's strictly
short term.  I mean, that, you know, we know that our oil supply is running
out, you know, and what happens when it does is what I want to [laughter]
know.

A.59:  Then they bring it on board.  

B.60:  I mean, I may not have to worry about it, 

A.61:  [Cough].

B.62:  about it happen in my lifetime, but I worry about it anyway because I
know it's out there.

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  I don't know, it's just,  

A.65:  Well, we can always go back to horses.  

B.66:  Well, that's,  

A.67:  [Laughter]. 

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  Least you don't have to worry about maintaining them.  

B.70:  This, well, this is true.  You can just like have them out there, I don't
know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either.

A.71:  [Laughter]. 

B.72:  I don't know, I don't know that I'd want to have to rely on that as my
transportation, but, I don't know, I just, you know, I've been looking at, at
some things and, like I say, I've been looking at these Explorers and these
other, kind of, you know, Blazers and whatnot and, you know, they open up the
hood and they say, you know, 

A.73:  You think they last a long time?  

B.74:  I don't know, they, but they say, they open up the hood, they show you all
these modern advances they made and they show,
