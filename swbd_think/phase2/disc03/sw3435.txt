============================================================================

A.1:  ((Push)) my number.  Okay.  

@B.2:  Okay.  So are you a, a, a golfer or are you a spectator?  

A.3:  Oh, I'm a, I play golf but I don't actually play golf.  

B.4:  Well, I'm the same way.  I, 

A.5:  #Yeah.#

B.6:  #I go out there# and hit the ball.  

A.7:  Hack it all over the place?  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  It's sickening, isn't it?  

B.10:  Um, uh, well, in the Carolina's it's, it's just, you know, we've got a
bunch of golf courses around here.

A.11:  Yeah.  We've got tons up here but I don't know.  How do you feel about your
game?  I guess that's a good question?

B.12:  Uh, well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all, uh, uh, a friend of mine
goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and I, uh, I don't
have a, I don't really even have a game.  I usually when I go out and play
golf it's usually like at a, at one of these par threes that,

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  you know, you, but, um, I like watching it on T V.  

A.15:  Yeah, I like that too.

B.16:  #Uh,# 

A.17:  #I# don't know I try to play, but God, I, a couple years ago I played two,
three times a week and got lousy.  I guess that's the best I ever got was
lousy.  And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to
come and then I got worse again so.

B.18:  Well, I, I, I, if I can, I can hit a great deal like, um, they, they, my
friends ((to get me)) they, they say I hit worm burners because I, I can't hit
it up in the air.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  So I'm pretty bad but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, you know, 
(( )) across the ground, and if it's going over water or something one of them
have to take the shot for me because I'm, but I'm getting better.  I've got
where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time.

A.21:  That's pretty good.  

B.22:  Yeah.  Uh, so I'm kind of a novice at it.  

A.23:  Um, I'm that and worse.  I, I play next year I, actually I take it kind of
seriously but I've been doing so bad.  Next year, I always say this every
year, but next year I'm starting over from scratch.  I'm going to go take
lessons and everything.  I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually
play this game or not.

B.24:  Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of
lessons or something.  Because I, my, my tee off is not bad, I mean I'm, I'm
good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just, that, that
initial tee [laughter].

A.25:  Yeah, what do you do when you're putting?  That's a good thing.  That's
something I could learn actually.  That's when I do my worst.  I finally get
to the green and I think I'm doing all, all fine and then, 

B.26:  Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really, you
know, checking the ground and, and so forth, you know.

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  See how it's going to break or whatever.  

A.29:  Can you really see it though?  

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  #What about the speed?#

B.32:  #If you get,# if you get down on the ground you really can.

A.33:  Can you tell ho-, no-, but can you tell how, how fast you're going to hit
it?

B.34:  Um, well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not
kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's,
it's, you know, because when it's going up a hill it's going to break #in a
direction.#

A.35:  #Yeah, but# you can feel that?  

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  I don't know I have, I can gi-, get it within like, you know, four or five
feet or something but I don't have enough field.  Now I'm T V watching.

B.38:  #Yeah.# 

A.39:  #They# make you die at the hole every time.  

B.40:  #Yeah.# 

A.41:  #Oh, it# just dies and rolls in.  I don't know, 

B.42:  #But I,# 

A.43:  #it's hard for me.# 

B.44:  The, the, it's, it's like I said once I get up on the green I'm fine, but
that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know, when teeing off i-, I'll go probably a
hundred feet across the ground so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole
but, 

A.45:  Once you're there, you're all set though.  

B.46:  I'm all set.  

A.47:  We should play team golf then.   

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  I'll get us there and you put it in.  

B.50:  [Laughter] (( )) that sounds good to me.  

A.51:  I s-, oh, the T V golfers they do that.  It takes them two to get there and
two to get it in so it's fifty percent.  And me it takes me five to get there
and five to get it in.

B.52:  Well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three to get
it there and, and then, that's according to the hole and it ju-, uh, uh, maybe
one or two putts.  It's,

A.53:  #Yeah.#  

B.54:  #according to# where I'm at on the green.  

A.55:  That's good.  

B.56:  But the friends I play with, uh, they play all the time and, and they're
really good.

A.57:  Joe Pros?  

B.58:  Uh, they're not Joe Pros but they, they golf in the high sixties low
seventies so I guess they're pretty good [laughter].

A.59:  That's pretty good.  For eighteen?  

B.60:  Yeah.  For eighteen.  

A.61:  Wow, that's pretty good.  

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  I'm talking to the wrong guy.  Your shitty golf is probably the best golf
I've ever seen.

B.64:  No, no, no, that's not my golf.  That's my friends.  Mine, mine, I'm, I'm
usually in the eighties or nineties so I'm, I'm not good [laughter].

A.65:  If, when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good.  I'm usually around a
hundred.  That's my thing.  Around a hundred.  You know, I can hit a great
drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole but it ain't going
to happen.

B.66:  Well, I either, teeing off I either slice it or I hook it ever single time
and, and I alternate.

A.67:  Well, it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time.  That's good.
I aim,
