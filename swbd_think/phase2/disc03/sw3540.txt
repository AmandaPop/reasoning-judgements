=========================================================================

A.1:  Well, I need to find out from you how the last remodeling project you
undertook and if it was successful and you, you were pleased with what
happened.

@B.2:  #Well,#

A.3:  #Have# you been doing any remodeling lately?

B.4:  The only remodeling we do is we prepped out new, uh, we put up molding and
wallpaper.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And we put it up in Chad's room and in the, uh, front room.

A.7:  All right.

B.8:  #But I ((let the)),# 

A.9:  #Did you# like the results?

B.10:  Yeah.  I don't do the actual, uh, uh, putting it, I don't actually cut the,
the molding.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  I mean, we have a guy come in and do that.  We do the painting and the
[breathing] sanding and [breathing] then I built some shelves in the basement
last week, so --

A.13:  All right.

B.14:  -- I, I guess that qualifies.

A.15:  [Laughter]  Yes, it does.  What kind of molding?  Is this, uh, molding,

B.16:  Crown molding.

A.17:  #Oh.#

B.18:  #And# then some, uh, chair molding.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  But, uh,

A.21:  Well, that's a lot of fun.  We,

B.22:  I guess we will have to do some new projects when the baby comes.

A.23:  Oh, yes, decorate a nursery or something, huh?

B.24:  Yeah.  Well, you know, we got the T V in this room, that's probably have to
be converted to a bedroom.

A.25:  Oh, #okay.#

B.26:  #So.#

A.27:  Yes, get some, uh, get an extra room there for the new #baby.#

B.28:  #Well,# you, you haven't had to do any of that, have you?

A.29:  What's that?

B.30:  Any remodeling, really.

A.31:  No, uh, we've done, uh, some painting and put up some wallpaper in, uh --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- in the boys' room.  We needed to, to paint because the paint was, uh,
getting mol-, dingy or, or grain, plus there was a lot of markings on the, on
the paint that [breathing] well, on top of the bunk beds, the boys got up
there, and, uh, started drawing on the ceiling, and that was kind of hard to
get off, so we decided rather than, uh, uh, wash it all off and clean it up,
we decided to paint over it and --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- the walls were, were textured and there was a lot of holes from the
previous owners, and so we patched them all up and painted and, and put border
and wallpaper along the top, and it looks really nice now.  And we, we're
quite pleased with it and,

B.36:  #Uh-huh.#

A.37:  #and,# uh, it, uh, it looks pretty good.  There's a lot of other things
that Cheryl would like me to do but,

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  #[Laughter].#

B.40:  #Yeah.#  #I guess we'll eventually# --

A.41:  #It's just finding the time.#

B.42:  -- get around to finishing the basement someday, I don't know when.

A.43:  Well, good, good.

B.44:  I think I #might# --

A.45:  #Uh.#

B.46:  -- uh, paint the, uh, cement.  You can, there's supposedly kind of a cement
paint you can get that, uh, [breathing] will make it just a little nicer even,
you know, before we finish it.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  Well, good.  You, uh, you put on a dick, deck there recently too,
haven't you, or has that been a couple of years?

B.48:  Well, parts of the cement, cement had a patio.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  I painted the, uh, the porch.  That was kind of a job.

A.51:  Yes [laughter].  I #imagine# --

B.52:  #Had# --

A.53:  -- it would be.

B.54:  -- eighty-eight spindles to sand.

A.55:  Wow.

B.56:  Take all the paint off, and we borrowed an air gun from Laura's
brother-in-law and it, uh,

A.57:  You painted it wet? 

B.58:  [Child_talking] Yeah, and that worked nice.  

A.59:  Well, good.

B.60:  It's just one of those Wagner ones, you know, they,

A.61:  Yeah, we have one.

B.62:  They work pretty well, #really.  They're# --

A.63:  #Yes.  I,#

B.64:  -- noisy.

A.65:  Yeah, they are.  They, they make a lot of noise, but they're good.

B.66:  #Uh-huh.#

A.67:  #We# haven't used ours yet.  We'd like to use ours.

B.68:  You haven't used it at all?  [Child_talking].

A.69:  No, I haven't.

B.70:  Oh, so you don't [breathing] you don't know how, uh, wait, the only thing
you've got to worry about is getting the paint the right viscosity.

A.71:  Yeah, so it doesn't #jam up#.

B.72:  #You've# used one before, though, it sounds like.

A.73:  Yes, I have.

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  It was my dad's and I, I used it with him #and# --

B.76:  #Uh-huh.#

A.77:  -- was able to paint some things, and, uh, and he said he didn't need it
anymore and he, he gave it to us, and we haven't #had# --

B.78:  #Oh.#

A.79:  -- a chance to, or need to paint anything down here yet.

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  I, I'm kind of leery about using it inside, um, because it does put a lot
of particles and mist in the air --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- that I didn't want to get all over the carpet or,

B.84:  [Child_talking] [lipsmack] Yeah, it puts out a lot.

A.85:  Yes #[laughter].#

B.86:  #And# I mean, I even (( )) that when we did that porch.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  I mean, there was [laughter] I had the, I had my watch, and it was all over
my shoes, and the #shrubs,# 

A.89:  #[Laughter].#

B.90:  all turned white #down there.#

A.91:  #[Laughter]#  It, it snowed, huh?

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  That's about the only snow we can get down here in Texas, if it, if it were
a white paint.  You probably used a, a, uh, redwood color or a stain, didn't
you?

B.94:  It was just, it was white.

A.95:  Oh, it was?

B.96:  Yeah, because the porch, the porch spindles are #white.#

A.97:  #Yeah,# that's right, that's right.

B.98:  And, uh, #it# --

A.99:  #Oh.#

B.100:  -- was a latex.  We had a, had a hard time getting it thin enough,

A.101:  #Yeah.#

B.102:  #because# latex is kind of rubbery to begin with.

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  A little thicker than most.  But it ended up working fine.

A.105:  Oh, good.

B.106:  [Breathing] Plus the, the weather, you know, I did it in, uh, well, the
winter (( )) to, to cool down.  I think it must have been October when I
finished.

A.107:  Uh-huh.

B.108:  Or, yeah, I remember, it was a conference weekend, I think, when I
finished.

A.109:  Well, the, the weather, I understand was pretty good at that time.

B.110:  Yeah #[breathing] it# --

A.111:  #Yeah, the weather# --

B.112:  -- it was not bad but,

A.113:  -- the weather is beautiful down here.

B.114:  Is it?

A.115:  Real nice, real nice.  It got up to about seventy-five degrees down here,
and that's kind of the right temperature to be painting things but,

B.116:  Yeah.

A.117:  Yeah, it's, uh, we would like to, like to do a little bit more.  #We'll# --

B.118:  #Uh-huh.#

A.119:  -- probably do some.  We were working recently out on our spa #and# --

B.120:  #Yeah.#

A.121:  -- uh, and hot tub trying to, it was really overgrown with a lot,
