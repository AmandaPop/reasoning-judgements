A.1:  Hi, my name is Donna, and I'm calling, calling from Plano, Texas.

@B.2:  I'm Jay in Dallas.

A.3:  Oh, okay, um, I, um, find exercise kind of a task, I guess I'd say.  I go
to aerobics [child_yelling] two days a week, but I also have [child_yelling]
three kids at home so they keep me pretty busy.

B.4:  That keeps you plenty of exercise (( )).

A.5:  Yeah, that gives me plenty of exercise, but I enjoy, um, [child_yelling]
walking outside and [child_yelling] bicycling once in a while with the family.
Excuse me [noise] {muffled sound as if hand over the phone}.  That's fine.
And yourself.

B.6:  Well, I, uh, I have, I walked and run ev-, um, almost every morning.  I've
sort of stopped here with the weather change, but, uh, it's about a thirty
minute exercise every morning.

A.7:  Uh-huh, every morning.  Well, my husband swims every day at lunch, which he
loves doing --

B.8:  Oh, that would, that's fantastic exercise.

A.9:  -- yeah, he does it every day like a ritual.  Once in a while or if he has
a business meeting or if he, um, someone invites him to lunch, he'll, he'll
not go, but he goes, um, every, every day, and then he ru-, he's a runner,
too.  He runs three mornings a week he gets up about five and, and --

B.10:  Um.

A.11:  -- does his, his deal, and some days he doesn't, but then maybe he'll catch
up on the weekend and go for a run.

B.12:  All right.

A.13:  And, um, we (( )).

B.14:  I'd rather get a bicycle, but I have an ex-, I had an exercise bike in the
house, but didn't seem to use it enough, so somebody sold it in a garage sale,
and so, uh --

A.15:  Oh.

B.16:  -- but I'd like to get a bike and just do, uh, do biking outside.

A.17:  The, the, the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here,
and I know, um, uh, we, we both of, my husband and I both do it to just
[child_yelling] keep the pounds off.  We're getting up in age, I guess, in our
late thirties so we need to --

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  -- keep exercising just to be able to, uh.

B.20:  It keeps going, because I'm fifty-five, and it, uh, it just gets worse.
You still want to eat, and, uh --

A.21:  Oh, I know.

B.22:  -- but you just, I think you feel better, too, if you get on some program
like that, but, uh.

A.23:  Yeah, I go to this aerobics class two mornings a week, and I take my three
year old with me.  There's a nursery there.  And it's kind of another day out
for her --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- to, um, have little friends, and, um, I, I enjoy the socialization of
it, you know, getting to see the same women every --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- morning, but um, there are some parts during that exercise that I think,
I cannot do [laughter] another --

B.28:  Oh.

A.29:  -- second of this.

B.30:  I know it, it, it, some of it is so tough --

A.31:  It is.

B.32:  -- and, uh, especially when somebody's, uh, planning lunch for you and they
know what, what's good for you, I think when we do it ourselves, we take the
easy way sometimes.

A.33:  That's true, that's true.

B.34:  So.

A.35:  Well.

B.36:  So anyway --

A.37:  Okay, well.

B.38:  -- thank you for calling.

A.39:  Yes, thank you for participating.

B.40:  All right.

A.41:  Thank you.  Bye.

B.42:  Bye-bye.
