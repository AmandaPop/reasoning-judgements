===========================================================================

A.1:   Uh, we have two pets at the moment.  We have a cat -- 

B.2:   Oh. 

A.3:   -- and we also have a bird.  That's a strange combination
[laughter].  

B.4:   [Laughter]. 

A.5:   I guess that the cat is an, an outdoor cat.  And, uh, we've
had him for four years.  It's really a good cat.  When we first
talked about getting one, my husband isn't really fond of cats, 
and -- 

B.6:   Uh-huh.  

A.7:   -- and we went ahead and got this one for my little girl from
her great grandma -- 

B.8:   Oh. 

A.9:   -- and it's turned out to be a very good pet.  She, or, he is,
uh, you know, he stays outside, he doesn't try and come in the
house and trip you up and he just, he's almost like a dog.  Our
cars will,  

B.10:   [Laughter]. 

A.11:   come down the road and, and the cat will come running out
from the fields.  We live in quite a rural little community and,
and he comes running.  He can hear our car [laughter].  

B.12:   Oh. 

A.13:   So he is more, you know, like a dog.  It's really a good
animal.  

B.14:   Does your cat try to run away at all?  

A.15:   No, we haven't had a bit of problem with that.  The only, uh,
incident we had about like that was when he was just a kitten, 
uh -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   -- on Halloween we lost track of him and I don't know -- 

B.18:   Oh. 

A.19:   -- whether he followed some trick or treaters or,  

B.20:   [Laughter]. 

A.21:   you know, they scared him or what, but he, uh, was gone and
we thought for sure he was gone and he was gone three weeks and
then he,   

B.22:   Three weeks.  

A.23:   [Laughter]  Yes, and then he came back and he had a crooked
paw, so apparently -- 

B.24:   Oh. 

A.25:   -- he had, [lipsmack] yeah, apparently he had broken his foot
somehow, but he did come back so,

B.26:   Well, that's great.  

A.27:   Yes, yes, and how about you?  

B.28:   We have a dog.  

A.29:   Oh. 

B.30:   We have a three year old dog about -- 

A.31:   Oh.  

B.32:   -- medium size.  

A.33:   Uh-huh.  

B.34:   And she's, uh, an indoor dog.  

A.35:   Oh, fun.  

B.36:   And she is, yeah, she's like our baby.  

A.37:   Oh, now is it, is that, that's not still considered a puppy. 

B.38:   Not technically [laughter].  

A.39:   [Laughter].

B.40:   We consider her a puppy.  

A.41:   Do you?  

B.42:   I, she still acts like a puppy, but,  

A.43:   Oh, real active --

B.44:   Yeah.

A.45:   -- and,  

B.46:   Oh, very.  

A.47:   Oh, what,  

B.48:   Too active.  

A.49:   Oh, [laughter] what's her name?  

B.50:   Sam, Samantha.  

A.51:   Oh, oh, that's, that's a nice name.  We, uh, our cat is named,
we named it Duchess and then we found out it was a boy.  

B.52:   Oh [laughter].  

A.53:   [Laughter]  But it was too late to change, so,  

B.54:   Oh, that's neat.  

A.55:   Now is, is that the only pet you have?  

B.56:   Yes.  

A.57:   Oh, what kind of a dog is it?  

B.58:   She's a mix between a German Shepherd and a Husky.  

A.59:   Oh, pretty.  

B.60:   Yeah, she is really pretty, and she's a good watchdog.  We
live -- 

A.61:   Oh. 

B.62:   -- in a one bedroom apartment --

A.63:   Uh-huh.

B.64:   -- and she will growl and bark at strangers walking by or if
she hears any -- 

A.65:   Oh. 

B.66:   -- footsteps.  

A.67:   Oh, that's good.  

B.68:   Yes, it is good.  

A.69:   [Noise]  Boy.  

B.70:   It's nice to have [laughter].  

A.71:   And your apartment, apparently, a-, they allow pets.  

B.72:   Yes.  

A.73:   [Laughter]. 

B.74:   It was hard to find, uh -- 

A.75:   Uh-huh.  

B.76:   -- apartment out here.  We live in, uh, Penn State University.

A.77:   Oh. 

B.78:   And it's hard to find apartments that take pets, so we're way
on the outskirts of town.  

A.79:   Oh. 

B.80:   Because, and we have a ground floor apartment with -- 

A.81:   Uh-huh.  

B.82:   -- like a private yard and we can just open up the door and we
play frisbee and ball and,   

A.83:   How nice.  

B.84:   So she gets some exercise.  We go for walks.  

A.85:   Oh, boy, that sounds ideal.  Because, yeah, they do need,
especially dogs, they need to -- 

B.86:   Uh-huh.  

A.87:   -- run and jump and, oh, well, that's great.  

B.88:   That's true.

A.89:   I, we had a, uh, a little bird, we've only had it for about
six months and we got that for my son for his birthday and it's
named Buttercup, a little yellow -- 

B.90:   Oh. 

A.91:   -- yellow parakeet [laughter].  

B.92:   [Laughter]  That's a good bird name [laughter].  

A.93:   Yes [laughter].  They chose that and I, one other pet we had
an experience with over the summer, it's a kind of a funny thing
we, my neighbor had given her children each of, a, a bunny rabbit
for Easter.  

B.94:   Oh, wow.  

A.95:   Yes, and, and then here kids had them for a couple of months
and they, you know, kind of tired of them like kids do and, and she
said, do you want these and so we said, yes, we'll take them and,
and take care of them for a while.  And she said, now, you know,
when you don't want them a know a man that just loves them and
he'll take them anytime you want and -- 

B.96:   Oh. 

A.97:   -- we were a little bit reluctant with the cat and the bird
already to take on some more [laughter].  But so we took these
three rabbits from them and about two weeks later, uh, my son went
out to feed them and, and he said, mom, I think the white bunny is
sick.  

B.98:   Oh, no.  

A.99:   And so, yeah, we went out immediately and lifted up the hutch
lid and the momma rabbit, the white one had had eleven babies
[laughter].  

B.100:   How many?  

A.101:   Yeah, eleven.  

B.102:   Oh, my goodness.  

A.103:   So that was quite a surprise and,  

B.104:   [Laughter]. 

A.105:   so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two
weeks [laughter].  

B.106:   Oh, my gosh. 

A.107:   But, I guess that was her first time being a mother.  And I,
I'm not real knowledgeable about bunnies, but they all died and
I,  

B.108:   Oh, they all did?  

A.109:   They all did and she, well, she didn't take care of them and
I've heard sometimes that with their first, their first, you know,
litter that they do that but,

B.110:   Oh, that's sad.  

A.111:   Yeah, it was.  It was really, a really hard ex-,
