========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what do you think is one of the major problems with air pollution in
Houston?

@B.2:  Uh, well, without a doubt, uh, [throat_clearing] one of the biggest
problems with, are automobiles.  I mean, we've got, you know, uh, I think,
probably we'd only be second to, uh, uh, Los Angeles really as far as a, a, a
major metropolitan area that's completely dependent upon automobiles.  There
is just no real mass transit here and I think it's a, a major drawback for
Houston.  A, a close runner up to that would be all of the, uh, uh,
petrochemical and, uh, oil industry plants that we have here.  Uh,

A.3:  I can't speak too much for Iowa.  I just moved here from Utah where I just
graduated but, uh, I know there cars were also, uh, the major problem and the
problem there in the mountainous region where we were surrounded by mountains,
uh, is we had these temperature inversions, so in the, uh, winter, all the
pollution was trapped in.

B.4:  Right.  

A.5:  And so we had major pollution problems there particularly, well, not only
from cars, but we had things like T M tin from a local steel mill, I mean
that's continued running during, you know, whether or not we had the
temperature inversions or not.

B.6:  Yeah.  

A.7:  So, uh, that was another big source.  And plus the university where I went
also used coal for, uh, all their heating purposes.

B.8:  You're kidding [laughter].  

A.9:  So,  

B.10:  That's, that's amazing that they still use coal.  

A.11:  So, uh, so, but [breathing], they're in the process of converting over,
but, uh, at that time they, uh, were still using just coal for --

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  -- for their, for their heating.  

B.14:  What part of Iowa do you live in now?  

A.15:  Uh, [lipsmack] uh, Iowa City, Iowa.  

B.16:  I've been through there.  

A.17:  I'm working at the university here.  

B.18:  Yeah, I've been through there before.  

A.19:  Oh. 

B.20:  Yeah.  Is that, 

A.21:  Well, I was just in Houston also, uh, [breathing] uh, about a month ago
with, uh, the, a conference for the Acoustical Society of America.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  So, uh, and I enjoyed Houston [laughter].  

B.24:  Yeah, now, I've, I've lived in, this is the second time I've lived in
Houston.  It's, I've been, I brought back here before, uh, the second, just,
uh, about a year and a half ago, I was transferred back to Houston after being
away for about six years.  And it's not, I can't really say this it's any
worse than it was.  As a matter of fact, I think if anything, a-, the, the air
situation here might be a little bit better and I, I think part of that has to
do with, uh, the older cars are being phased off the road and the more modern,
uh, models, I think, are, you know, pollute so much less.  Uh, you know, with
the unleaded gasoline and fuel injection and, uh, the, uh, uh, uh, you know,
the computer chips that monitor the way the engine runs, I think we've got
much cleaner burning automobiles now than certainly we had ten, fifteen or
twenty years ago.  But, at the same time, uh, there is just only so much that,
you know, you can take.  And it's, I think eventually we're going to have to
bite the bullet and invest in some sort of really good mass transit system
whether it's rail, monorail, or, or what, but, uh, w-, uh, the, the leaders
and, and the people, too, people just are not ready to give up their cars and
I don't think that they're going to do that until it just becomes, uh,
economically necessary for them to.

A.25:  Yeah.  I know, even in the small town, university town, the university is
congested into the little downtown that we have, but there is no place for
anyone to park and, even as staff in the university, I cannot get parking, so
I'm forced to, uh, take the bus, although buses pollute enough themselves,
too.

B.26:  Yeah, really.  

A.27:  But,  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  But, uh, I know, I, I cannot, in Utah, no one took the bus, but here in,
[laughter] in Iowa people are forced to take the bus to get to the university,
which I think is little bit interesting.  I mean, it's a small university
town, but everything is just in this one area in downtown so, and there is no
parking so, 

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  Anyway, we're forced to, uh,  

B.32:  Well, and, again, I think that is indicative of the general, uh, state of,
of things, uh, here in the U S. I think that unless, uh, again, you are just
forced to, either by economy or just, like, you know, a situation like you
say, where there is no parking available.  Uh, I th-, I think that is really
one of the few, most people, I don't think, the, there are a few die hard
people that will a-, always commute, uh, and I, I applaud them.  I think that
is great, but, uh, I for one, I'm just as guilty as the next person.  I want
the convenience of going out there, cranking up my car and driving to exactly
where I want to go a-, at exactly the time I want to go and not have to be
dependent upon any schedule.  So, but, uh, anyway, it's, at least it's not
Mexico City [laughter].

A.33:  Yeah, uh, I, w-, one thing I thought, though,
