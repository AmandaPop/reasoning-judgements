A.1:   Okay, Jerry, I guess tonight's topic is about recycling.  

@B.2:   Uh-huh.  

A.3:   And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our
community -- 

B.4:   All right.  

A.5:   -- here in Plano.  Right now we have a pretty nice recycling
program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by
the, by the collection agency or the, the city along with your
garbage can.  Uh, you can put out newspaper, you can put out glass,
you can put out aluminum cans, you can put, put out certain types
of plastic material and that is on a roll out effort right now. 
Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, uh,
participate right now, but, uh, that will be rolled out to
everyone, I hope, in the next year or so.  And those that aren't
participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can
take glass and newspaper and aluminum.  And I think, uh, overall
that's an, an excellent opportunity because I hate to see our
landfills being filled up and, uh, growing bigger and bigger and
bigger where they are becoming a big problem for o-, not only the
people that are living today, but for the future also.  So,  

B.6:   Yeah, uh, I was read-,  

A.7:   How about your community?  

B.8:   [Laughter] My community, that's cute.  

A.9:   [Laughter]. 

B.10:   I live in a place called Dye Mound.  

A.11:   Dye Mound?  

B.12:   Or Dye Community.  

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   And it's not a city, [lipsmack] not incorporated, my nearest
neighbor's about a half a mile at least,  

A.15:   [Laughter]. 

B.16:   I can't even see their house and, uh,  

A.17:   Sounds like a place where I grew up [laughter].  

B.18:   Yeah, I mean, uh, I'm out in, I'm out in the wilderness.  
#Literally.#

A.19:  #Well, I like it.#  

B.20:   And, uh, well, give you an idea, it's three and a half miles
of dirt road to the concrete,  

A.21:   [Laughter].  

B.22:   I mean, to the asphalt, we're out there.  

A.23:   Uh-huh.  

B.24:   And, uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things.  

A.25:   Well, good.  

B.26:   I'm building our house right now and I'm going to incorporate
into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher.  

A.27:   Oh, okay.  

B.28:   So when I drive the car in the, in the driveway in the
afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually
puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic
cylinder.  

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   And the weight of the car will crush,  

A.31:   [Cough]. 

B.32:   what's ever in the disposer.  

A.33:   Oh. 

B.34:   Hope-, hopefully, it's not my wife.  

A.35:   [Laughter]. 

B.36:   [Laughter]. 

A.37:   Well, let's hope not.  You can be, uh, get in trouble for
that.  

B.38:   Well, I thought I'd, you know, I'd use it as a, an escapement
type thing.  I don't know if you're familiar with that operation,
but, what you do is you just build up the pressure -- 

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   -- and then you go over and release it and then it just, it
just drops, you know.  

A.41:   Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it?  

B.42:   Very similar, yeah.  

A.43:   Okay, okay.  

B.44:   Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the
jack, but you, it won't go down.  

A.45:   Yes, until you release it.  

B.46:   Until you pull the pin, yeah.  

A.47:   All right.  

B.48:   Anyway -- 

A.49:   I think,  

B.50:   -- I have another, uh, recycling method I use.  

A.51:   Yes.  

B.52:   You know all that junk mail you get?  

A.53:   Oh, [laughter] yes, I sure do.  

B.54:   The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that
and -- 

A.55:   Uh-huh.  

B.56:   -- you have won and all that.  Well, anytime they send me a
return envelope -- 

A.57:   Uh-huh.  

B.58:   -- I put all that stuff back in the envelope -- 

A.59:   Oh. 

B.60:   -- plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up. 

A.61:   [Laughter]. 

B.62:   Because, uh, well, like I say, we live a way and when you
throw trash away, you throw it in my yard.  

A.63:   Yes.  

B.64:   And I don't like that -- 

A.65:   No.  

B.66:   -- so I don't do that.  So I take it and I send, and I mail it
back to them.  

A.67:   Well, great.  That's excellent.  

B.68:   I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff.  

A.69:   [Laughter]  Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we
wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail.  That's a great idea.  I
hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some
of that.  One thing, 

B.70:   Yeah.  Well, I think one of the, the best ways to eliminate,
uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable
items.  

A.71:   Right.  

B.72:   For instance, uh, I saw a thing on, uh, NOVA, I think it was
the other day.  

A.73:   Uh-huh.  

B.74:   This guy has designed recyclable materials, I mean recyclable
items.  

A.75:   Right.  

B.76:   Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing.  

A.77:   Oh. 

B.78:   See, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic.  

A.79:   Yes.  

B.80:   If it's metal, it's all out of metal.  It's, he's a design,
he's a engineer, designing stuff.  

A.81:   Well, that's a great idea, that's a great idea.  

B.82:   And, and, in-, incorporating, you know, reusable materials
into your, uh, you know, your -- 

A.83:   Products.  

B.84:   -- assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations
is -- 

A.85:   Yes.  

B.86:   -- is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale. 
Make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle -- 

A.87:   Uh-huh.  

B.88:   -- and somebody will find a way to make money at it.  

A.89:   Yes, they will.  

B.90:   And,  

A.91:   Exactly.  

B.92:   Well, there is a guy in Dallas, that's all he does.  

A.93:   Huh.  

B.94:   He collects trash.  You know, and,  

A.95:   [Laughter]  Well, that's a full time job.   

B.96:   Yeah, well,  he's, he's out for cardboard.  

A.97:   Yes, well, I've found out, too, that, uh, you know, a couple
years ago, we've always been recycling [noise] newspaper for the
last twelve years, and at one time we could get a pretty good
return, uh, with the Boy Scouts.  We could take and collect the
newspaper,
