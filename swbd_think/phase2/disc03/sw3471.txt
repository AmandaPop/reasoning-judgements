the entire conversation.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, you don't have any children?  

B.2:  No, we were never blessed with children.  

A.3:  Oh. 

B.4:  We had a foster child for a while and we're real active -- 

A.5:  Oh. 

B.6:  -- in church with some of the young people.   

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  I hear, I heard one of yours [laughter].  

A.9:  Oh, yes, we have four [laughter].  And they range in ages from eight until
the youngest is eight months so,

B.10:  So you have a considerable range of, of, interests and activities and so
forth.

A.11:  Right, we do, and [throat_clearing], when they were speaking about some of
the activities that you like to participate in as a family, one of our very
favorite is reading.  We love to read with our children and to them and, and
so far they've been, they've grown up with a love for reading, too and we're
very glad about that.

B.12:  That's terrific.  You know, that's not, I, I have heard that that's not
done enough these year, these days.

A.13:  Oh, yeah.  

B.14:  When we had our foster son, he was, uh, uh, two and a half to three and a
half, that, that year --

A.15:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- in there and we read every night -- 

A.17:  Oh. 

B.18:  -- because we just felt like that was important to spend time with him.

A.19:  Boy, I'll say.  

B.20:  There's so little time, one-on-one time these days -- 

A.21:  Right.  

B.22:  -- with the mechanical or, or the electronic, uh, games and, and T V and so
forth to draw folks away.

A.23:  Boy, I'll say, that's right.  My, with our, well, with all of them, we
started right from the time they were born and, and spent time reading with
them and, and they, they enjoy it.  The kids would get the books and bring to
us and say, you know, let's read a book.

B.24:  Did they have them memorized,  

A.25:  [Laughter]. 

B.26:  and, and know if you're skipping a page [laughter].

A.27:  Yeah, they do.  They do.  Did you experience that, too?  

B.28:  Yes.  

A.29:  [Laughter]. 

B.30:  On nights when it was already really late and I'd try to short circuit 
it --

A.31:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

B.32:  -- it was, no, no, no [laughter].  

A.33:  [Laughter] And they catch on pretty quick [laughter].  You mentioned T V
watching, watching too much T V and I, I feel that's a real big problem also.
I, I think that there's just too much, that it's used too much as a
baby-sitter and and, 

B.34:  I, I totally agree.  

A.35:  People just plop their kids down in front of it. 

B.36:  Now, there are some wonderful programs for children and -- 

A.37:  That's right.  

B.38:  -- when I had a foster son -- 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- I was baby sitting, I had four under the age of three [laughter] --

A.41:  Oh, wow.  

B.42:  -- we ended up using television couple times a day [noise] when Sesame
Street was on --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- to entertain them, but also to do some learning things.  

A.45:  Right.  

B.46:  And then we re-enforced that then with, with some of the things that we
were involved in.

A.47:  Oh. 

B.48:  If I was in the kitchen and, and so forth, the little girl wanted to
emulate everything [laughter] I did.

A.49:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.50:  And so, and we talked about the letters and numbers and so forth.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  So, we used it as a tool -- 

A.53:  Right.  

B.54:  -- but not, I won't say I was perfect, it wasn't ever used as a 
baby-sitter --

A.55:  Oh, that's right.  

B.56:  -- while I was busy with one of the others but,  

A.57:  That's right, and I can't say [laughter], 

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  say that either.  But, then, like you say, there's some good shows on,
and there's some good videos also that you can rent that are --

B.60:  Yes.  

A.61:  -- you know, real helpful and, uh, we also like to play with our kids.  I,
one of, one of our other favorite things to do is to have pillow fights with
them [laughter].

B.62:  Oh. 

A.63:  And they really enjoy that.  They laugh and, you know, it's winter here and
it's hard to get outside and do a lot of [lipsmack], a lot of outdoor physical
type things and so,

B.64:  I hadn't thought about that.  

A.65:  Yeah, so we, we do pillow fights and, uh, course just play with them, play
games and, uh, when you were growing up, did you spend time, did your family
camp or, or what other activities,

B.66:  We did, we went camping and then Richard and I did that all through our,
our twenty years together, too.

A.67:  Oh.

B.68:  So, it was something that carried over from both our backgrounds and --

A.69:  Uh-uh.

B.70:  -- into our current life.  

A.71:  Oh, that's great.  

B.72:  Your, your pillow fights reminded me, though, when, when I was growing 
up --

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- uh, we, we spent four years in Utah and then we went -- 

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- from there to Germany and, and -- 

A.77:  Oh. 

B.78:  -- it was even further north.  

A.79:  Oh, boy, I'll bet.  

B.80:  And, uh, daddy used to rough house with us in the winter time with us.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  He'd get on the floor and just --  

A.83:  [Laughter]. 

B.84:  -- you know, play tickle games and -- 

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- and, and hug and cuddle and that was important to do that bonding, and 
I --

A.87:  Oh, it is.  

B.88:  -- never thought of that till you mentioned the pillow fights. 

A.89:  Oh. 

B.90:  But we'd get everybody involved in that, well, it was just my brother and 
I --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- and we thoroughly enjoyed that, that time spent with daddy that we
didn't get to see him very much at all.

A.93:  Boy, I'll say.  I'll say you do, and I think, like you say, the bonding and
the physical, you know, loving and touching, that's, that's very important, I
feel like.  So, uh,

B.94:  Do you have outside the home activities that, that you do with the, the
family?

A.95:  Yes, we do, we, well, like I say, we, the little community we live in, it's
winter a lot of time [laughter],

B.96:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.97:  So we go sleigh riding and, the kids love that, they love -- 

B.98:  Oh. 

A.99:  -- that.  They have several hills close by that we, that are kind of
designated sleigh riding hills and, and we take the t-, you know, the tubes
and toboggans and, and go and do that in the winter and in the summer, uh, oh,
[sniffing] bike riding and we go, well, we've, we've each got a bike, with the
little one, we haven't done it this last summer as much because she's just was
so tiny that --

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  -- we didn't get a chance, but, uh, we've got the swings and had a
trampoline,
