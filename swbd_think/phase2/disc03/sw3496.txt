===========================================================================

A.1:   Okay, do we just go ahead?  

B.2:   Uh-huh.  

A.3:   Okay.  

B.4:   Do you want to start?  

A.5:   Uh, [lipsmack] well, we're supposed to talk about 
vacations -- 

@B.6:   Right.  

A.7:   -- and, uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on
that I liked the most and [noise] probably the one I liked most was
Hawaii [laughter].  

B.8:   Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii?  

A.9:   Yes.  

B.10:   Yeah, we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. 
It's lovely, isn't it?  

A.11:   Yes.  We went, uh, six months after we were married.  

B.12:   Uh-huh.  

A.13:   And we just went to, uh, two islands.  

B.14:   What islands did you go to?  

A.15:   We went to Oahu and Kauai.  

B.16:   Kauai, uh-huh.  We went to Kauai, and then we also hit Maui,
and then, of course, uh -- 

A.17:   The big one.  

B.18:   -- uh, the big one, uh-huh.  

A.19:   Oh. 

B.20:   With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.  

A.21:   Oh, yeah.  It was.  

B.22:   But the other two were just lovely.  

A.23:   Yes, I enjoyed Kauai better, too.  

B.24:   Uh-huh, it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.  It
wasn't commercialized.  

A.25:   Oh, it was rainy [laughter].  

B.26:   Yeah [laughter], was it?  

A.27:   Rainy, but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go
over there and sit on the beach anyway so,   

B.28:   That's right.  

A.29:   [Laughter]. 

B.30:   Well, it wasn't real rainy.  We had s-, a few showers, but,
uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very
brief ones and, and, when, uh, now we went to Nassau and my husband
liked it better than he did Hawaii.  

A.31:   Oh, really?  

B.32:   Uh-huh.  

A.33:   Oh. 

B.34:   Yeah, he really did.  I don't know why.  You know, he didn't
like Oahu at all [child].  He thought -- 

A.35:   Uh-huh.  

B.36:   -- he thought Honolulu was just horrible [laughter], you
know.  

A.37:   Oh. 

B.38:   Although we went to that Polynesian Village.  Did you go
there?  

A.39:   Uh-huh.  

B.40:   That was wonderful -- 

A.41:   Yeah.  

B.42:   -- and we both enjoyed it -- 

A.43:   That was [child].  

B.44:   -- very much.  

A.45:   That was nice, uh-huh.  You know, I've been to Nassau, too.

B.46:   Have you?  

A.47:   I went on a cruise.  

B.48:   Oh, neat.  

A.49:   Uh-huh, and, uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather
just go to the island.  

B.50:   Yeah, uh, our son and daughter-in-law [child] just,
uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise.  And I
know they didn't like it.  Now, we have several friends that, uh,
have been on, and just love them.  But James and I like, I don't
know, I think we would get bored on the boat all the time.  

A.51:   Well, I, [breathing] got sick.  

B.52:   Oh, did you?  

A.53:   Yeah, I did the first night.  I went -- 

B.54:   Ooh.  

A.55:   -- with my sister -- 

B.56:   Uh-huh.  

A.57:   -- just, uh, a couple years ago and, and we both, the first
night, just had to leave dinner. 

B.58:   Um.  

A.59:   It was bad, but, and then after that it was, it got better,
but we just, it was a four day -- 

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- and we were both ready to get off the boat.  

B.62:   Were you?  

A.63:   Yeah.  

B.64:   Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day. 
Now we've been real lucky.  We've been to Europe twice.  

A.65:   Oh, have you?  

B.66:   Yeah.  We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and
touched a little bit of Scotland [dishes].  And second time we went
to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved [noise]
Germany.  

A.67:   Oh. 

B.68:   It -- 

A.69:   Wow.  

B.70:   -- is just absolutely gorgeous -- 

A.71:   I'll bet it is.  

B.72:   -- with the mountains and we were there in the fall before the
snows, you know, started and it was wonderful.  It, uh -- 

A.73:   Oh.  

B.74:   -- it was just, it was marvelous.  And we would love to go
back there and we'd love to go back to London.  

A.75:   You haven't been to Spain?  

B.76:   No --

A.77:   Oh.

B.78:   -- have not been to Spain.  

A.79:   I was born there.  

B.80:   Were you?  

A.81:   Yes [laughter].  

B.82:   How old were you when you left?  

A.83:   Uh, just ten months.  

B.84:   Oh, ten months, uh-huh.  

A.85:   Yeah, so,  

B.86:   Have you ever got to go back?  

A.87:   No, no, and I would like to.  

B.88:   Would you?  My, uh, [lipsmack] my sister, we went with them
to Germany and, uh, she would like to go to Spain.  I'm not sure
whether I would like to or not.  

A.89:   Huh.  

B.90:   And, uh, I would like to go to Ireland.  

A.91:   Would you?  

B.92:   Uh-huh.  

A.93:   Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from -- 

B.94:   Well, the -- 

A.95:   -- the -- 

B.96:   -- (( )) there is -- 

A.97:   -- the problems.  

B.98:   -- uh-huh, is, is a little scary, but I would still like to
see it.  I'd like to see, uh, [noise] Italy.  

A.99:   Oh, yeah, yeah.  

B.100:   I would love to go there.  

A.101:   That would be nice.  

B.102:   And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I
still want to come, you know, go to.  

A.103:   Now, have you been to Yellowstone?  

B.104:   Uh,  

A.105:   Yellowstone,  

B.106:   Yes, yes.  

A.107:   Have you?  

B.108:   We have been there.  We, I was there as a child and then we,
we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our
kids.  

A.109:   Uh-huh.  

B.110:   And they loved it.  

A.111:   Well,  

B.112:   I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster. 

A.113:   Oh, uh-huh.  

B.114:   So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.  

A.115:   Yeah, now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt
Lake.  

B.116:   Oh. 

A.117:   So, uh, it's at -- 

B.118:   Yeah.  

A.119:   -- my husband works in Salt Lake, so -- 

B.120:   Uh-huh.  

A.121:   -- we're real close and, yeah, we,  

B.122:   Now that's a pretty city.  

A.123:   Yes, we, we like it.  

B.124:   Very clean.  

A.125:   Yeah.  

B.126:   You know.  

A.127:   It is.  

B.128:   Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.  

A.129:   Well, we kind of like it [laughter].  

B.130:   Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.131:   Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?  

B.132:   We, no, we used to [child].  We used to camp a lot with our
kids.  

A.133:   Uh-huh.  

B.134:   And, uh, but now [child] we like things like the Regency Hyatt
[laughter].  

A.135:   Oh, you like the motels?  

B.136:   We like the motels, yes [laughter].

A.137:   Oh, oh, well.  

B.138:   We have, we've gone past the camping stage.  We lived in
[child] Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.  

A.139:   Oh, did you?  

B.140:   And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys and it
was beautiful and our kids loved it and everything and then we
moved to, uh, [child] uh, the Dallas area -- 

A.141:   Uh-huh.  

B.142:   -- and, uh, it's hot down here and camping is not near as much
fun.  

A.143:   Oh. 

B.144:   And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and
were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the
wayside.  

A.145:   Huh.  

B.146:   And, uh, although our son loves to fish and, uh, and our
daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping
with their boys now that they have gotten older.  

A.147:   Uh-huh.
