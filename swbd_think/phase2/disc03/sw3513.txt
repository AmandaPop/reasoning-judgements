=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, uh, let's see, what type of car do I want?  Well, I'd like to have a
Corvette.

B.2:  Oh, wow.  

A.3:  [Laughter]  But my, uh, weekly wages don't [laughter] apply for me to have
that kind of car, so --

B.4:  Yeah.  

A.5:  -- uh, I'm engaged to get married so, I'll more likely get a car for
economic reasons.

B.6:  Right.  

A.7:  Yeah, and, uh, so, uh, to drive back and forth to work is all I'll need a
car for pretty much.  And we have a truck, so probably a economic size car or,
uh, 

B.8:  What kind of a car do you have now?  

A.9:  Right now I have a eighty-seven Cavalier.  It's a piece of [laughter],

B.10:  [Laughter] My car is really old, too, because, uh, I drive out of town a
lot of the weekends --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  -- and, uh, I would like my next car to have good gas mileage. 

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  And, uh, same here, uh, you know, a nice car, American made and, uh, you
know, a, a nice car, but not too expensive, because, uh, I couldn't afford
like a brand new like Lamborghini [laughter].

A.15:  [Laughter]. 

B.16:  I hardly drive,  

A.17:  But while we're talking, right [laughter].  

B.18:  While we're talking, my next car, I'd like to be sporty and, you know --

A.19:  Right.  

B.20:  -- nice, but, you know, it's expensive and then insurance is really high
for that, too so, 

A.21:  Oh, I know.  

B.22:  Something with a, that's not too sporty because of insurance, then
[laughter].

A.23:  Right, that insurance does come into play.  I forgot about that.

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  What kind of insurance do you have up there or is it real high up there?

B.26:  Uh, no mine just got lowered because I just turned twenty-one and, uh, I'm
not sure really how much I pay.  I just, my mom's helping me out, you know,
because I'm a college, I'm in college and, uh, so I just give her the money
[laughter] --

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  -- and take her word for it [laughter].  

A.29:  Right, I mean that insurance is high dollars.  

B.30:  Yeah, yeah, it is, so,  

A.31:  But,   

B.32:  And the more expensive the car, the higher it is so,   

A.33:  Right, yeah.  

B.34:  Unless I win the lottery, I won't be driving,  

A.35:  [Laughter]. 

B.36:  anything too expensive.  

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  I don't plan on buying a car for many, many years [laughter] so, 

A.39:  Right, yeah.  

B.40:  I have to make this one last as long as I can.  

A.41:  What's everybody drive up there?  

B.42:  Uh, in Kenosha?  [Laughter]. 

A.43:  I mean in Wisconsin, they drive them little -- 

B.44:  Oh, it just is,  

A.45:  -- four wheelers or four wheel drive or, do you all need four wheel drives
up there because of snow and everything?

B.46:  Yeah, we, we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because, uh, because of the
snow, you mean or, 

A.47:  Right, it never snows down here, so,   

B.48:  [Laughter]  Well, we don't have any snow here now.  

A.49:  Really?  

B.50:  It all melted.  Yeah, there is no snow at all.  

A.51:  We haven't had snow yet.  We usually only get like once a year or so.

B.52:  Huh.  

A.53:  Kind of strange to you all, huh?  

B.54:  Yeah.  

A.55:  [Laughter]. 

B.56:  Yeah, it is.  

A.57:  Because, how, it's like seventy degrees here right now.  

B.58:  Oh, don't tell me that [laughter].  

A.59:  Yep, how, how cold is it there?  

B.60:  Well, actually, it's been warm, it's in the forties.  

A.61:  Really?  

B.62:  Yeah, and that's, that's really warm.  

A.63:  Huh.  

B.64:  Uh, and it's supposed to rain tomorrow so we, I've only seen snow once this
year.  And it was really bad and then it all melted like within the week.

A.65:  Really?  

B.66:  And now there is no snow, so,  

A.67:  Huh.  But, um, so what, what is your dream car?  

B.68:  Uh, I haven't really thought about it.  I'm not too big on cars.  I mean, I
don't know the names and stuff, but if I were to go to a car lot and like look
at them --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- [Laughter] I would pick out one that, you know [laughter] looked really
nice.

A.71:  What's your favorite color?  

B.72:  Uh, for a car?   

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  Probably blue.  

A.75:  Blue?  

B.76:  Like if it, you know, was just an average, middle class car.  But if I were
to get a sports car, maybe white or red [laughter].

A.77:  Right [laughter], right.  

B.78:  [Cough] Yeah.  

A.79:  So, what kind of car do you drive right now?  

B.80:  Uh, it's a Sky Hawk Buick.  

A.81:  Really?  

B.82:  Eighty-three, I think.  

A.83:  Really?  

B.84:  Yeah, uh, like eighty-two thousand miles.  

A.85:  Really?  

B.86:  Yeah.  

A.87:  Oh. 

B.88:  I'm afraid it's not going to last me [laughter] that long and I hope it
does, though.

A.89:  Yeah.  

B.90:  It's a two door.  I like, I like smaller cars.  They're, I find them more
comfortable to drive.

A.91:  Right, does everybody have their windows tinted up there?  

B.92:  Uh, no, I don't see too many cars tinted.  

A.93:  Everybody has tinted down here.  

B.94:  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.  I could, I could see why.  

A.95:  So, you been down here before?  

B.96:  Yep.  

@@A.97:  Really?

B.98:  Uh,  

A.99:  Did you like it?  

B.100:  It was busy [laughter].  

A.101:  Yeah, it's different -- 

B.102:  Yeah,  

A.103:  -- I bet, huh.  

B.104:  It was nice.  I remember, uh, swimming on Easter day and it was like really
cold up here, but --

A.105:  Right [laughter].  

B.106:  -- came back with a little tan, so that was nice [laughter].
