A.1:   Laurie?  

B.2:   Yes.  

A.3:   Okay.  I'm supposed to ask you, how do you make use of your
credit cards and I'm supposed to compare those with my, my habits. 

B.4:   Okay.  How do I make use of credit cards?  

A.5:   Yes.  

@B.6:  Um, let's see.  I carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly
because I don't ever have cash.  

A.7:   Right.  

B.8:   And I don-, I, do you work for Texas Instruments?  

A.9:   No, I do not.  

B.10:   Okay.  Well, at T I we have to use what's called a
((tex teller)) -- 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   -- if we want to get cash out and those are only available at
T I.  

A.13:   Oh, okay.  

B.14:   So if I'm in a mall or something I can't get cash out without
paying extra money so I'm always using credit cards.  

A.15:   Sure.  Well, myself I always, tr-, I'm, I'm a traveling 
person -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   -- and I'm out of town quite a bit so I use credit cards quite
a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in
my car to my lounging, entertainment and for everything.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.  Yeah, me too.  

A.19:   So that's, uh, as far as using them outside that I'm not, I
don't use them too much but (( )) I, I think my wife is sort of
like you she uses a credit card,  

B.20:   #[Laughter].# 

A.21:   #most# of the time.  

B.22:   Yeah [laughter]. 

A.23:   So she does most of the shopping for our household so she'll
use them more than I will.  

B.24:   Uh-huh.  But do you get to pay the bills?  

A.25:   Yes.  

B.26:   [Laughter] Same at my house [laughter].

A.27:   So it's me I'm always, I'm the guy [laughter] that always goes
to like Dillard's and I'll go in and charge something and I'll have
to give them my driver's license.  They'll have to look up the
number because I'm never carrying a credit card.  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  Yeah.  

A.29:   But I do carry like my American Express and my Visa which I
use for, you know, primarily work type things.  

B.30:   Uh-huh.  Yeah.  

A.31:   This is my first call by the way, so [laughter]. 

B.32:   Oh, it's mine too.  

A.33:   Oh, is it really?  

B.34:   [Laughter] Yes.  

A.35:   All right so we're both beginners then.  

B.36:   Yeah.  

A.37:   I've had this for a couple weeks and I've been out of town so
this is my first time to, 

B.38:   #Oh, okay.# 

A.39:   #to use it.# 

B.40:   #Okay.# 

A.41:   #So,# 

B.42:   Now, did you pick this topic or were you given?  

A.43:   No, I was given this topic.  

B.44:   I see.  Okay.  

A.45:   Yeah, they give you, they assign you a topic, you call the
eight hundred number,  

B.46:   Right.  

A.47:   Have you tried it yet?  

B.48:   No [laughter]. 

A.49:   Okay.  When you call the eight hundred number, they assign you
a topic and, uh, pretty, uh, cut and dried [laughter].

B.50:   Huh, okay.  Um, let's see.  So how long are we supposed to
talk for?  

A.51:   I'm not sure.  A couple, about two minu-, three minutes I
think.  

B.52:   Okay.  

A.53:   But I really don't have too much more to say in regards to
credit cards.  I, one thing I've always tried to do is when I get
my credit cards, I always try to pay them off because I just sort
of detest paying interest.  

B.54:   Oh, yes. 

A.55:   #And, uh,# 

B.56:   #Definitely.# 

A.57:   like years ago my wife and I got married -- 

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- she was the one with a little bit (( )) than I was because
I had my credit cards, I think, up to the limit and I was giving
[laughter] everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that. 

B.60:   [Laughter] Oh.  That will cost you a fortune.  

A.61:   That was like thirty years ago so now it's a little different. 
We, I get a bill and I'll pay it the same day it comes in.   

B.62:   Yes, yes.  

A.63:   Or at least I try to, and I just kind of tell my kids how much
I hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule.  

B.64:   That's right.  Well, yeah, if you pay it that way it, I mean,
it really is, it's like getting a free loan for a while.  

A.65:   Oh, you bet it's ju-,   

B.66:   Which is what I do.  

A.67:   it's an absolute savings.  

B.68:   Or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement
before the bill comes in, 

A.69:   #You bet.# 

B.70:   #you get to# [laughter] keep the money.  

A.71:   That's, that's very handy.  

@@B.72:  Yeah.  It works great.  

A.73:   Well, I think that's all I have.  

B.74:   Okay.  Well, it was nice to meet you.  

A.75:   Nice to meet you and, uh, give it a try.  I think you'll enjoy
it.  

B.76:   Okay.   

A.77:   #Okay.# 

B.78:   #Thanks.# 

A.79:   Thank you.   

B.80:   #Bye-bye.#  

A.81:   #Bye.#
