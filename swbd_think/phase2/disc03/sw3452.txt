======================================================================

A.1:  All right Sandra, uh, what we are supposed to talk about this morning are,
and I, I can tell that you are, must be an expert.

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  Child care services.  

B.4:  Yes, yes.  

@A.5:  And my, my first question is, what criteria is normally applied by a
parent when they are selecting child care.

B.6:  Well,  

A.7:  What are they looking for in other words?  

B.8:  Well, in my experience, uh, I've never, I've been fortunate enough to be
able to stay home with my children, but, uh, I have given day care to other
children and those that have come asking me to give, you know, to tend their
children, uh, I guess it depends on the parent whether they're looking for a
preschool type situation where they want the children to learn, you know,
different skills and, uh, school --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- type things or whether they're, the children are younger and they just
want somebody to be there loving and nurturing.

A.11:  What age would you say, uh, a child should be before you could start
applying this business of teaching them a little bit, preschool information,
we talking what, six or seven --

B.12:  Um, 

A.13:  -- or four or five?  

B.14:  Uh, in my opinion, I, I would feel that four at the very earliest.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  I, I think that children need to learn how to get along with one another
and play and to be creative and, and to,

A.17:  They do seem to have a very much improved, uh, intellectual --

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  -- sort of a spirit and they're bright, they look around and, and they,
they know what's going on.  That's, that, I guess that's as important to say.

B.20:  I agree.  

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  Yes, I agree.  In fact, a lot of the kindergarten teachers that I've spoken
with said that they would prefer that preschools, per se, would be done away
with and that the children just had a chance to, you know, develop the social
skills that they say the --

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  -- the kids that come to school that have been to the preschool type
settings are, are almost far enough ahead that they're bored with school.

A.25:  Yeah.   

B.26:  And they need to learn to get along, but, uh, have you ever had children in
day care?

A.27:  I'm trying to think, uh, yes, we've had our children in day care --

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- a little bit, but not much.  I, the, the interesting comment I was going
to make was that when my children grew up, I felt very normal and, uh, with
them and I didn't consider a lot of these little details that we're talking
about.

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  But now that my grandchildren are growing up -- 

B.32:  Oh. 

A.33:  -- I look at them in a totally different style.  

B.34:  Oh. 

A.35:  I, I watch very closely their activities when I see them and I can, I can
tell,

B.36:  [Laughter].  

A.37:  when they're speaking more clearly the next day and -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- and when they are understanding situations more [laughter] carefully.

B.40:  Oh. 

A.41:  And I, I don't remember doing it.  Maybe I did automatically with my own
children, but --

B.42:  Oh. 

A.43:  -- uh, I'm just looking with a much higher technical detail at --

B.44:  Oh. 

A.45:  -- at the grandchildren.  

B.46:  Uh-huh.  Maybe you have more time as a grandfather [laughter]. 

A.47:  Well, I wish I did [laughter].  I'm still working.  

B.48:  Oh. 

A.49:  But I'll be retiring soon.  

B.50:  Oh. 

A.51:  It's, it's just that, uh, with grandchildren, they are for a short period
of time --

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  -- and you just look at them and you absorb anything you can from them and,
uh, you start re-, comparing when you get from them with what you got from
your own children.

B.54:  Oh. 

A.55:  But it was really a different environment.  

B.56:  Oh, yes.

A.57:  [Laughter].

B.58:  How many, it's been what, probably twenty, twenty years ago? 

A.59:  Something like that.  

B.60:  Yes.  

A.61:  Well, let me ask you this.  

B.62:  # Uh-huh.  #

A.63:  Is it difficult to find a day care when you have a, a specific
criteria of your own?  Is that -- 

B.64:  Uh,  

A.65:  -- is that hard to find?  

B.66:  I think it is.  In fact, I know that, uh, around here one of the major
problems that the working mothers have said they have is they will find a day
care provider and then she will stick with it for, oh, you know, five, six
months and then have something else come up and so then they are looking again
for another one.  Unless they go to the commercial day care providers and I
know in the community I live in, a lot of the mothers prefer just to have
their children go to someone's home.  And I know that that's, uh, there's a
risk with that with the insurance and, and different things like that, but I
know most of them prefer to have their children just in the, a mother and
child home --

A.67:  I see, yeah.  

B.68:  -- type environment.  

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  So, uh, I guess it just depends on what you're looking for and whether you
mind, if it was myself, I would rather have my children in that type of
environment rather than the, the big commercial day cares just simply for the
fact that there's so much illness that the little ones pass around and --

A.71:  That's true, yes.

B.72:  -- and y-, you know, that type of a thing and the, uh, and I don't know
what the one to one or, you know, what the ratio is --

A.73:  Sure.  

B.74:  -- for the adult providers and the children, but I would think
that if you had a small group, it would be, that would be my
preference anyway, so,   

A.75:  My, my daughter, my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland --

B.76:  Oh. 

A.77:  -- and they have over there what they call a Kresh.  

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  And so her two children go to this Kresh, which is a, an all
day, well about a six hour,
