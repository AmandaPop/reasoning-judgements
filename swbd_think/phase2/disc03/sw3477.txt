========================================================================

A.1:   Okay.  How did you find out about this?  

B.2:   Well, uh, my brother-in-law sent me the thing.  

A.3:   From Texas?  

B.4:   Right.  

A.5:   Oh [laughter].  

B.6:   And we're supposed to talk on voting, is that right?  

A.7:   Yes, uh-huh, uh, why we think there's such a short-, uh, low
turn out.  

B.8:   Okay, uh, do you want to start?  

@A.9:   Okay, well, I think there's a, uh, mult-, multiple reasons. 
I think first of all, a lot of people are fed up and they think
they don't really, their vote doesn't count.  

B.10:   Uh-huh.  

A.11:   And second of all, a lot of people just aren't educated to,
you know, that they should do that [laughter].  They should
participate.  

B.12:   They, maybe they don't realize the importance of it.  

A.13:   Right, we had, uh, city councilman that won by like a handful
of votes, you know.  

B.14:   Oh. 

A.15:   Ten votes or something.  

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   So, that would have made a big difference if people had turned
out for his opponent [laughter].  

B.18:   Boy, I'll say.  

A.19:   And, I think another reason sometimes, it's inconvenient -- 

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   -- the hours, especially in a Presidential election.  I don't
know why it couldn't go on for several days or why we couldn't even
phone in our vote, you know.  

B.22:   Uh-huh.  

A.23:   You can, you can, uh, now the colleges, you can register over
the phone.  I don't see why we couldn't vote over the phone.  

B.24:   Oh, that's an idea.  

A.25:   You know, I mean, computers and all.  

B.26:   Yeah, well, no, we don't [laughter], not,  

A.27:   Oh, you don't do that up there?  

B.28:   Yeah, we have the voting, but, uh,  

A.29:   I mean, you don't -- 

B.30:   Never the, 

A.31:   -- register for college there, they're doing that all over the
phone now down here.  

B.32:   Oh, wow.  

A.33:   At the big, at the big schools.  

B.34:   Oh, wow.  

A.35:   Now, what city are you in?  

B.36:   It's Mantua.  It's just a small, small community.  We probably
only have, like, oh, seventy, well, maybe seven hundred people
[laughter].  

A.37:   Really?  

B.38:   Not very many [laughter].  

A.39:   Oh, my, that's interesting [laughter]. 

B.40:   Right, so, when we vote, it's like you say, there's, it's a
handful of, of votes makes a difference.  In fact this last
November they had a vote and I think there was only like, oh, five
to ten votes within the three different, you know, the three
different people that were running -- 

A.41:   Right.  

B.42:   -- for the office.  

A.43:   Just a difference of five or ten?  

B.44:   Yes, yes.  

A.45:   That, uh,  

B.46:   In each of them, and so, like you say, it makes a difference,
but that's, that's a good idea about having it, the voting over the
phone.  Maybe someday it will -- 

A.47:   Right.  

B.48:   -- it will,  

A.49:   We could use our Social Security number or something.  There
ought to be some way that they could safe guard it but,   

B.50:   Yeah.  

A.51:   Uh, especially Presidential, because, you know -- 

B.52:   Right.  

A.53:   -- sometimes you do have to stand in line for a long time.  

B.54:   Right.  And, you know, I wonder what, I don't know what the
statistics are, but I wonder what age, uh, the least, has the least
good turn out for the voting.  

A.55:   Oh, that's a, a interesting point.  I have no, uh, no idea. 
I wonder.  

B.56:   I wonder if it's the younger people or the older or just in
the -- 

A.57:   Uh-huh.  

B.58:   -- middle-aged, or, or what it is that doesn't turn out.  My
guess would be the younger.  

A.59:   That's true.  I know a lot of them that don't vote, uh,
because my, I have a twenty year old -- 

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- and I know a lot of her friends don't vote.  

B.62:   Oh. 

A.63:   And, uh, I go to school right now, and -- 

B.64:   Oh. 

A.65:   -- I, I've heard kids say they don't vote.  

B.66:   Oh, just because they don't care.  

A.67:   I guess.  Well, they don't really read the newspaper much.  

B.68:   Oh. 

A.69:   I, you know, at that age, I can remember being in college the
first time and I was a journalism major and I hardly ever read the
paper.  

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   [Laughter]. 

B.72:   [Laughter]. 

A.73:   I mean -- 

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   -- it's appalling when I look back, but -- 

B.76:   [Breathing] Uh,  

A.77:   -- you know, I think that may be part of it, too, they're not
really informed.  

B.78:   Right, and I don't know how big of a problem this is, but I
wonder if, I've heard some people say on occasion that, that the,
the candidates, they don't care for any of them so they don't want
to, you know, they don't want to give their vote, vote for one or
of other just because they,   

A.79:   That's true.  

B.80:   [Laughter]. 

A.81:   That's very true.  I've heard people on talk shows -- 

B.82:   Uh-huh.  

A.83:   -- say that they feel that that's a statement when they don't
vote at all.  

B.84:   Right, right, that that's some, that's saying hey, you know,
we want somebody -- 

A.85:   Right.  

B.86:   -- better for the candidate.  I don't know, I think that's
kind of a cop out [laughter].  

A.87:   Cop out.  Yeah, I think so, too [laughter].  

B.88:   I really do, I think you ought to, you know, make your opinion
one way or the other.  I mean, if you, even if you don't agree
with,   

A.89:   I know, even if you're voting against somebody more than for
someone -- 

B.90:   Right.  

A.91:   -- which I usually am nowadays [laughter].  

B.92:   [Laughter]. 

A.93:   In the national elections, it seems [laughter].  

B.94:   Right.  

A.95:   Uh, I don't know when -- 

B.96:   We have,  

A.97:   -- when I voted for somebody with great enthusiasm, it was a
long time ago [laughter]. 

B.98:   [Laughter] I sort, this last election here in, in our
community, they had, uh, they counted them by hand, you know -- 

A.99:   Uh-huh.  

B.100:   -- the ballots, by hand, and I know that on the bigger ones
they have little, it's a punch card system.  Are you familiar with
that?  

A.101:   No, you, you punch something out?  

B.102:   Right, you, you h-, with your pencil, you just punch -- 

A.103:   Uh-huh.  

B.104:   -- you know, they have a little tray that holds the ballots. 

A.105:   Oh, no, I've never seen one like that.  

B.106:   And, and apparently it makes the, the counting a lot easier
for the -- 

A.107:   Oh. 

B.108:   -- for those that are counting it, but, uh, with just small
ones, they just go ahead and count it by hand and -- 

A.109:   Oh. 

B.110:   -- I really like the, the punch card one, because we got the
results so much sooner when it was over.  

A.111:   Right, well, we have, uh, where you fill it in with the lead
pencil and -- 

B.112:   Uh-huh.  

A.113:   -- and the machine counts it.  That's really fast, too.  

B.114:   Oh, oh, yeah, that would be.  They probably can -- 

A.115:   Well,  

B.116:   -- turn those results in.  

A.117:   Right, like a scantron -- 

B.118:   Uh-huh.  

A.119:   -- you know, they call it that goes through the machine.  I,
half the tests I take in school now are that way.  

B.120:   Oh. 

A.121:   So easy, I just stick them in this machine and get the number
out, you know.  

B.122:   Oh, wow, that's fascinating.  

A.123:   Right, right [laughter].  

B.124:   Oh.  So, have you ever run for any kind of,
