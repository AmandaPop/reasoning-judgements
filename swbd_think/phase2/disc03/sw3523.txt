REMARKS:        Water running in the background on Speaker A.  Rather loud 
background high pitch ringing throughout the conversation. 

========================================================================

A.1:  We're set.  

B.2:  Okay.  

@A.3:  What changes do you feel have happened?  

B.4:  Oh, I guess the first thing has been the, uh, for the right, for women to
vote.  I think that has been a major change and also the fact that, uh, there
are so mu-, many more women in the work force nowadays than there were and
that's probably going to increase.

A.5:  Right.  

B.6:  You know.  

A.7:  Increases each year, doesn't it?  

B.8:  I'm sorry?  

A.9:  It increases each year I think.  

B.10:  It sure does.  Yeah, there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays.

A.11:  Well, and I think women have kind of had, uh, in the past the real
subservient --

B.12:  Role?  

A.13:  -- role.  

B.14:  Right.  

A.15:  And, uh,  

B.16:  That's changing [laughter].  

A.17:  Well, we do to some degree -- 

B.18:  Right.  

A.19:  -- but, uh, uh, I think it's not as much as it was.  

B.20:  Right, yeah, I, I agree.  It definitely -- 

A.21:  I,  

B.22:  -- has changed.  

A.23:  And especially, I think with women increasingly working, they're going to
have to demand more [laughter] from men.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  Because there is just, i-, impossible to keep up on everything else.

B.26:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.27:  Have more of an active role in taking care of children, more of an active
role in taking care of the home.

B.28:  Well, you know, they've been talking about and I don't know, uh, what the
status is on it, but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that
and I know that they've, there has been discussion about men also getting
maternity leave --

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  -- to help out, but you know, I haven't really heard much about that
recently.

A.31:  Well, you know, there is a lot of companies that won't give mat-, women
maternity leave for that very reason.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  Uh, in fact, I know the school districts down here, you, they don't have
maternity leave.  Uh --

B.34:  Oh, is that right?  

A.35:  -- you simply have to take, accumulate your sick leave.  

B.36:  Oh. 

A.37:  And take your sick leave.  

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  And I don't know, uh, if bigger company companies do, but when I was
employed with the school district, I didn't have maternity leave either and
that was the reason because they thought was showing ((prejisim)) to women and
not to men but, 

B.40:  Huh, that's interesting.   

A.41:  So, uh,  

B.42:  That's a bummer, though [laughter].  

A.43:  Yeah [laughter], it is.  

B.44:  I mean,  

A.45:  You have to save all of your, uh, vacation time.  

B.46:  You got to take the time off [laughter].  

A.47:  You do.  You have to save all your vacation time and -- 

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- that's usually how it's, uh, happened, but, uh,  

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  What do you see, uh, changing in the future?  

B.52:  [Breathing] I think that we're probably going to see a lot more
companies, uh, run by females.

A.53:  Right, and, and -- 

B.54:  #And we'll prob-,#  

A.55:  -- #top level.#  

B.56:  I'm sorry?  

A.57:  Maybe top level.  

B.58:  Right, right, upper management, more women in upper management and
probably, uh, we'll see more females in political roles.  More governors and,
I think, you know, roles like that.

A.59:  That would be kind of nice [laughter].  

B.60:  Well, we've got, in Texas, we have a female governor.  

A.61:  That's right, that's right.  

B.62:  And we had a female mayor here in Dallas, and she just, her term just ended
and, uh, so I think we're probably going to see more of that --

A.63:  Yeah --

B.64:  -- in the future {faint}.

A.65:  -- I think that's probably good.  A little more integration. 

B.66:  Uh-huh.  

A.67:  And, uh, maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners and, 

B.68:  Right, you know, I mean, and that's fine with me --

A.69:  I think, 

B.70:  -- but sometimes, I mean I'm not a women's libber by any means, but --

A.71:  Right.  

B.72:  -- I do, there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for
men and women and that kind of stuff, I totally am for.

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  But, I don't get into the, uh, the real [laughter] -- 

A.75:  #No, I don't either.#

B.76:  -- #women libber# movement, you know.

A.77:  I don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal
[laughter].

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  We just function differently [laughter].  

B.80:  Right, right.  

A.81:  And, uh, I'm not capable of lifting what, uh, a man can lift and --

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  -- you know, that type of, that type of thing, but, uh -- 

B.84:  Right.  

A.85:  -- one of the big changes, uh, they're doing in Salt Lake is, uh, and
they're probably, I'm sure, in Dallas since you're big places, a lot more
women are, uh, working right out of their home with their P C's or with their
lap computers or whatever.

B.86:  Yeah, I, I've heard of that.  Uh, I haven't really talked to anybody
that's, you know, too involved with that.  But, I mean, I think that is a,

A.87:  #I think that,# 

B.88:  #Like the# cottage industry.  Is, is that what you're talking about, women
working out of their homes?

A.89:  Right.  

B.90:  Yeah, uh, I think it's wonderful [laughter].  

A.91:  Right.  You only have to check in with the office once or twice a week 
and, 

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  Course, they're talking about, uh, that we're going to be able to do our
grocery shopping and [laughter] --

B.94:  Oh, I kn-,   

A.95:  -- banking and -- 

B.96:  By the phone and all that.  

A.97:  -- everything like that, so, uh, it would be kind of exciting in some ways
to, to see a little bit more of that and some ways, it might be kind of
[laughter] scary.

B.98:  Right.  

A.99:  Think anybody could do it, but,  

B.100:  Right.  

A.101:  Anyway,  

B.102:  Yeah, I wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my
order and --

A.103:  Right.  

B.104:  -- going an hour later and picking it up [laughter].  

A.105:  Right, but then you know, there is the process of selection.  Would you
have to give them [breathing] --

B.106:  Right.  

A.107:  -- the brand and, uh,  

B.108:  Right.  

A.109:  You know, when you shop, you usually compare the prices and, would be nice,
though.
