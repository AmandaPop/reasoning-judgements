======================================================================

A.1:  Did they mention our topic?  

B.2:  Yes.  

A.3:  Okay.  

B.4:  Vacation spots.  

@A.5:  Right.  Anything, anything in the area of types of vacations you've been
on lately you've really enjoyed?

B.6:  Well, I, I guess probably my favorite thing to do is to go to the beach.
Uh, and my most favorite place to do that is San Diego.  Uh, I love San Diego
very much.  But this past summer we went to, uh, Gulf Shores, Alabama --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- and had a great time there.  The beach was beautiful and, and that was
really, uh, a nice place to go.  So that's, that's probably one of my most
favorite places to go.  How about you?

A.9:  Well, I'm a lot the same way.  We, uh, I was raised, well, West Virginia,
but also Virginia and I spent an awful a lot of time on the Virginia Beach
area and I sort of love the water, I've always loved the ocean, so I enjoy
going to the beaches myself.  As far as a favorite beach, um, probably Myrtle
Beach is, as, as more of a younger person, I haven't been there for years.
I'd like to go back and see how it has changed, but I enjoy Myrtle Beach, I
enjoy Padre Island right here in Texas.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  But I enjoy pretty much any beaches.  

B.12:  I've, I've heard that Myrtle Beach is wonderful.  I have friends who think
that that's the best place in the world.  I've, I've never been myself but,
uh, you know, I've heard that it's a wonderful --

A.13:  Well, I haven't been,  

B.14:  -- place to go.  

A.15:  Right, haven't been for twenty years myself but,   

B.16:  Oh [laughter].  

A.17:  One of these days I'll go back and see how nice it is. 

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  I'm sure it's just as nice as ever.  As a, as a high schooler and a college
kid it was a great place to go.  It was the big weekend place --

B.20:  Sure.  

A.21:  -- and things like that.  Especially in the summer, the place to go in the
summer to get a, you know, a summer job and to spend your dollars and, uh,
have fun and everything.

B.22:  Sure.  Well, also one of my, I was thinking, another one of my favorite
places is, uh, Santa Fe [lipsmack].  Uh, have you ever been to Santa Fe, New
Mexico?

A.23:  No, I haven't.  

B.24:  Well, it's wonderful.  

A.25:  Oh, I'll bet it is.  

B.26:  Yeah, it really is a beautiful place and for the past two falls I've gone
there [breathing].  I've made two trips to Santa Fe.  It's sort of becoming an
annual thing for me.  Uh, I go by myself, I go without my family and, uh,

A.27:  What do you do?  

B.28:  Pardon?  

A.29:  What do you do while you're there?  

B.30:  Well, [breathing] I basically, uh, I love to visit churches.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  There are wonderful churches in Santa Fe.  It's a real, uh, it's just a
wonderful area.  And this past year, I went to a fabulous, uh, monastery.

A.33:  Right.  

B.34:  Uh, that's out in the desert.  Uh, out in the hills of Santa Fe.  I also
went to one of the Indian pueblos this past year and that was just wonderful.

A.35:  Yeah, my wife would probably enjoy, joy, we'd probably enjoy that also.
Are you Catholic?

B.36:  No, I'm not [laughter].  

A.37:  Okay, we're, we're Catholics so -- 

B.38:  Oh, you'd really enjoy it, then.  

A.39:  -- we'd, we'd def-, definitely enjoy all the old churches.  

B.40:  Well, you would love it because I have a great appreciation for, uh, the
Catholic church and for Catholic churches and all the ones I visit are
Catholic.  Uh,

A.41:  Right.  

B.42:  One of the places [breathing] that I went to is a little p-, town called
Tamayo.  It's out of Santa Fe --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- and they have, there's a sanctuary there.  There was supposed to be
some, uh, miracle healing that occurred there and it is just a fabulous place.
I, I [lipsmack], I just love Tamayo.  And it's about thirty minutes north of,
of Santa Fe.

A.45:  Oh, no kidding.  

B.46:  And,  

A.47:  We'll have to maybe give that a try sometime.  

B.48:  Well, I'd highly recommend it, particularly if you're Catholic.  I think
you'd have a great appreciation for it.

A.49:  If you're a, a water person, my wife still says the best vacation we ever
went on with our kids and as a family was we went to one of the Jack Tarr
Villages in the Caribbean --

B.50:  Did you?  

A.51:  -- and we went to one, the one located at Puerto Plotta.  

B.52:  Puerto Plotta.

A.53:  And, you know, that's the most reasonable vacation we were ever on.  We
just opened the paper one morning four or five years ago and it said round
trip, all included, seven days, hotel, food, all you could drink, just every
party, everything, it was almost like a cruise.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  But, uh, it was like five ninety-nine, so we said, let's do it, so we
packed up everyone, four of us, plus my son's girlfriend, we all went and it's
probably, not, like I said, not only the most reasonable vacation we were ever
on and everything was paid for, it was just glorious, I mean the water was
fantastic.  You g-, they had pools, they had beaches.  People were so
courteous.  The lodging was fantastic, the food was just like being on a
cruise ship.

B.56:  Huh.  

A.57:  Everything from Baked Alaska right on down and -- 

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  -- all this for five hundred and ninety-nine dollars.  

B.60:  I mean, that's unbelievable, the price [laughter].  

A.61:  Oh, it is unbelievable.  And we keep saying that one of these days, our
kids are getting older now, they're in college and, uh, be getting married and
whatever, so we doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to go back with our,
with our kids, but --

B.62:  Your kids.  

A.63:  -- but we're certainly going back, but, that's probably one place that we
really enjoyed.

B.64:  Now, that didn't include your airfare, did it?  

A.65:  That included everything.  

B.66:  Gosh.  

A.67:  Airfare, [laughter] lodging, every meal.  

B.68:  Good grief.  

A.69:  I mean, if you were a heavy drinker, you could sit there and drink
twenty-five or thirty drinks a day or whatever you wanted.  I mean, just, it
was everything.  And it was just a, a Caribbean type of surrounding.  Very
tropical, just, uh, entertainment every night.  I don't know if you've ever
been a cruise ship or not, but it was exactly like being on a cruise ship.

B.70:  Yeah, I've been on a cruise ship.  

A.71:  And we were on four cruises and, uh,
