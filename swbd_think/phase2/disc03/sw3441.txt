========================================================================

B.1:  My T V down.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  

A.2:  Uh, invasions of privacy.   

@B.3:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.4:  #Uh,# what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me
things.

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  #All,# 

B.7:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.8:  sorts of hours calling and ((telling)) me that I want investment advise and
I want this service and that service or the other thing.

B.9:  Yes.  I hate those [throat_clearing] canned messages they put on my
recorder.

A.10:  Um, my sense is that something may just have been done about it by
congressmen (( )) just what went into the (( )) something about the random
dialers that just dial phone numbers.

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your, your phone and, and,
and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not.

B.13:  Uh-huh.  

A.14:  Um, but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision
that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using and,
uh, and, uh, people, businesses would be prohibited, uh, from calling for
pers-, for, for business (( )) selling you things.

B.15:  #I have through,#

A.16:  #I'm sure that's true.#

B.17:  the phone company, uh, [throat_clearing] no nine hundred numbers can be
dialed from my phone or received.

A.18:  Uh, some of (( )) did too.  I think, I think government can do that now, is
that right?

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  And, uh, especially with, with possibly children around.  

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  Uh, that could, could be useful protection.  

B.23:  Right.  Yes, and I don't have children around but I just don't like those
nine hundred numbers.  So,

A.24:  So, uh, #I used to deal with,#

B.25:  #I've excluded those.# But isn't, it does not stop you from the, uh,
dialing services.

A.26:  What are dialing services?  

B.27:  Where they, uh, intend to sell you things.  

A.28:  Oh, oh, where people just, just call you.  

B.29:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And leave again that canned message on the,

A.30:  And you know, and then what, those problems has been eliminated those
problems used to be when I used a credit card --

B.31:  Uh-huh.  

A.32:  -- they'd want to have my phone number.  

B.33:  Uh-huh.  

A.34:  And I did not like giving it out.  I (( )) gave out my work number --

B.35:  Right.  

A.36:  -- but I think I'm not sure if it's by law just, otherwise I think the
practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number.

B.37:  Well, that's the thing I hated too about, uh, Radio Shack.  

A.38:  #How did Radio Shack work?#  

B.39:  #If you go in and buy# anything they want your phone number.  And I don't
think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning, and, and I
don't give that out.  I have an unlisted number so I don't,

A.40:  Yes, that's, that's, that's one solution but you, you, you nonetheless
often get, get people calling you?

B.41:  Sure.  

A.42:  Despite the fact that your number is unlisted?

B.43:  Uh-huh.  

A.44:  And ((you)) (( )) actually have your number or are they just calling a
number that happens to be yours?

B.45:  Well, [throat_clearing] anything that you buy -- 

A.46:  Uh-huh.  

B.47:  -- um, you ca-, you may get put on the, a, uh, preferred list that is
purchased.

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  And, and companies can purchase this list and what that is is people who
buy from the mail.

A.50:  Yeah, and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers.

B.51:  Uh-huh.  

A.52:  ((I'll be thinking in mind the address is)), um, is there anything you can
do about that like --

B.53:  Uh, no.  

A.54:  -- give out a phony phone number?

B.55:  Not really.  Um, no.  Uh, ((some of that)) unfortunately is legal.  So they
can't stop people from, uh, advertising and that, and that's what it falls
under.  It falls under the guise of advertising.  So, I don't care for it, but
is it a legal, uh, solution for some companies.  So that, that's the way
things are.

A.56:  Huh.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think it's gotten much worse the last,

B.57:  Uh-huh.  #Uh-huh.# 

A.58:  #few years.# Maybe that's just because I've gotten on more lists.

B.59:  Well, ((they, you know,)) that's, that's the telephone is not the only
invasion of privacy.  You've got the holy rollers and you've got, uh, all
kinds of people knocking on your door and, who want to, uh, either direct you
to the right path or, or want to, uh, sell you, uh, paper routes, uh,
whatever, so, um,

A.60:  #Yeah.  Sell you magazines.#

B.61:  #you know, it's not just the# telephone.  

A.62:  Uh-huh.  I guess whatever is, I just don't give,
