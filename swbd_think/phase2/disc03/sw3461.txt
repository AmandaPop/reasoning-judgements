=====================================================================

A.1:  Uh, I guess when I bring up camping, I think of going out and setting up a
tent and, and, uh, cooking out and that kind of thing.  What do you think of
it?

B.2:  Well, yeah, that's exactly what I think of, too, uh, that's the way I think
of camping, in a tent [laughter].

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  Not comfortably [laughter].  

A.5:  [Laughter]  Well, I know, we used to do that when our children were
younger and, uh, we could, uh, we even had it fixed up where we could setup a
tent and have a, have supper ready in about thirty minutes, so it worked out
real well for us then.

B.6:  Yeah, that's,  

A.7:  Have you ever done that?  

B.8:  That's great.  Well, when I was a kid, my father had all different kinds of
travel trailers.

A.9:  Oh. 

B.10:  Whatever he liked, he had a travel trailer and he had a Winnebago, and he
had a truck camper and he was always buying new things like that and I hated
it.

A.11:  Oh. 

B.12:  I hated going camping and, when I got older, I liked things like Caesar's
Palace, you know.

A.13:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  

B.14:  That's where I like to stay and, and,  

A.15:  Oh, okay, you can't, you are going to camp out at Caesar's Palace, huh?

B.16:  Right, exactly.  

A.17:  All right.  

B.18:  So this summer, uh, my boyfriend lives in California and he loves to go
camping and he said let's go camping and I went and I loved it [laughter].

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  And so my, my parents couldn't believe it, you went camping [laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter] Different perspective.  

B.22:  But, it was nice.  

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  It's peaceful and quiet and,   

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  It was just nice and I sat there and thought, what do I have at home that I
need that I don't have here [laughter]?

A.27:  Right.  

B.28:  And I couldn't really think of anything, so.  

A.29:  Now where did, what kind of country did you go camping in?  

B.30:  In California in the mountains.  

A.31:  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's so peaceful.  

B.32:  It was just beautiful and, uh, it wasn't very crowded, it was during the
week.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  And it was wonderful.  

A.35:  Yeah.  

B.36:  So, that was nice [laughter].  

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  So, I guess I do like camping [laughter].  

A.39:  Well, I think it depends on, probably, as a child, you didn't feel, you
left your friends at home and you --

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  -- didn't like there's much to do.  

B.42:  That's exactly right.  Boring to me [laughter].  

A.43:  Yeah.  What kind of places did your parents go to when they camped in the
trailers?

B.44:  Oh, they went all over.  

A.45:  Just, uh, various parks and things?  

B.46:  Yeah, I mean, they, they even moved.  They did, they went to parks, like,
uh, well, we lived on Long Island.

A.47:  Uh-huh.  

B.48:  We went to New Jersey and things like that, you know, not far away and then
to the extreme, uh, they sold everything and bought a house trailer --

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- and, uh, moved to Florida [laughter].  

A.51:  Oh, my.  

B.52:  And pulled it behind us and that was really funny because, I mean, it's
funny now, it wasn't funny then.

A.53:  No.  

B.54:  All these very strange things happened, I mean -- 

A.55:  Huh.  

B.56:  -- it was just really,  

A.57:  Let's see, Wildwood in New Jersey, did you go there?  

B.58:  Yes, yes, we did [laughter].  

A.59:  Uh-huh! [Laughter].  

B.60:  That's exactly where we went [laughter].   

A.61:  I thought you might.  I understand that's a very popular place if you live
in that area.

B.62:  Really?  

A.63:  Yeah, lots of, uh, my husband was raised in Pennsylvania.  

B.64:  Oh. 

A.65:  And, uh, some of his friends had always talked about, and what got me, they
never went anywhere on vacation but to Wildwood.

B.66:  [Laughter] And did they camp out?  Probably [laughter].  

A.67:  I'm, you know, I'm, they'd go to, go to the shore, go to the shore.

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  And we said, you know, really, there are other places in the world.

B.70:  Yeah, I wouldn't like to go to the same place all the time.  

A.71:  Uh-uh.  But they, we have these friends he went to high school with that
they go to the same place every year and have for the last twenty years.

B.72:  Yeah, that's boring to me, yeah.  

A.73:  I, you know, I guess it's fine if they like it, but I like to move around a
little bit [laughter].

B.74:  Well, there's so many places to go. 

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  If you went to a different one every time, you couldn't see them all
[static], so.

A.77:  That's true, and they each have their own special beauty.  

B.78:  Yeah.  

A.79:  Have you ever been, uh, up to, uh, Lake Texoma here in T-, uh, Texas?

B.80:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  

A.81:  That's pretty.  

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  They have a, a park up there, uh, Eisenhower Park.  Have you been there?

B.84:  Uh-huh, yeah, I have.  It's been a long, long time, though.  

A.85:  Now that's where our, one place where our children used to like to go.

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  Now they like to go out and fish and things like that and, course, they go
and do their own thing since they're grown, but, they, uh, they still talk
about our camping trips, so maybe they didn't dislike them so much.

B.88:  Oh, I'm sure [laughter].  

A.89:  But, uh, are you planning to go on any more camping trips?  

B.90:  Well, I don't know.  

A.91:  Well, if you get invited, huh?  

B.92:  If I get invited, maybe, yeah.  

A.93:  [Laughter]  That sounds good.

B.94:  [Laughter]  If I find time.  

A.95:  Yeah, you stay pretty busy here, then.  

B.96:  Oh, yeah.  

A.97:  What's about your ideal time when you go camping?  How long do you like to
go?

B.98:  How long to go for?   

A.99:  No, how many, how many, how many, a week, a, two weeks, a few days, or, 

B.100:  I, I don't know.  I've only gone that one time, about five,
