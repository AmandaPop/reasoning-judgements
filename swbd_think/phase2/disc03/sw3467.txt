A.1:   I said Arlington, Texas because the other day, I was talking
with somebody and he was in Arlington, Virginia [laughter].  

B.2:   Oh, no.   

A.3:   Yeah, that's the only one I've got now for this area.  

B.4:   Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.  

A.5:   Well, anyway, we've got a easy subject.  

B.6:   Yes, we do.  

A.7:   You go ahead first, if you'd like.  

B.8:   Okay, let me think here. 

A.9:   [Throat_clearing].

B.10:   Favorite, I haven't been watching much T V lately [laughter]. 

@A.11:   Yeah, you know -- 

B.12:   I used to.   

A.13:   -- you get so busy.  

B.14:   Yeah, I have, uh, I have one favorite soap opera.  I still
watch and I tape because I'm not home [laughter].  

A.15:   Oh, [laughter].  

B.16:   And, uh, let's see, that's GENERAL HOSPITAL, and then, uh, at
night, uh, I don't, uh, when I sit down, I don't usually sit down
till almost nine o'clock -- 

A.17:   I know.  

B.18:   -- when my kids get in bed and, and, uh, then I watch, uh,
what do I watch at nine o'clock.  Let's see, oh, well, Tuesday
nights I guess, we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids
like.  

A.19:   Right.  

B.20:   And, uh,  

A.21:   Are they little?  

B.22:   I have a seven year old and a ten year old.  

A.23:   Yeah, they're pretty young.  

B.24:   And, uh, so we usually catch, uh, FULL HOUSE, and, uh, what's
the one comes on after that.  It's a new one, uh, [lipsmack],  

A.25:   I don't know, my kids are older -- 

B.26:   Uh-huh.  

A.27:   -- so I don't, I don't know some of those shows now, like I
used to [laughter]. 

B.28:   Yeah, yeah.  Uh, other than that, uh, oh, gosh.  I watch
KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights,  

A.29:   [Laughter]. 

B.30:   for pure entertainment, nothing else.  

A.31:   Right.  

B.32:   Yeah.  

A.33:   Well I, I like the comedies.  They're just light, too.  I have
to watch MURPHY BROWN I really like,    

B.34:   Oh, now that is a good one.  

A.35:   I make a point of -- 

B.36:   That is.  

A.37:   -- that.  

B.38:   Yeah, if I'm home on Mondays, then I, I definitely watch her. 

A.39:   I love that and I really like COACH.  I think it's, when it's
good, it's just a scream.  

B.40:   Yeah, yeah, well, he's a good actor.  He really is good.  

A.41:   Well, he's probably playing himself.  Half the time you see
these people on an interview show, they're, they act just like they
do in their parts [laughter].  

B.42:   Yeah, yeah [laughter]. 

A.43:   He, I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once and he acted about the
same [laughter].  

B.44:   Oh, God.  Well, he could very well be [laughter].  

A.45:   Yeah, and, uh,   

B.46:   So, do you watch much T V, or,  

A.47:   Well, I watch more now because, well I, I had been going to
school for years and have really been too busy -- 

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   -- but this semester I'm only taking one course and so I see
MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS.  I just make a point
of seeing those.  

B.50:   Now, I never see that.  Well, I've got a friend that says that
is just wonderful show.  

A.51:   Oh, it's fabulous.  Really, you should never miss that.  It,
they are just gems of shows.  

B.52:   Oh, nice.  

A.53:   I mean, they really, fabulous in every way [laughter].  

B.54:   What, now what night is that on now?  

A.55:   Oh, that's Wednesday at, uh, seven thirty.  

B.56:   Wednesday at seven thirty, oh, okay.  Yeah, Wednesdays I, I go
to church choir, so [laughter].  

A.57:   Oh, yeah.  

B.58:   That's my one night out and about, so,  

A.59:   Sure, yeah, well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for
you sometime.  

B.60:   Yeah, I should get him to do that.  

A.61:   Just so you get the idea.  #It wouldn't take,#

B.62:   #Because I know,#

A.63:   Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those [laughter].  

B.64:   Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.  

A.65:   So, so, I watch those.  

B.66:   Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like
or,   

A.67:   Well, you know, I haven't, oh, yeah, we started watching
NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  Well, it's not really new, but it's still kind
of new.  

B.68:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  How's that?  I haven't seen that.  

A.69:   I like it a lot.  It's real different.  In fact, they never
thought it would be a hit.  

B.70:   Huh.  

A.71:   I mean, they'll have some things in there that almost, almost,
you know, like supernatural, or something, you know, I mean,
somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does or,
I mean, it sounds weird, but, it's very, uh, unique show and very
well done.  

B.72:   Huh.  

A.73:   Excellent actors.  

B.74:   I'll have to watch for that.  

A.75:   I, I guess we just, it came on after something we used to
watch -- 

B.76:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.77:   -- and I guess we just kept sitting there and then now we make
a point of watching [laughter].  I can't take all these shows on
because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any
television.  

B.78:   Uh-huh [laughter]. 

A.79:   Well then, it will be mostly reruns, I guess [laughter].  

B.80:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.81:   And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.  

B.82:   Gosh.  

A.83:   But, uh, 

B.84:   Well, we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN, but, uh -- 

A.85:   Yeah.  

B.86:   -- I haven't seen that much lately.  

A.87:   Yeah, I've seen that.  

B.88:   Since they got rid of, uh, Delta Burke and, uh -- 

A.89:   Was she the, was she the best one? 

B.90:   -- brought on the new ones.  

A.91:   Was she the best one on that old show?  

B.92:   Oh, she was just funny.  

A.93:   Really?  

B.94:   She was really funny.  And her character was good.  I don't
know that it was her in particular --  

A.95:   Right, right.  

B.96:   -- but just the character.  So, uh,  

A.97:   Yeah, they had a big fight on that show, didn't they?  

B.98:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.99:   They were all accusing each other of everything in the world
[laughter].  

B.100:   Oh, that was awful and who knows still, what ha-, really
happened, you know.  

A.101:   Well, I know, gosh, you never will, probably.  

B.102:   Yeah, yeah, so,  

A.103:   Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy
trial for those who have cable.  

B.104:   Oh, I know.  

A.105:   I don't have cable.  

B.106:   Now I told (( )), no, we don't have that station either, so,
uh, I haven't been able to catch any of that, #but just what little
we caught on the news.# 

A.107:    #It's just as wild as any soap# opera, from what I hear on
the news.  

B.108:   Oh, I know it.

A.109:   And I think he's guilty as the devil.  

B.110:   Well, I don't see how he couldn't be, you know.  

A.111:   I know, what's in it for her.  There's never anything for you
to go to trial as a witness in a case like that.  

B.112:   Yeah, that's right.  

A.113:   Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those
rich -- 

B.114:   Oh, and they said -- 

A.115:   -- high powered lawyers.  

B.116:   -- this lawyer is unbelievable.  

A.117:   Um.  

B.118:   But, they said she held up so well yesterday.  

A.119:   I know, everybody was saying that and then, in the paper said
it so,   

B.120:   Yeah.  

A.121:   It should be interesting.  

B.122:   Oh, God.  

A.123:   Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says [laughter].  

B.124:   [Laughter]. 

A.125:   I was reading that in the supermarket line.  I never have the
nerve to buy the thing.  Uh,  

B.126:   Oh, shoot, well, do you watch any, uh --

A.127:   Says he, 

B.128:   -- any sports or anything like that or,  

A.129:   No, I don't care anything about that.  

B.130:   Because I don't either.  I can't, I can't watch it on T V, so
[children],   

A.131:   I like the ice skating, you know, occasionally, some ice
skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics -- 

B.132:   Uh-huh.  

A.133:   -- I always watch that.  I think it's so beautiful.  

B.134:   Yeah, I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes, too.  

A.135:   Oh, yeah, that's good.
