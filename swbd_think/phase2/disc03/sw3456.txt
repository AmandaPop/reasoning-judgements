B.1:   There we go.  

A.2:   Now we're ready [laughter].  

B.3:   Okay [laughter].   

@A.4:   Yeah, I had a, a family reunion this past year, first time in
many, many years. 

B.5:   Uh-huh.  

A.6:   And I had, uh, three of my sisters there with their family -- 

B.7:   Oh, great.  

A.8:   -- and we all got together in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and --  

B.9:   Oh. 

A.10:   -- spent the week there up in the mountains and rented a
little, little, little house and -- 

B.11:   How nice.  

A.12:   -- sort of visited and got to know each other.  We hadn't
been, been around each other for quite a while -- 

B.13:   Oh.  

A.14:   -- over the years, so, it really was sort of nice.  

B.15:   Well, that is nice.  Was it, was it awkward at first, or did
it work out fairly good?  

A.16:   Well, it worked out fairly well.  You know, [noise] as a kid,
I don't know about yourself, but we used to have big reunions -- 

B.17:   Yes, uh-huh.  

A.18:   -- and it's so nice and, and, you know, it's just something
that you don't do anymore.  

B.19:   Right.  

A.20:   And, uh, we had such a good time that -- 

B.21:   Uh-huh.  

A.22:   -- that we're already deciding to have one in two years say in
Disneyworld or somewhere -- 

B.23:   Oh, great.  

A.24:   -- in Florida just get together and -- 

B.25:   Uh-huh.  

A.26:   -- just something you need to make time for.  

B.27:   Now are you from, from quite a ways away from each other so
that you don't see each other real often?  

A.28:   Yes, we are.  We're sort of, uh, we're in Texas and I have
sisters in North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia -- 

B.29:   Oh [children]. 

A.30:   -- Florida, everywhere [laughter].  

B.31:   Oh, yeah.  

A.32:   So we're just, so [noise] we don't get to see each other very
often.  

B.33:   Oh, yeah, okay [children].  Well, we have, uh, several
different reunions.  When I was, like you say, when I was growing
up, we had a lot of family reunions and they were the extended, the
cousins and, you know, relatives and great-aunts and, and uncles
and, uh, those have dwindled down to just we go to one a year.  We
have one at Christmas time -- 

A.34:   Sure.  

B.35:   -- and it's my father's family and,  

A.36:   Well, that's great.  

B.37:   Yes, it is.  And, and these are people that we see, you know,
just once, maybe twice a year.  

A.38:   Uh-huh.

B.39:   And we get together then and have a Christmas party and, and,
you know, have a dinner and a program and renew acquaintances and,
uh, and then in the summer, on my mom's side of the family we, we
go camping up in, up in the mountains like -- 

A.40:   Oh, that's neat.  

B.41:   -- you mentioned.  Yes, it is.  It's fun.  

A.42:   Which you're in a great area for it.  

B.43:   Yes, we are.  There's lots of, lots of nice places to go.  And
I know some families have a real formal type thing where they send
out the letters and, uh, assignments and have parts on the programs
and quilt drawings and stuff.  We, we don't do anything that big,
you know.  

A.44:   Uh, a lot of people do that, but we're just not that well
organized.  

B.45:   [Laughter].  

A.46:   Everyone's heading different directions -- 

B.47:   Yes.  

A.48:   -- so it's very hard to get together.  

B.49:   Yes, that is.  In fact, I, in a, in a magazine, I'd read an
article about different ways to plan a family, family reunion and,
you know, if you had a real big, like you say, a real big
organization and a lot of, a lot of planning went into it, that
would, that would be great, but we tend to stick to the, call each
other and, you know, that, we plan them, those two that I mentioned
every year for sure but,   

A.50:   Sure, that's the important thing, just to,  

B.51:   Yeah.  

A.52:   The important thing is to do it.  

B.53:   That's right.  

A.54:   And that's great.  

B.55:   That's right, because you, you do, you forget.  The, the
cousins I have, they grow up and change and, you know, you wouldn't
even recognize them sometimes, other than these, these times that
you get together.  

A.56:   Oh, you bet.  

B.57:   So, do you have any with your extended family or is it mostly
your, your sisters and,   

A.58:   It's been mostly my sisters and brothers right now.  

B.59:   Uh-huh.  

A.60:   But, as far as cousins, we haven't done that, like I said
before, it's, God, in just forever.  

B.61:   Uh-huh.  

A.62:   I don't know how we'd ever get all of our cousins together.  

B.63:   [Laughter].  

A.64:   You know.  

B.65:   Yeah.  

A.66:   It's like, it's like high school re-, high school and college
reunions, uh, I didn't go, I, I just turned fifty years old
recently and -- 

B.67:   Uh-huh.  

A.68:   -- didn't go to the many reunions until I hit my twentieth, I
believe, and, of course, I haven't missed one since then -- 

B.69:   Oh. 

A.70:   -- because it's just so enjoyable.  

B.71:   Oh, yeah.  

A.72:   You get to see all your old friends and what's going on
[noise] and --

B.73:   Uh-huh.  

A.74:   -- it's a neat deal.  I look, I look forward to them.  

B.75:   Boy, I'll say.  Yeah, so, do you, when you have your, when you
got together with your sisters last year, did, was there a lot of
catching up to do?  

A.76:   Oh, yes.  

B.77:   Lot of changes that had happened -- 

A.78:   Yeah.  Kids, 

B.79:   -- since the last time.  

A.80:   Kids getting older, getting married --

B.81:   Uh-huh.

A.82:   -- and graduating high school and college and whatever.  

B.83:   Oh. 

A.84:   Just lots of things to catch up on and, and we spent that time
to do that.  

B.85:   Uh-huh.  Did you take your kids with you?  

A.86:   No, this was -- 

B.87:   Or was it the adults?  

A.88:   -- this was just for the big guys.  Just for the parents.  

B.89:   Oh, how fun.  Oh, that's fun.  

A.90:   It was sort of neat, though.  In fact, we, uh, we had a little
rule that we would, we would not take the kids with us this time. 

B.91:   Oh, uh-huh.  

A.92:   But all of our kids are a little older so,   

B.93:   That, that makes a big difference.  

A.94:   Yes, all of our kids are in, middle and high school and
college.  

B.95:   Uh-huh.  

A.96:   Some are married, so,  

B.97:   Oh. 

A.98:   So we just all got together and it was sort of neat.  

B.99:   That is, that is.  That's, it's a fun thing to do and I think
it's important that we keep doing that because everybody is so busy
you, you lose, you lose touch and you lose ties.  

A.100:   You bet, because mother and dad both were there so it really
paid off.  

B.101:   Oh, were they?  

A.102:   Yeah, it was neat and, and, and her four kids were there.  

B.103:   Oh. 

A.104:   And their spouses, so it worked out real well.  

B.105:   Well, great.  Boy, I'll say, yes, I, my brothers are scattered
all around, too, and that's, you know,

A.106:   Are they?  

B.107:   Yes, they're, [laughter] they're all over the pla-,
