B.1:  Okay, what do you feel are some of the main problems?  

A.2:  Well, I'm in a, I'm in an urban area.  I'm in Dallas.  

B.3:  Uh-huh.  

A.4:  And we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a
major problem, uh, even a more major problem.  Uh, in Dallas, some of the
major problems, uh, drugs seems to be re-, related to quite a bit of the crime
we have now.  There is a lot of theft, a lot of assault dealing with, uh,
people trying to get money for drugs.

B.5:  Yeah.  

A.6:  And, uh, I think that's a national problem, though.  

B.7:  It, it, it's -- 

A.8:  It's not unique,  

B.9:  -- pretty bad here, too.  We've had a lot of murders drug related and
stuff.

A.10:  Yes.  

B.11:  In Durham, which is right next to Raleigh.  

A.12:  Uh-huh.  Well, now, we're pretty close to the golden triangle, aren't you?

B.13:  Yeah, that, that Durham, Raleigh, and Chapel Hill is the triangle.

A.14:  Right, research triangle -- 

B.15:  Right.  

A.16:  -- and all of that.  And, uh, I'm sure you have a lot of students there,
uh, and a lot of researchers so you, you may have a, you know, perhaps a
little better economic climate, but, in all your cities now, it seems like
th-, there is a, a crowd that's really effected by this bill.

B.17:  Yeah, it's, it's really, it's, and I've seen in more in Durham than I have
in Raleigh or, or --

A.18:  Really?  

B.19:  -- or Chapel Hill.  Chapel Hill is kind of a, a ritzy city or whatever.  I
mean, it's kind of, I'm, I'm sure there is problems with it, but it has a
pretty low crime rate.  Compare, compared to, to, Durham has probably got the
worst.  They've had like forty-eight murders since the beginning of the year.

A.20:  Really?  

B.21:  And over half of it has been drug related.  

A.22:  Um.  Well, here, uh, I'm not sure how many Dallas has had.  I've, uh,
Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four, I, I don't know.  A, a
number every week.

B.23:  Yeah.  

A.24:  Uh, Dallas is having quite a few.  Seems like most of ours are occurring in
late at night or, or, like I say, drug related.  Uh, I guess the other thing
was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values.  Seems
like a, a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they
used to.

B.25:  Yeah.  

A.26:  Uh, I,  

B.27:  Well, that, and the, and the economy is so bad and,   

A.28:  The economy is lousy [laughter].  

B.29:  And so many people have been laid off and stuff.  They've done special
stories on the news, local news here.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  We had a lot of bank robberies and different, lot of break ins and stuff.
I know, like a week or so ago, I live in a, in a town house, which is, you
know, it's a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work, she
came home and everything in her house was total gone, light fixtures,
everything.  And nobody thought any different, they just thought she was
moving.  It was a moving man pulled right up to her house, broke in and stole
everything she owned [laughter].

A.32:  Boy that really, that really takes someone who is bold to do that.

B.33:  Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty bad [laughter].  

A.34:  Well, now, do you find that security is very good in, in a, in a town home?

B.35:  Uh, I would say so for the majority in, in our, in my little section of the
neighborhood because there is always somebody at home --

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  -- and we all know one another and, and, on our one little section of the
street we all know one another and know that we're not moving [laughter] and
different things like that.

A.38:  Well, that,  

B.39:  It's, I, I'm, I'm probably the, one of the youngest people that live over
here.

A.40:  I see.   

B.41:  Most people are, are, retired or, or, or, you know, they're, they're in
their forties or, or whatever.  So and I'm in my twenties, so I, I'm, I'm out
more than they are, but --

A.42:  Yeah.  

B.43:  -- they're at home at night, so I really don't worry about anything.

A.44:  Well, I think you hit on one point there is you know each other.

B.45:  Yeah.  

A.46:  I'm, I'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything.  Uh, I
am, oh, about three blocks off a major road and, uh, a couple of blocks off
another road that kind of runs, I guess you would say the neighborhood road,
it runs between the high school and the, the commercial districts and, uh, I'm
over the northeast part of Dallas.  It's a, in a nice neighborhood.  The
houses here, uh, before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so
and, course, everything's down ten to twenty percent now.

B.47:  Yeah, see, that's the same thing here.   

A.48:  But we have, uh, one, one thing that effects us is we have apartments that
are probably about a half mile away and now the economy is bad, they have
trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the, uh, they're not nearly as
selective as they used to be.

B.49:  Yeah.  

A.50:  And, course, that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex.  You
start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you
have drugs and a lot of other things so, uh, I'm sure that aggravates it also.

B.51:  Yeah.  

A.52:  But, unemployment now in Dallas, or in Texas is up around six point,
