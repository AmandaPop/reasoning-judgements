A.1:  Okay, go ahead.  What are you going to fix for Christmas dinner?

B.2:  You know, I [laughter] I think the simpler the better.  #We often,#

A.3:  #I think so# too, yes.

B.4:  We spend all day cooking and, uh, it's like Erma Bombeck's cartoon said it
[sniffing] you spend eighteen hours fixing your dinner and it takes twelve
minutes to eat it.

A.5:  That's right.

B.6:  Less than twelve minutes.

A.7:  Well, we're going to fix a turkey and a ham.  We're going to have about
fifteen people for dinner, and we're going to have all the fixings with that,
the dressing and also, you know, everything with the ham, so we're going to
have a real nice dinner.

B.8:  Well, th-, I think that sounds like fun.

A.9:  The thing that I think that's missing at the, uh,

B.10:  #[Breathing].#

A.11:  #little# Christmas parties, though, is, uh, fruits.  You fi-, you put out
grapes, people eat those up first and --

B.12:  Yes.

A.13:  -- you put out strawberries, they grab for those first.

B.14:  Right.  

A.15:  {Very faint} #I think it,#

B.16:  #And we kind of# get, uh, overdosed on the sweets, don't #we?#

A.17:  #Right.# I think that's what the problem, maybe that's, I think that way
because I can't have those sweets [laughter].

B.18:  Well, they #usually,#

A.19:  #So,# 

B.20:  don't do a whole lot good for us and, uh,

A.21:  [Breathing] That's right.

B.22:  [Lipsmack] I've been trying to think of something, uh, nifty to make for
neighbors and, uh,

A.23:  For neighbors?

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  I used to just bake cakes, and there's, there you go, more sweet #stuff.#

B.26:  #Right.# I thought people kind of get so overloaded, and most people are
trying to lose weight anyway.

A.27:  That's right.

B.28:  And, uh, so it's kind of hard to get away from that [laughter] hard #to,#

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  kind of deviate a little bit, #uh.#

A.31:  #Yeah.#  

B.32:  So have you got any good recipes that don't have, #uh,#

A.33:  #Well# I, I do, but they're at home.  I don't have #[laughter],# 

B.34:  #Yeah.#

A.35:  I'm at work right now and #I don't,#

B.36:  #That's true.#

A.37:  have them with me.

B.38:  That's right.

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  That's right.

A.41:  I have some sugarless recipes.  

B.42:  [Sniffing] Are you diabetic or, 

A.43:  No, I'm hypoglycemic.

B.44:  Oh, okay.

A.45:  So I have, um, recipes to make cookies without sugar.  We put, uh, fresh
applesauce, you know, fresh fruit in it, applesauce and, 

B.46:  [Sneezing].

A.47:  raisins and things like that in them.

B.48:  No, you probably [throat_clearing] that's the kind of direction you want to
go with food anyway.

A.49:  That's right.

B.50:  And, uh, nowadays food, it's, uh, almost everybody eats out of these boxes,
don't they?  [Laughter].

A.51:  They what?

B.52:  The T V dinners or the, #I think,#

A.53:  #Uh, you,#

B.54:  it's really changing to [sniffing] not spending so much time.  Everybody's
such in a hurry.

A.55:  Yeah.  They don't want,

B.56:  [Child_talking]. 

A.57:  to spend time cooking and baking and,

B.58:  Well, and I don't think they have the time as much, maybe.

A.59:  Well, when you buy,

B.60:  [/Child_talking]. 

A.61:  those prepared foods in a store like that, they're all, they either have
too much salt in it,

B.62:  #Oh, yes.#

A.63:  #in them,# or too much sugar in them.

B.64:  I'm, I just haven't, you know, acquired a taste for them, have you?

A.65:  No, because they're too salty, most of those --

B.66:  Yes [sniffing].

A.67:  -- dinners like that.  

B.68:  Most of them are.

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  In fact, turkey, uh, would be my choice of meal any time.  I, I'm a turkey
lover and,

A.71:  Oh, yes.  #Mine too.#

B.72:  #I could# eat turkey [child_talking] [sniffing].  Unfortunately, it's not
the easiest, uh, or it takes a while to prepare it [child_talking].

A.73:  That's right.

B.74:  But, uh, it's not necessarily hard, it just, you got to plan on five or six
hours to cook the thing #so,# 

A.75:  #Well,# that's why people usually have them on holidays, because you're
usually home #visiting and,#

B.76:  #[Child_talking] You're home# and you've got the time to cook them.

A.77:  And doesn't it smell good in the oven,

B.78:  [Child_talking].

A.79:  as it's cooking? 

B.80:  [/Child_talking].

A.81:  I said doesn't it smell good,

B.82:  #Yeah, in the,#

A.83:  #baking in the# oven.

B.84:  It just sets the, [noise] the mood.  I don't know what, uh, Thanksgiving or
Christmas would be without, especially Thanksgiving, without the turkey.

A.85:  That's right.

B.86:  Wouldn't quite taste right, would it?  [Child_talking].

A.87:  Huh-uh.  It wouldn't be Thanksgiving dinner without #the turkey.#

B.88:  #Well,# even going out to eat.  We had discussed going out to eat, and, uh,
I don't even care, at your best restaurant, it's just not the same on a
holiday to [/child_talking],

A.89:  Yeah, and I go out to eat on Thanksgiving, I still have a turkey dinner
#[laughter].#

B.90:  #Yes, yes.#  You'd still have to choose that, wouldn't you?

A.91:  Uh-huh.  I've gone out on Thanksgiving like that and had other foods, and
then I'd leave and I'd say well, that doesn't, it doesn't seem like it's
Thanksgiving to me.

B.92:  No.

A.93:  It seems like another day.  It's because you didn't, we didn't have any
turkey.

B.94:  [Child_talking].

A.95:  #[Laughter].#

B.96:  #Right, right.# You kind of get used to that.  Um, well, I think, I hope
that the trend is [child_talking] to change to more health conscious foods and
not have so many [child_talking] additives and, uh, preservatives and, you
know, you, it's hard to even to get a cold cereal that you don't feel like
it's sugar.

A.97:  That's right.

B.98:  [Child_whining].

A.99:  That's right.  Well, and the women just don't have time to cook anymore
like they used #to.#

B.100:  #No.#  Well,

A.101:  Because most of them work.

B.102:  And I don't mind cooking, it's just that, you know, after you think of the
hours it takes you, if you get very elaborate, sometimes it doesn't seem very
rewarding to cook that many hours,
