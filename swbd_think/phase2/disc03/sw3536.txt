========================================================================= 

A.1:  Well, what magazines do you subscribe to, Lori?

B.2:  Well, we have probably too many [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter].

B.4:  We've got not enough to keep up, I mean too many to keep up with.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  We get, uh, FORBES, FORTUNE, NEWSWEEK, SOUTHERN LIVING, TEXAS HIGHWAYS, and
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC #((I think))#.

A.7:  #Oh,# gosh, #yeah.#

B.8:  #I# think I've got them all #[laughter].#

A.9:  #Uh-huh.# Well, I, I take, um, right now I've kind of whittled mine down.
I just take VANITY FAIR [breathing] and, uh, HARPER'S and, #uh,#

B.10:  #Uh-huh.#

A.11:  HOUSTON CITY [noise] magazine.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  But, you know, I used to subscribe to TEXAS HIGHWAYS.  That's one of the
best magazines for the money going.

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  I mean, it's such a bargain.

B.16:  It #is.#

A.17:  #What,# I mean, what is it, like twelve dollars a year?

B.18:  Something like that, yeah.

A.19:  And then the photography is beautiful.

B.20:  It is.

A.21:  Yeah, it's, (( )) that's, I thought about it not too long ago, that, uh,
[breathing] I had seen an issue and I thought gosh, I ought to give my parents
that for Christmas, but I, of course, now it's Christmas, I haven't done it,
so maybe next year.

B.22:  Yeah [laughter].

A.23:  But I know I had, I had found myself ((about)), I don't know, two years ago
in the, in a situation where I, I literally had more magazines coming in than
I could read.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  And I thought this is crazy.  So #I,#

B.26:  #You# know, it's not so bad if they're monthly publications, but like
NEWSWEEK, which I really enjoy --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- um, comes out every week #and,#

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  so it's really hard to keep up with.

A.31:  [Lipsmack]  Well, I, I took TIME #for,#

B.32:  #Uh-huh.#

A.33:  I guess ten years [breathing] and I enjoyed it and it, you know, it has
just, you know, a wealth of information.  I mean, it's ((therefore)) similar
to NEWSWEEK, but whenever I got to the point that I, I just finally said this
is just insane, because I had so many magazines.

B.34:  #Yeah.#

A.35:  #I# let them all lapse.  And then, once they were all gone, and of course,
that took a while.  I didn't realize how much I had paid up on some of them.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  And, uh, then I decided well, I, you know, VANITY FAIR offered me a special
thing to [breathing] come back at a reduced rate, you know.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  And then HARPER'S did and so I, you know, little by little I've, I've, you
know, subscribed to a few more again.

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  But, uh, I take the newspaper every day.

B.42:  Uh-huh [noise].

A.43:  So I've got plenty of reading #material.#

B.44:  #[Laughter]# Yeah [laughter].  Well, we get the newspaper on the weekends
#and,#

A.45:  #Yeah.#

B.46:  that seems to be enough #[laughter].#

A.47:  #Yeah,# yeah.

B.48:  Because we'll just turn on the news otherwise and see, see what the latest
is #[laughter].#

A.49:  #Well,# you sound, though, kind of like me, though.  But I mean, it's, I'm,
I have [breathing] always plenty of reading material around my house.

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  And when I go to visit my brother and sister-in-law in Austin, it drives me
crazy, because I, I always have to be sure and put something in my suitcase to
read, because honestly, I wonder, these people don't ever read.

B.52:  Oh, is that right?

A.53:  Yeah.  I mean, their house just, you know, it's just, it's, it's appalling
to me, they have nothing to read.

B.54:  Well, maybe that's what you ought to get them for Christmas #[laughter].#

A.55:  #Yeah, really.  Well, actually,# I think one year several years ago I did
give them a, a subscription to TIME --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and they never said a word about it #you know,#

B.58:  #Oh,# really #((like)).#

A.59:  #And so# I thought well, maybe they #(( )).#

B.60:  #They're# not into that.

A.61:  Maybe they weren't into it, #you know.#

B.62:  #Yeah.#

A.63:  That's fine, but it's just it's so different than [breathing] (( )).  I
just, I require reading material.

B.64:  #Right.#

A.65:  #That's# all there is to it.

B.66:  Right, yeah.  Um, you know, one thing I hate, I don't know if this is
really on the subject, but when they call you, the different places call 
you --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- to sign up at this, you know, and they try to give you this big bargain,
and, and you're like no, we already subscribe to enough magazines at the time
#and,#

A.69:  #Uh-huh.#

B.70:  So.

A.71:  Yeah, well, I, um, [throat_clearing] you know, I had, as a matter of fact,
the VANITY FAIR, whenever I let it lapse --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- [Breathing] they had sent me all these, you know, final notice things,
and I just, you know, didn't send them back in.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  And so finally, once I did decide to subscribe again, [lipsmack] I sent in
a, a thing that said hey, you know, I mean it was whatever the, the, uh,
subscription rate was --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- I think like fifteen dollars --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- and about a month later I got a thing in the mail saying well, hey, as a
former subscriber, you can now get it for twelve.

B.80:  Oh.

A.81:  And they had a one eight hundred number.  I called up and I said hey, I
want three bucks back.

B.82:  Right #[laughter].#

A.83:  #So they# extended, they said they were going to extend my subscription for
three months.

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  But they're pretty competitive.

B.86:  Yeah, yeah.  But, um, I find at times [lipsmack] I have numerous magazines
piled up [laughter] and I'll just sit down, you know, one weekend or something
and try to catch up on them.

A.87:  #Yeah.#

B.88:  #But# I mean I, you know, I enjoy it.  I guess, you know, um, as far as
comparing that to other media, it's so much easier to listen to either the
radio or to watch T V to listen, I mean to know what's going on, rather than
to read an article.

A.89:  Oh, #it is.#

B.90:  #in a# magazine.

A.91:  It is.   

B.92:  #[Laughter].#

A.93:  #And it just,# but at the same time [breathing] you can [throat_clearing]
you can get information.  I mean there, there, the variety, and you can get
#different,#

B.94:  #Right.#

A.95:  types of information [breathing].

B.96:  Right.

A.97:  And, and, you know, television is, is geared so much to [breathing] the
average Joe Blow, and quite frankly, I mean there, there are items of interest
to me that you'll never find on television.

B.98:  Exactly, yeah.  That's true.  The other thing is, um, some magazines,
