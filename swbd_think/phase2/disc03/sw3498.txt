=======================================================================

A.1:  All right.  This is my opinion.  I, I'm still a student right now and I'm
actually studying in elementary education.  I think there are quite a few
problems with the school systems today.

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  Uh, more than anything I just believe that as students we're taught to
learn what the teacher wants instead of actually, uh, gaining a further
vantage point.  And so it's, basically we're taught to be mediocre in what we
learn.

B.4:  Yeah [throat_clearing], uh, I'm also an education major [throat_clearing].
I'm still in school and, uh, but I want to go into teaching Special Ed.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And, uh, I think there is a lot of problems in that area.  And I think
there is problems all over with the education system --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- whether it be, uh, [noise] elementary, you know, or even colleges, you
know, have their flaws, but [throat_clearing] especially in the learning
disabilities because, uh, a lot of times, you know, teachers think, oh, this
kid is dumb, and, you know, they h-, just, not too many people have knowledge,
you know --

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  -- about [throat_clearing] this area of, uh, type of kids, you know,
because there are going to become new and, and they are starting to find out
more research about, uh, this type of learning.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  And so,

A.13:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think that's really a, a really neat field.
I, uh, work right now in a special center for abused children and for some of
the learning disabled.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  And it's incredible how they can learn quickly if you just find what's
right for them.

B.16:  That's right.  

A.17:  And I think, like you said, at least in my opinion, I think they put a lot
of restrictions on teachers of how they can teach them, you know.

B.18:  That's right, they're, they hire teachers who aren't even qualified to
teach those kind of kids and they burn out so fast, they don't want to teach
them.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  And there is not enough teachers who want to do that [throat_clearing], and
they are starting to find out, you know, oh, this kid might have a learning
disability.  They test them and find out that they do and then, it's just a
growing field, because more and more kids are being tested into that.

A.21:  I think it's real interesting, too.  I think along with the special
children, I have a friend who is gifted --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- and in school he did terrible his, all his years because there was no
one who ever challenged him or who ever found what exactly was what he needed
in terms of learning.

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  And I think, again, it kind of goes back to the same thing of, you know,
being mediocre in everything that we do.

B.26:  Right, and, like, everybody, not just people with problems, uh, learn
differently.  I mean, you know, one teacher can go out and learn how to teach,
but [throat_clearing] they only know one way.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  And a kid might have [throat_clearing] problems, you know, learn that,
comprehending, well --

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  -- what does that mean, I think it's, I think more teachers should, uh,
find different ways, be creative on their teaching.

A.31:  Well, I think you're absolutely correct.  

B.32:  So,

A.33:  You know, I think personally, like you said, it, it has more to do with the
teachers coming out of their shell and not being afraid to make mistakes and
saying, you know, hey, I'm going to try this.  If it works, great, if it
doesn't, I apologize.

B.34:  Right, uh-huh.  

A.35:  And I, I found in my own schooling that when the teachers made that special
effort to, to make the class exciting, to make it different, to, to challenge
my intellect or to, to bring about a different method of teaching, I was a lot
more interested in learning.

B.36:  Yeah, exactly. 

A.37:  What do you think about the grading systems and, and how those work?

B.38:  [Throat_clearing] The grad-, -- 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  -- grading system?  Uh, well, uh, I think, uh, well, in a sense, it's
probably too easy, but if it wasn't --

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  -- uh, these kids, you know, I mean, nowadays a lot of kids they just, you
know, don't try.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  They don't get the grades that they could.  

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  And, uh, [lipsmack] I don't, I don't,  

A.47:  Do you think there is too much focus on grade and s-, grades instead of
learning?

B.48:  Yeah, I think, well, the field I want to go into, grades to me doesn't mean
much.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  It doesn't tell you how intelligent you are, how bright you are.

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  You know, uh, because I know somebody who is very bright and very
intelligent, but just doesn't get the grades and that's just because they have
a learning disability.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  Uh, so, yeah, I think you have a good point there where they don't focus
enough on, uh --

A.55:  Um.  

B.56:  -- [Lipsmack] g-, how they learn and what they are learning. 

A.57:  Right.  

B.58:  You know, not on the grade.  

A.59:  Yeah, and I think, at least as, me, as a college student, I have a really
hard time because you know they, when you go out for a job or whatever, they
are going to focus on your grades and I think, again, that a lot of school
problems are more society problems where they are not looking at the
individuals, as much as they are just the whole overall picture.

B.60:  Right.  

A.61:  And you know, like you said, I, I like the point you brought up that, that
you said really, it needs to be individualized.

B.62:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

A.63:  And I think as that happens more that the schooling will become better.

B.64:  Right, and that's hard with a, a large class, you know.  With thirty kids,
you can't give them all your full attention but,

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  And I, I wish there was a way.  I'm not sure that [throat_clearing],
