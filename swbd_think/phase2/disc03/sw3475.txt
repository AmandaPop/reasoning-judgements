=======================================================================

A.1:   Well, what do you like to read?  

B.2:   Uh, I read about just anything that I can get my hands on.  

A.3:   You sound like me.  

B.4:   [Laughter]. 

A.5:   If it's printed, I'll read it.  

B.6:   Exactly.  

A.7:   Yeah, it's amazing to me the people that, uh, I've, I've got
a brother and sister-in-law that, uh, like, whenever I go to visit
them, I'll always have to be sure to carry a book with me
[laughter],  

B.8:   [Laughter]. 

A.9:   because there's nothing to read in their house and I go
crazy.  

B.10:   [Laughter] Yeah, I pretty much carry my own reading material,
too.  I mean, I'll, uh, I'll be walking to work, I mean walking to
the elevator to work and I'll be reading a book on the way up in
the elevator -- 

A.11:   Yeah.  

B.12:   -- and everybody laughs at me.  

A.13:   Yeah, well I, I went to the library yesterday looking around
and I found this, uh, new book by P J O'Rourke -- 

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   -- called uh, uh, PARLIAMENT OF HORRORS, and it's about, uh,
it's his alone humorous attempts, attempts to explain the entire
U S government and it's really cute [laughter].  

B.16:   Um.  

A.17:   But, anyway, he wrote for ROLLING STONE magazine for years and
years.  I think he still does.  

B.18:   Uh-huh.  Is it a, is it a satire, or,  

A.19:   It is very much a satire.  

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   Yeah.  

B.22:   Well, I, like I said, I, I, I think, gosh, I can't remember
the last book I bought, but I've read so many and any book, my
mother usually has a stack at her house so I'll go and pick up one
over there, or several actually and just get through them one by
one.  Mostly I like, I don't know, I suppose [breathing] mystery
or history, true history.  

A.23:   Yeah.  

B.24:   That type of thing.  

A.25:   Most ladies do like mysteries a lot.  

B.26:   Yeah.  

A.27:   I have, I have a friend, too, is a voracious history buff.  

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   She just, she reads one history book after another and, and I
was telling her about the library here in Houston that has, uh, one
particular library that has all the mysteries arranged in one area. 
Uh, and then another one that, while they're not arranged in one
area, they do, they have question marks on the covers -- 

B.30:   Uh-huh.  

A.31:   -- to indicate that they're mysteries, and she said, oh, that
sounds like heaven to her so she wouldn't have to,  

B.32:   [Laughter]. 

A.33:   have to look for them.  

B.34:   That's true [laughter].  No, I can't say that I've been to the
library lately.  I've found quite a bit, I mean, I'm either reading
a newspaper, a magazine, or like I said anything I can get my hands
on.  

A.35:   Yeah, the only problem that I've got now [throat_clearing] is
that I, I take a daily paper and then I've got, oh, I don't know,
four or five magazines coming in and then, of course, I've always,
usually I'm in the middle of two or three different books at the
same time.  

B.36:   Exactly.  

A.37:   And I've found lately that, uh, that I, I feel, for some
reason I feel kind of bad about it, but, I'm not able to get
through the newspaper.  I mean, and I -- 

B.38:   Uh-huh.  

A.39:   -- and, and then if I'm not finished with it, I don't want to
throw it away and then all of a sudden it's the next day and then
it's the next day.  My kitchen counter is covered with m-,
newspapers, so I finally just, you know, make a run to the
dumpster.  

B.40:   Yeah.  

A.41:   But,  

B.42:   I, uh, I, well, I end up just picking out key sections and
then reading those --

A.43:   Yeah.

B.44:   -- and the rest of it, if I get to it, fine, if not,   

A.45:   Yeah, the only, really the only, the only day that I just, uh,
devour it cover to cover is on Sunday, but that's sort of a ritual
with me.  

B.46:   Uh-huh.  

A.47:   Get the coffee and a bran muffin and the newspaper and the,
turn on the stereo and I'm just, I'm, I'm set for about an hour.  

B.48:   [Laughter]  An hour, is that all [laughter]?  

A.49:   Well, maybe a little more.  At least an hour.  At least an
hour.  

B.50:   Yeah.  Well, I know my dad gets, bo-, I mean he gets the two
Dallas papers here and he, he sits down for at least about three,
so,   

A.51:   Yeah.  

B.52:   Me, I don't know, I don't, I don't sit, specifically sit down
on Sundays to read the Sunday papers, sometimes I don't get to it
till like Wednesday [laughter].  

A.53:   [Laughter] Yeah -- 

B.54:   But, I still read it.  

A.55:   -- well that's the good thing about the Sunday paper.  They
have so many articles that aren't necessarily, uh, you know, you
don't feel like they're old if you don't get to them -- 

B.56:   Exactly.  

A.57:   -- that, on that one day.  

B.58:   Exactly.  

A.59:   Well, I, uh, I don't know, I had bought books for years and
years and, uh, the last time I moved when I was transferred to
Houston, I, uh, filled up one big closet with books because where
I live now doesn't have a bookshelf -- 

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   -- doesn't have, doesn't have the book shelves that I had in
Dallas where I moved from.  And, uh, I don't know, see, I've just,
I've got such, so many books and moving them was such a pain that
I've really stopped buying so many and I started going to the
library again, which I hadn't done in fifteen years.  

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   You know, and it was kind of like an awakening.  I found, you
know, gosh this is free, it's amazing [laughter] so,   

B.64:   Yeah.  

A.65:   But I've enjoyed it, and I,  

B.66:   It's, it's really a much better idea.  It's a bit inconvenient
for me, but I've always told myself I'd do that because, I don't
know, I get the books and then after I read them, if I really like
them, I'll keep them, but if not, you know, it's, it's wasted space
for me, so -- 

A.67:   Yeah.  

B.68:   -- I end up giving them away.  

A.69:   Yeah, but, uh, I've got, I'm kind of s-, surrounded.  I've got
three different libraries that are within, oh, I don't know, it's,
uh, [lipsmack] I guess the furthest one away is maybe two miles. 

B.70:   Oh, that's good.  

A.71:   One of them only about a half mile away, the other one is
about a mile and a half and, and one in particular stays open till,
uh, nine o'clock -- 

B.72:   Um.  

A.73:   -- Monday through Friday, so, it's, you know, it's great.  And
that makes it, you know, if it were just regular hours, then it
would be difficult because I'm [breathing] usually work pretty
late at the office.  

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   But, uh, [lipsmack] anyway, that's, uh, I still like to go to
the bookstores and browse around, but, uh,   

B.76:   Well, I, I'll read the reviews.  

A.77:   Uh-huh.  

B.78:   And just stay in,
