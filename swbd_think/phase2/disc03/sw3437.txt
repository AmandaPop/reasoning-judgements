==========================================================================

A.1:  Camping, um, I've been to several different kinds of camping when I, I've
been to a girls camp where we slept, you know, in tents and there were a bunch
of girls and cooked over the fire and I've also, uh, been camping in a camper
trailer or, or on a, uh, with a truck and a, and a camper.  Um, when I was
younger I really enjoyed going in the, in the, the trailer.  I didn't realize
until I was older how much, [laughter] how much work there was involved for
the, for the parents of the camping.

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  Um, are you ha-, what kind of camping have you #participated in?#

B.4:  #Uh,# I'm a boy scout leader so we, we go camping every month. 

A.5:  Oh [child].

B.6:  (( )) just, you know, tent camping of, I never really camped in, you know,
in a motor home or a trailer.

A.7:  Oh.  

B.8:  It's always been in a tent.  

A.9:  So when you go, do you go to, to designated camping sites or just up in the
mountains or, well,

B.10:  #Just, no, no,#

A.11:  #no# mountains,

B.12:  #the,#

A.13:  #there.# 

B.14:  the boy scouts have their own, you know, ranches --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- that they own and they've got park rangers that run them. 

A.17:  Oh.  

B.18:  And that, you know, they've got campsites set up and latrines and water,
((you know,)) for the boys.

A.19:  Oh.  So y-, you don't really have to rough it too bad, [laughter] huh?

B.20:  No, we, we bring our own cooking gear, you know, the, the boys --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- split them up in patrols, and they cook their own food and stuff.

A.23:  Oh, do you, do you cook over an open fire or do you have the little camp
stoves?

B.24:  Uh, we, we usually cook over an open fire.  We've, we've got camp stoves
in, you know, in case it's, if it's too wet or something.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Oh, 

B.26:  {Very faint} #And,#

A.27:  #have# you ever done Dutch oven cooking while you're camping? 

B.28:  Uh, yes.  We, we've cooked stews and cobblers and biscuits and,

A.29:  Oh.  

B.30:  In fact, every, every time I go I end up having to cook biscuits for
breakfast in a Dutch oven, so [laughter].

A.31:  Oh, [laughter] you must be an expert, huh?  [Laughter].  Oh, uh,

B.32:  Well, [laughter] just a lot of practice.  

A.33:  Oh, yeah, I've had, um, we go, my family once a year goes up to the, in the
mountains around here it's to a place called Cup River and, and camp out with
the family and also a family reunion type thing and my uncle makes, uh,
potatoes and onions in the, in the, in the Dutch ovens and they are sure good.
I, so I don't know how to cook that way but it's,

B.34:  #Yeah, we# -- 

A.35:  #I've liked# the things I've tasted.  

B.36:  -- we do that for breakfast sometimes [laughter].

A.37:  Oh, do you set up your own, you take your own tents you say and,

B.38:  Uh, yeah, the, the boy scout troop owns enough, has enough tents for the
boys, you know, two man tents.  One for each boy.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  And then a couple leaders have big tents that most of the adults, you know,
sleep together in them.

A.41:  Oh.  

B.42:  And some, sometimes we rough it.  We went, there's a lake called Lake
Texoma on a Texas-Oklahoma border --

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  -- and we took the boys backpacking there that they didn't have any, you
know, facilities or anything.  And we each,

A.45:  #Oh.# 

B.46:  #we# packed in our tents, we packed in our own groceries, our own water,
and stuff.

A.47:  Oh, wow. 

B.48:  #And boy,#

A.49:  #Oh, wow so# you have to take everything you need and do they, did you just
find a place that you liked and decided to set up camp there or,

B.50:  It's a, it's a state park -- 

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- so we just, you know, had to check with the ranger and tell him where we
was going.  We had a map and all.

A.53:  Oh.  

B.54:  We had the boys, the boys hiked in, I guess about five miles --

A.55:  Oh, wow.  

B.56:  -- and we set up camp and, you know, spent a night.  

A.57:  Uh-huh.  Do the boys like that kind of better or do they like to just go
where it's close and,

B.58:  #Oh they, they seem to,# 

A.59:  #the facilities there,# 

B.60:  like the roughing because they want to go again next month.  

A.61:  Oh [laughter].  Next month in December?   

B.62:  #Yeah.# 

A.63:  #Oh.# I keep forgetting you are, it's not as cold there as it is here
[laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter] No, it's,  

A.65:  Oh, well, I, when I was a fourth year, uh, girl scout camper we, we hiked
into a spot and that was, um, by a lake and it was beautiful.  And I almost
think that's, you feel more rewarded when you, when you do it that way than
when you drive in with the other stuff.  It is a lot more work though
[laughter].

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  It takes a lot more.  So did you camp when you were growing up or is this
something you've just done as #a result?#

B.68:  #I,# I was in scouts as a kid so, you know, I've gotten, when you camp with
kids I've gotten used to it and,

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  Uh, my wife was from Mississippi out in the country and she's, her family
camps, they, you know, they, they spend a week on a lake fishing and stuff.

A.71:  Oh.  

B.72:  In fact, a few years ago we, on Labor Day weekend we went into the Arbuckle
Mountains in Oklahoma.

A.73:  Oh.  

B.74:  Took three days, we camped at a different site each day.  

A.75:  Oh, how nice.  

B.76:  And that was enjoyable.  

A.77:  Boy that sounds like it.  Sounds like it was a, a nice trip.  Huh.  I,
yeah, I have lots of good memories when we always used to take a week in the
summer, my family, and have lots of good memories of sitting around the
campfire and marshmallows and ghost stories,
