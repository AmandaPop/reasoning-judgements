A.1:   What kind of books do you like best?  

B.2:   Well, I alternate between Danielle Steele [laughter] is one of
my very favorites and, uh, then I try to go into one of the self
improvement books.  Uh, we, we take books every once in a while in
our Sunday school class and go through them.  Uh, I love Scott Peck
and his ROAD LESS TRAVELED.  

A.3:   Huh, yeah, I've heard of that one.  I -- 

B.4:   Oh, it is --  

A.5:   -- don't think I've read it.  

B.6:   -- it is wonderful.  I, I thoroughly enjoyed that.  What do you
read?  

A.7:   Well, uh, I'm a Tom Clancy fan.  

B.8:   Okay.  

A.9:   And I read, I just finished a book on Novelle Netware, uh,
that's computer stuff.  I do a lot -- 

B.10:   Oh, yes.  

A.11:   -- of computer reading and, uh, I'm just finishing another one
up on, uh, statistical sampling, so, I do more work kind of related
reading than, uh, just for enjoyment.  

B.12:   I, I try to keep a book going all the time.  Uh, I try to read
when I first wake up in the morning and then before I go to sleep. 
So I probably get, oh, thirty to fifty pages a day read.   

A.13:   Well, that's pretty good.  

B.14:   And I just, you know, I don't feel like, in fact this morning,
I was almost late for work because I'm almost at the end of this
book and I didn't want to put it down [laughter].  

A.15:   [Laughter] Oh, I've had them like that before, too.  

B.16:   But I like, I like mysteries.  

A.17:   Mysteries.  Any particular writer?  

B.18:   Uh, yes, I like, uh, uh, oh, I'm drawing a blank.  Uh, he
wrote the, uh, BOURNE ULTIMATUM.  

A.19:   Ludwig, Lud-,  

B.20:   Ludwig, yes.

A.21:   Yes.

B.22:   And, uh, I like Jeffrey Archer. 

A.23:   What does he r-, write?  

B.24:   He is an English author who writes some mystery.  Uh, well, I
guess they're, they're a type of mystery.  They're usually some p-,
he's a ex-lawyer so, or, he, he's a lawyer who no longer practices,
but -- 

A.25:   Oh. 

B.26:   -- his are all, have some part of the law, uh, enveloped in
them.  

A.27:   So, you kind of learn something as well as en-, enjoy
yourself.  

B.28:   Right, and then, uh, the new author that came out with, uh,
oh, the one that, uh, Harrison Ford starred in.  

A.29:   RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stuff.  

B.30:   No, no, it was -- 

A.31:   Oh. 

B.32:   -- the, uh, [breathing] it's late, I'm tired, so [laughter]
I'm not -- 

A.33:   What,  

B.34:   -- thinking too well.  

A.35:   what time is it there, ten thirty?  

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   Uh, it's nine thirty here.  

B.38:   Oh, it's, uh, it was his first book.  It came, it was on the
top of the list, uh, he was a D A.  

A.39:   Uh, PRESUMED INNOCENT?  

B.40:   Yes.  

A.41:   Oh, I haven't seen the movie, uh, or n-, read the book but,   

B.42:   Okay, and then he's, he came out with the second one.  Uh, a
sequel to it.  

A.43:   Oh. 

B.44:   And both of those I've enjoyed real well.  But I, I like that. 
I love Danielle Steele and, and, you know, if I want to get a
fantasy and [laughter] -- 

A.45:   Is she --  

B.46:   -- get away from it all.  

A.47:   -- is she kind of racy?  

B.48:   No, no, she isn't at all.  

A.49:   Just feel good. 

B.50:   Her books, uh, you always cry.  

A.51:   Oh, really?  

B.52:   I mean, it's, it's always good for good tears.  

A.53:   [Laughter]. 

B.54:   Uh, one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women
is FINE THINGS, F I N E, THINGS.  

A.55:   M-, my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers.  

B.56:   Well, it's, it's one that's, you know, it's, it's always going
to make you have a good cry and you know it's going it turn out
good and you're going to be happy in the end [laughter].  

A.57:   Oh, well, that's nice.  

B.58:   And I said, you know, I don't want anything too real anymore. 
I have enough of that in my own life.  I want, I want happy,
fantasy like.  

A.59:   [Laughter] Yeah.  Uh, you mentioned Sunday school Ladonna.  

B.60:   Uh-huh.  

A.61:   Uh, do you, are you a BIBLE fan, too?  

B.62:   Uh, I, I do my share of it.  I, I certainly can't say that I
understand a lot of it.  

A.63:   Oh, yeah, but, uh, that's always a challenge.  So do you do,
my wife talks with other people,
