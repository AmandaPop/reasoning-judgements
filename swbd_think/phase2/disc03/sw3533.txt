A.1:  Okay, Miss Nancy, we should be in business now.

B.2:  #Good.#

A.3:  #Did# you hear the questions that the lady, uh, brought up?

B.4:  Yes.

A.5:  Such as how much time, well, I'll ask, how much time do you spend with your
children, and how many do you have?

@B.6:  We have two children, they're both grown and married and with, we have,
uh, our daughter has three sons, so we see them at least once a week, and we
see our son and his wife [breathing] uh, about every other week and, uh --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- we baby-sit quite frequently.  So we're a fairly close-knit family.
We're together a lot on special days and, uh, and of course, with the
holidays and everything.

A.9:  Well, you're very fortunate.  Uh, my [laughter] [breathing] my, uh, I have
two girls and a son,

B.10:  #Uh-huh.#

A.11:  #And# my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam, Holland.

B.12:  Oh.

A.13:  #She [laughter],# 

B.14:  #[Laughter].#

A.15:  Her husband builds pianos, so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them,
as much as I'd like to.

B.16:  Oh, #yes.#

A.17:  #Because# we've, we, one thing we do have together is we're both musicians.
I play in several symphony orchestras and,

B.18:  #Uh-huh.#

A.19:  #she is# a, a, a concert, uh, harpsichordist.

B.20:  Oh.

A.21:  And travels around a good bit in Europe.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  And, uh, her husband builds forte pianos, which are harpsichord size
#pianos.#

B.24:  #Pianos,# uh-huh.

A.25:  And, uh, that's why they're over there.  And then I have a, a son who lives
in, uh, [lipsmack] Warrington, Pennsylvania.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  And I get to see him maybe once every three months.  So I really, we've
lost, you know, I'd like to have an everyday contact with children, uh, as
well as you do, for that matter, and my ((young)), my youngest daughter lives
in New Jersey, and so #they,#

B.28:  #Oh,# you don't get to see any of #yours very often.#

A.29:  #I don't hardly# get to see any of them.  She works in these, um,
[lipsmack] Trump type casinos, she and her husband #both do.  They work,# --

B.30:  #Yes, uh-huh.#

A.31:  -- uh, they're really both, um [lipsmack] play, people who play on stage --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- and, uh, they're running lights right now and audio and ((that thing))
#for,#

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#

A.35:  plays and things that go on.  But anyhow [breathing] uh, what do you, what
activities do you do with your children when you are together?

B.36:  Oh, most the #time,#

A.37:  #[Cough].#

B.38:  well, right now it's football season, and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan,
as is our husband, so, my husband, so she watches that and I play with the
grandchildren [laughter].

A.39:  #[Laughter].#

B.40:  #I enjoy the# grandchildren.  But, now, like last weekend, um, there's the
Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas, and it ends,

A.41:  #Oh.#

B.42:  #uh,# in January, so she and, and the three boys and my husband and I went
over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit and this #Sunday,#

A.43:  #The Soviet# space #exhibit?#

B.44:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.45:  #My goodness.#

B.46:  #Yeah it's,#

A.47:  I am surprised they would bring anything over here.

B.48:  Oh, it's been here for quite, uh, some time.  I think it came here in
either September or October #and,#

A.49:  #Uh-huh.#

B.50:  it's very interesting, #very interesting,#

A.51:  #I'll bet.#

B.52:  and it's been very well done [breathing].  Uh, and this, uh, next Sunday
they're coming over after the Cowboy game and, #uh,#

A.53:  #Uh-huh.#

B.54:  uh, we're going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a
Santa's village.  And, uh, then when our son's over, we have a pool, and he
and his wife come and a lot of their friends, and we have cookouts on Sunday
#uh,#

A.55:  #Well,# that sounds like you have #really,# --

B.56:  #And, uh# --

A.57:  -- wonderful activities that --

B.58:  -- we, we do a lot with --

A.59:  -- keep you together.

B.60:  -- with our kids, and we --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- we always have.  We've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were
younger.  Uh, we're very family oriented.  We, um,

A.63:  Well, #that's wonderful.#

B.64:  #we like# being with our kids, and the kids seem to enjoy being with us,
and their friends enjoy being with us.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  So which that keeps us very, very young, with all these young people
passing in and out and #eating,#

A.67:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.68:  and #seems like I've,# 

A.69:  #The only# problem is, it keeps you pretty busy, keeping everything going,
doesn't it?

B.70:  Well, it does #[laughter].#

A.71:  #[Laughter].#

B.72:  I'm worried about Christmas.  Christmas Eve they all pass through, and then
they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night, so #that,#

A.73:  #Uh-huh.#

B.74:  we open our presents on Christmas day [breathing] --

A.75:  Beautiful.

B.76:  -- and they go out to the other, you know, the in-laws in between some of
this, but they're #all,#

A.77:  #Uh-huh.#

B.78:  with us, and, uh, then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other
in-laws and things, so we see a lot of them.  But we enjoy Christmas Eve
night, because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock, and we open
presents about five o'clock #Christmas,# 

A.79:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.80:  morning, and, you know, and, uh, #then,#

A.81:  #Uh-huh.#

B.82:  I go to the kitchen and cook, and my sister and, and her husband are coming
down, so there's going to be eleven of us #for Christmas.#

A.83:  #That's great.# There's a, the question now to ask, is it difficult to find
time, and you seem to be making out all right.

B.84:  Yeah.  Sometimes I'm a little exhausted #[laughter].#

A.85:  #[Laughter] Well, tell me, wh-,# what do you think of, uh, of the current
trends of how other people spend time with their children #and so forth?#

B.86:  #Oh, I,# I think the trends are going back to spending more time with
families.

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  I think parents are definitely, uh, spending more and more time.  I don't
think they're leaving them with baby-sitters, you know.  I think, I think
family quality time is becoming much more important than it was #there# --

A.89:  #Yes.#

B.90:  -- for about, uh, I don't know, eight or nine years.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a
deal.  Parents kind of went and did their thing, kids did their thing.

A.93:  Well, that's #no,#

B.94:  #And, uh,# 

A.95:  that's exactly what I was going to say.  Of, of course, I find now that I
spend more time with my grandchildren in --

B.96:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.97:  -- detail.  I know more about them and watch their growth and how they
improve and, and learn much more so than my own kids.  When, when your own
children are growing up, you just take them for granted and you go ahead and
do your thing and,
