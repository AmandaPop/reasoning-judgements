=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, um, since I'm in college, uh, I mean, uh, I haven't seen that much
change [laughter].

B.2:  [Laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter] I'm kind of young still, I don't know how much it changed in
the last, uh, twenty years anyway.  But, I don't know.  Do you, do you have an
idea of, of how much.

B.4:  No, I'm not that old either [laughter].

A.5:  [Laughter] Uh-huh.

B.6:  I'm only twenty-nine.

A.7:  Oh, okay.  

B.8:  So, social changes [laughter] aren't that much for me either.

A.9:  Yeah, right.  Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the
disco days and maybe that's changed a lot.  Uh --

B.10:  Well, yeah, that.

A.11:  -- the way, the way people dress and, uh.

B.12:  I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.

A.13:  More lax?

B.14:  Uh-huh, relaxed --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and laid back and stuff and.

A.17:  Maybe a people are a little o-, more open-minded than maybe they used to
be.

B.18:  I think so.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  I think so, and a lot, I think people are, are used to now saying what's,
what's on their minds more --

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  -- more up front --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- than they used to be.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now
like, you know, Pro-Life and, and Pro-, uh, Choice in, in the special interest
groups maybe --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- um, like amnesty.  Uh, yeah, maybe people are a little, a little more,
uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.

B.28:  Yeah, I think so.  I think women have come out more --

A.29:  Oh, yeah.

B.30:  -- too, on, on like child abuse --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- and, and the wife beatings, and --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and like you said, pro cho-, pro-choice and --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- whatnot.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  Right.

B.38:  I think that's become more out-, outstanding than it used to be where
women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying
something.

A.39:  Right.  Just wasn't socially acceptable.  

B.40:  No, huh-uh.

A.41:  Yeah.  Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for
the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships
has changed, you know, and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have
to worry about AIDS and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming
more aware, more, more afraid of --

B.42:  Right.

A.43:  -- relationships.

B.44:  Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and
sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- and all that stuff, and, you know, we didn't have to talk about, well
basically her thing was just don't do it, you know --

A.47:  Ri-, right.  Yeah.

B.48:  -- but, I'm not, I'm not naive,

A.49:  [Laughter].

B.50:  to think that my children are not going to not do it. 

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  It wasn't that long that I was that young.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  And I've got a ten year old, and, you know, he thought, he knows about
condoms, and --

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  -- and he knows about AIDS, and --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- it's just different things you have to talk to them about now --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.

A.61:  Right.  It used to be that we were, th-, that we were trying to protect
morality.  Now it's we're protecting our lives.  It's a --
 
B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- it's a much different, we have, you know, you can't just, just hope for
abstinence.

B.64:  No, I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part.  I mean --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- that's, sex is rampant, and it always will be, and --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders,
which is what my son is --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  I mean, the boys are very open --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around --

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  -- basically, is boys, but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't
talk about until he was in college --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- you know, and, and they sit down and they look at you right in the face
and they expect a truthful answer.

A.79:  That's right.

B.80:  You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers --

A.81:  [Laughter] Yeah.

B.82:  -- and stuff.  They, they, that just does not go.

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know [laughter].

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  But it, it's interesting, listening to them.  I think, I think the social
changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- than I do with like our generation.

A.89:  Right, right.  Yeah, I, I, I imagine you're right.  I, I teach swim lessons
a lot, and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know,
they're, they're open about, well, you know, kids are a lot more educated now
than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age --

B.90:  Yeah, I do too.

A.91:  -- um, about a lot of things.  You know, besides what, besides what they
learn, uh, from, from our social environment is, uh, their education is just
amazing.  Kids are, kids are learning, uh, you know, their math is just, every
year, uh, algebra goes down a grade, you know, and, and, uh, students learn it
earlier.

B.92:  I know, well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,
