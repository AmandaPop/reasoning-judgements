=========================================================================

A.1:  So, what did you have done to your car last?  

B.2:  Well, in fact, just recently, we're waiting to get it fixed right now.
It's, uh, my wife one day when it was kind of a windy day, she opened the door
and it kind of blew it all the way back, kind of bent it back up against the
front bumper there and so we're try-, it, it, uh, broke the, uh, the hinge
that holds the door onto the car --

A.3:  Oh. 

B.4:  -- and so it has to be rewelded and everything.  So, uh, we're waiting to
get that re-, you know, repaired and they have to weld it and touch up some of
the paint and everything.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And, uh, as for maintenance and stuff that I do, I, I kind of don't, don't
do any my, on, on my own.  I, other than waxing the car and keeping it clean,
but usually, I go to like Jiffy Lube and have them do the, uh, oil change and
the lubrication and such.

A.7:  Yeah, that's really dirty work, isn't it?  

B.8:  Yeah [laughter].  How about you?  

A.9:  Oh, I'm a single woman, so I have most of mine done and I, my car died
[laughter] this year so, 

B.10:  Oh, did it?  

A.11:  And I went down and priced the new cars and there was no way I could afford
a new car.

B.12:  Right.  

A.13:  So, I just, I went and had mine rebuilt.  I had a rebuilt engine put in it,
and the week after that the transmission went out --

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  -- so I had to put a t-, transmission in it.  But, it's running pretty good
now after I had all that done.

B.16:  Gosh, what kind is it?  

A.17:  It's a Lincoln.  

B.18:  Um, ours is a, uh, Voyager, Plymouth Voyager.  

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  So, and I really like that.  

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  But that's about it, I mean, I don't do, I used to, I used to have a, uh,
when I was single [laughter] and I had a, 

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  a, uh, a Mustang, a fas-, you know, an old Mustang, sixty-five, I used
to do everyth-, a lot of things.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  

B.26:  I would do all the oil changes and the tune-ups and, and, uh, you know,
making it fast and putting carburetors and everything like that on it and, uh,
I used to do all that, but since, since then, really no, since I got married,
actually.  And I just find it easier to go to one of these, uh, you know, fast
places, like Jiffy Lube or someplace like that.

A.27:  Is it that you don't have the time to work on it like you'd like to or --

B.28:  Yeah, that's, pretty much.  

A.29:  -- your tired of it after doing it for so many years?  

B.30:  No, it's actually, more like I don't have the time.  You go, because we
also have two kids, too, and, so --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- then I, you know, just trying to find time for them and then try to do
the car, too.  I just, you know, and the house and the yard and, you know,
everything else.  So,

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  So, usually I just, uh, try to make it as convenient as possible and go to
one of those kind of places.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  But,  

A.37:  Well, being a single person, I can't afford much, so I take mine to K-mart
and get the oil changed on it.

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  It's, I can get by pretty cheap on that, and -- 

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- then I have a friend that puts my plugs in it when I need new
spark plugs.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  So he does that for me and that's, that helps me a lot.  

B.44:  Oh, good, good deal.  

A.45:  So,  

B.46:  Well, I guess that's about it, huh?  

A.47:  Yeah, I need new, I'm putting new tires on it, now.  

B.48:  Oh, are you?  

A.49:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.50:  Oh, yeah, we did that, too.  In fact, that was, that was the one right
before this is, uh, we had to get some new tires in the back.  Evidently one
of the, uh, the right rear tire had one of the weights fall off it or
something.

A.51:  Um.  

B.52:  And so consequently got a, some kind of bubble in what they call, 

A.53:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.54:  out of round or something.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  And so you can hear it when you sit in the back, you know, the thump,
thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  And so we had to get a new one.  So that was a recent one, too.

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  And tires aren't cheap.  

A.61:  Well, car, car, that's, a car is never ending.  

B.62:  [Laughter] Yeah, right.  

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  It's always something, that's true.  

A.65:  That's right.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  And, uh, I tell my friend, when my, when I have car troubles, he says,
well, you just, you have to remember, it's just a machine.

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  It's not going to last forever.  

B.70:  That's right [laughter]. 

A.71:  [Laughter] I say, well, I want it to.  

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  I want it to last forever.  I put, I put, uh, two thousand dollars in it
and I want it to last.

B.74:  Yeah, you're right.  

A.75:  At least a little while.  

B.76:  [Laughter]. 

A.77:  Least another year.  

B.78:  Yeah [laughter].  

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  Well, well, that's about all I have for stories on the car.  

A.81:  Yeah, me, too.  

B.82:  [Laughter]. 

@@A.83:  Well, what, how old are your kids?  

B.84:  Uh, one's four and the other one's one.  

A.85:  Oh, well, they're just little bitty kids.  

B.86:  Yeah, so they take up a lot of time [laughter]. 

A.87:  Really, they do when they're little like that.  

B.88:  Sure do.  

A.89:  And are they a boy and a girl or,  

B.90:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.91:  Oh, well, that's, you're lucky.  

B.92:  Yeah, I know, we lucked out [laughter]. 

A.93:  How's the weather down there at Virginia Beach?  

B.94:  Very nice.  We've had a, quite a warm last few days.  In fact, it's been in
the, in the, well, sixty, sixty-seven to seventy.  So we've been really,
really good with the weather.  So,

A.95:  Well, it was in the seventies here today.  

B.96:  Is it?  

A.97:  And that's, that's really, I think that's unusual for Dallas. 

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  Because I think by now it's snowing and we're having i-, well last year,
I've only lived here for two years, but last year at this time, there was, we
were having snow and ice storms, and, I, I just, I can't, it's, it's, uh,
sprinkling now.

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  I can't believe it's so warm out.  

B.102:  Gosh.  

A.103:  I mean it's, I know it's in the seventies.  

B.104:  Gosh.  

A.105:  But it's very humid because it's sprinkling.   

B.106:  Oh, really?  

A.107:  And today I wanted to ride the bicycle so bad and so that's what I did.  I
went down to the lake and rode the bicycle down at the lake.  It's cloudy and,
and the rain,
