========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what have you seen recently?  

B.2:  Oh my goodness, well, we don't go to the movie much, but we see quite a few
on T V.

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  Uh,

@A.5:  I asked you first because I couldn't think of,  

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  which one I've seen [laughter].  

B.8:  Well, let me see.  Uh, I guess the last one we saw at the movie was
probably PRETTY WOMAN [laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, I saw that.  

B.10:  Did you?  

A.11:  Uh-huh, it was cute.  

B.12:  Oh, I thought it was, too.  

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  I thought it was a real good movie.  Uh,

A.15:  The last one that I saw, I, I was thinking about whenever the, the voice
was, uh, what to think about, I rented last weekend this movie called a, THE
PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE that was made in nine, nineteen sixty-nine.
 
B.16:  Oh, uh-huh.  

A.17:  Starred Maggie Smith.  

B.18:  Oh I,

A.19:  And, who is really one of my all time favorite actresses.  

B.20:  Uh.  

A.21:  I don't know if you're, if you're familiar with her, but she's English and
she won the Academy Award for it --

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  -- that year.   

B.24:  Oh. 

A.25:  And, uh, I had just seen it, it was just a fluke that I happened to see it.
I was in college back then and I, and, and, and happened to see it and, I
remember thinking at the time when I was watching it, I was going, gosh, this
is, you know, even that, at that young, I said it, this is an Academy Award
performance, it has to be.

B.26:  Uh.  

A.27:  You know, and as it turned out she did win it that year.  

B.28:  That's great.  I remember that movie, and I remember that it was very good.
I don't remember if I saw it or not [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah, but, but I rented it, uh -- 

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- last weekend, and I can't, I, I don't know when I've enjoyed a movie,
uh, as much as I did that one.  It was just excellent.

B.32:  Oh. 

A.33:  So, uh,

B.34:  Uh, there is one that, uh, oh, let's see, my son likes with Tom Cruise.
It's a, an airplane movie, uh,

A.35:  TOP GUN. 

B.36:  TOP GUN. 

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  Yes.  

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  I thought that was a good movie.  

A.41:  Lots of rock them, sock them action in that.  

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  There is a lot of action, but I thought it was an excellent movie.

A.45:  Uh-huh, it was good.  

B.46:  And, let's see,

A.47:  Do you like any of the old one, have you seen, uh, [throat_clearing] a
friend of mine that, who lives in Denver was telling me about, uh, all these
old movies from the thirties and forties.

B.48:  Oh, well, now, I love all those [laughter].  

A.49:  Well, she told me about one that, uh, and I said, I said, gosh, I don't
think I've seen any of that.  And she said, well, rent this one.  She told me
it's called NOW VOYAGER with Bette Davis.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  G-, it was terrific.  

B.52:  Oh, well, that's good.  Uh, I remember that movie, I don't remember if I
saw it.  I saw everything I could see when I was younger [laughter].

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  And I remember a lot of them, and I love seeing them again.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  But, I don't think anything will ever top GONE WITH THE WIND. 

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  [Laughter]. 

A.59:  Well, you know, it was on television here in Houston, oh, about two weeks
ago.

B.60:  Yeah, we taped it.  

A.61:  Did you?  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  Yeah, it, it really is.  It's such a classic.  

B.64:  It really is.  

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  Anything, course, with Clark Gable I like.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And, uh, [breathing] oh, I don't know, let's, I like the older movies
because they were just so much more classier than what you see today.

A.69:  Well, they really were and, I, I don't know, it just seems that, you know,
there was so much thought that went in behind them and the, the dialogue was
good.  It wasn't, uh, uh, I mean, you know, I'll, I'll be honest with you, it
takes a fair amount to offend me --

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- and sometimes I go to these movies and they've got just this gratuitous,
uh, uh, you know, cursing in there --

B.72:  Oh. 

A.73:  -- just, and it seems like, you know, it, and they, somebody says, well, we
need to have the, you know, X number of, of dirty words --

B.74:  Right.  

A.75:  -- uh, in order to make it appealing.  

B.76:  Uh-huh.  

A.77:  And, and, and I don't know, it's, I'm always impressed with a, with a good
movie that, that can get by without it.  I saw, tell you what I saw, this,
this reminds me of it is CITY SLICKERS.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  Which, uh, was real cute.  

B.80:  Oh. 

A.81:  But, anyway, the thing that reminded me about it was real clean.

B.82:  Yeah.  Well, they could leave out a lot of that stuff and the movie would
be just as good.

A.83:  I agree, I agree.  

B.84:  Now, uh, let's see, I saw that DANCES WITH WOLVES.  

A.85:  That was good, wasn't it?  

B.86:  It was good, yes.  

A.87:  I didn't think it was just the end all and be all like the Academy 
thought --

B.88:  No.  

A.89:  -- you know.  

B.90:  I didn't think so and I told everybody that if I had made that movie I
could have made it shorter [laughter].

A.91:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.92:  Because there wasn't any need to go into that much detail.  

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  You know, show me one thing and I get the picture [laughter]. 

A.95:  [Laughter] Yeah, not over -- 

B.96:  No.  

A.97:  -- and over and over -- 

B.98:  Right.  

A.99:  -- and over.  

B.100:  But it had a good story and -- 

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  -- it was a little different, but it was a little too gross for me.

A.103:  Well, you know, that's it, my, my mother, whenever she and my, my dad went
to see it and I asked them, uh, how they liked it and my mother said, well, if
you like a lot of gore and blood, it's great.

B.104:  Yeah, right.  

A.105:  And [cough] you know, and I guess I'm partially immune to it, but
it didn't, it didn't,
