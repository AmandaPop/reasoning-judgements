========================================================================= 

A.1:  Okay, what do you think about, uh, the self insurance business?

@B.2:  Well, I watched something on T V a couple of months ago by, uh, General,
ex, uh, Surgeon General Koop.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And he talked about Canada's system and it appears to work fine for the
normal colds and things like that, but the expensive stuff, heart, uh,
operations and things, they have a managed scarcity.  And they said that in
Canada, there were as many heart, uh, trauma centers as there is in San
Francisco.  So in one city of, in America, there's as many, uh, hospitals that
are equipped to do hosp-, uh, heart operations as in the entire area of
Canada, and that's kind of spooky.

A.5:  Well, I, uh, I understand what you're saying, and there's probably some
truth to that.  I think that, uh, generally I don't welcome added government
responsibilities.  However, when a, anybody can't police their own profession,
it eventually leads to that, and I think the costs and the, uh, the way the
medical profession has, every year I, being in my own business, uh, in the
last six years, every year there's been at least minimum twenty-five percent
increase in health insurance costs, and I think eventually the number of
people that can afford health insurance, as, as it is now getting squeezed and
squeezed tighter.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  Uh, I think they're asking for it.  I, I think the medical profession is
just, just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over
{faint} #and, uh,#

B.8:  #Do you# think that it's just, uh, medical guys?  What about, you know, you
know how expensive new equipment and technology is.  That's where I think most
of the cost is coming.

A.9:  Well, I, I think a lot of it is, uh, I, I don't disagree totally with that,
but, uh, my wife this last summer, uh, when we were on vacation tore up her
knee, and, uh, uh, it was lig-, ligaments, uh, in her #knee,#

B.10:  #Uh-huh.#

A.11:  as it turned out, uh, she came back that, uh, we were out at Cape Hatteras
when this happened and, uh, she got home, and the leading orthopedic man, who
has handled football people for years and is as good as they come, I mean, he
knows knee problems #okay,#

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#

A.13:  I mean if anyone does, this guy knows it.  Well, she goes in, he says,
well, I think this is what it is, but, uh, you better go to the hospital and
have one of these M R I things.  A thousand dollars for this, uh, oh,
magnetic, uh, resonance imaging type thing.  And my wife said, well, do I need
that?  And he says, well, uh, you know, it, it'll help me diagnose this.  I
mean, uh, you know, I, I suggest you go have this thing.  Insurance won't pick
this up unless you're in the hospital.  #Now, a,#

B.14:  #Oh, great.#

A.15:  thousand, uh, uh, dollars for thirty-five minutes.  I mean, doctors
routinely send people in for anything.  Now, for years they didn't have this
and they solved these problems, and, you #know,#

B.16:  #((Yeah)).#

A.17:  I said to her, well, look, you know, if you feel you got to go, go, but I,
I think a thousand dollars, these guys, I don't know what it is, but
#there's,#

B.18:  #((Uh-huh)).#

A.19:  no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day.  And
even if they cost a hundred, two hundred, five hundred thousand dollars, at,
uh, roughly a thousand dollars every half hour, uh, that's ridiculous.  I, I
don't care what anyone says.  You know, the costs are not, it's a picture.  It
shouldn't cost more than thirty-five bucks for something like that, you know,
reasonableness.  But they aren't reasonable.  Fifty, a hundred dollars.  They
don't have to pay them back in three months time.

B.20:  No.  Yeah, I'll have to #agree,#

A.21:  #((You know)).#

B.22:  with you there, but there's another problem, and that's the, how litigious
our society is.  If the doctor makes a mistake, he can be sure that he's going
to be hauled into court.

A.23:  Well, I think that should be, that, that's a, another problem, but that's
part of our legalese problem.  And that, the government eventually will
address too [laughter] just, you know, because it's
out of control.  I, I agree with you.  You know, uh, I was on a
jury or I, I didn't make the jury, but there was a, 

B.24:  [Noise]. 

A.25:  deal where a doctor was going to be sued for malpractice on the death on
an infant.

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  Like it was three days after it was born, and he was the one that delivered
it.  And they got four attorneys, one guy out of Houston, he introduced
himself as snake so-and-so, and he says, well, anyone have trouble awarding
five million dollars, and I says, yeah, I got problems with [laughter].  I
mean, [laughter] you know, five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid
back, you know, I mean, as sorrowful as it is.  Uh, you know, if the doctor is
wrong, you know, he should be pulled from his license, but five million
dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it, you know, it, it
doesn't make logical sense to me, but, uh,

B.28:  No, it doesn't.

A.29:  Uh, that's,
