======================================================================

A.1:  Texas.

B.2:  Well, it's been beautiful this week, about, uh, seventy-two, something like
that.  It's gotten cooler today I think it's probably sixty and sunshiny.

A.3:  Boy, oh, boy.  That's nice and warm.

B.4:  Yea-, yeah it is a little bit warm right now.

A.5:  What's the humidity like?

B.6:  Um.  We don't have high humidity like Houston does.  It's probably, gee, I
don't know.

A.7:  Now you're in Dallas, is that what yo-,

B.8:  Dallas, uh-huh, where, we have a little bit of humidity, but not like --

A.9:  Not like,

B.10:  -- the southern part of the state does --

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  -- the north of the Red River so.

A.13:  So at the.

B.14:  Probably sixty, fifty, sixty.

A.15:  Pr-, pretty average for this time of the year.

B.16:  No, it's a little bit, oh, above average.  I would think a average now is
around sixty-five, sixty to sixty-five, something like that.

A.17:  Yes.

B.18:  I don't really know, but, uh, it's, it's, uh, warmer than it normally is
this time of year.

A.19:  Course don't you have some, uh, was it tornado watches not too long ago, or
hurricane or something.  Maybe it wasn't right in Dallas, but, uh --

B.20:  Oh, we.

A.21:  -- the flash, flash floods or,

B.22:  Oh, we always, lot of times we do have flooding when, because it's so much
cement here now the water doesn't have anywhere to go, because it's built up
so much.

A.23:  It's built up so much.

B.24:  Yeah, that, [laughter] I think they didn't think about the water when they,
they paved everything.

A.25:  Right, right --

B.26:  [Laughter] Don't, 

A.27:  -- don't think where it's going to have to go, huh.

B.28:  [Laughter] That's true, but, yeah, we have flash flooding, because, you
know, if we get four or five inches of rain we do have flooding, so, if it's
quickly, you know, real quick.

A.29:  If it comes pretty quickly, and,

B.30:  Yeah, that's true.  What, where are you in Idaho?

A.31:  Twin Falls.

B.32:  Twin Falls.

A.33:  That's kind of by, uh, have you heard of Sun Valley or Boise?

B.34:  I've been through Twin Falls --

A.35:  Oh, have you?

B.36:  -- #several years ago.#

A.37:  #Then you know where I am.#

B.38:  Yeah, it's beautiful out there.

A.39:  Yeah, it's kind of pretty.

B.40:  Yeah, it really is nice.

A.41:  We don't have, uh, any snow on the ground.

B.42:  What is your temperature?

A.43:  It's probably in the forties.

B.44:  Yeah, well, we're supposed to get, I think, to the thirties tonight.

A.45:  Are you?

B.46:  So, it's cooling up.  Makes you feel a little bit better.

A.47:  So that's a real switch, though, from seventy-five in the morning to thirty
at night, though.

B.48:  Um.

A.49:  We, we probably go from the forties to the twenties.

B.50:  Yeah, well, we don't have that too often, but it's gradually clearing off.
I think yesterday was in the seventies.  I haven't heard the temperature today
really --

A.51:  Right, maybe.

B.52:  -- but I did go shopping and it's cooler than it was yesterday.

A.53:  Do you need a jacket?

B.54:  Uh, yes, a light one.  I didn't wear one because I don't like a jacket.  I
just wore a sweatshirt, but no jacket.

A.55:  And that does it.

B.56:  Yeah, but it's beautiful, and, uh, but, I, I have never seen a white
Christmas, so we, we don't usually,

A.57:  You don't know what it is, huh?

B.58:  No I've never, huh-uh.

A.59:  Everybody around here is going crazy because they want a white Christmas,
and.

B.60:  Well, I do, I would like to have one, too, but I.

A.61:  They're pretty.

B.62:  Yeah, I think it'd be great.

A.63:  They're, they, they're the type of thing you only want to have once
[laughter].  They're not as fun to drive in, but they're sure.

B.64:  Yeah, it gets you in the spirit, but we have cold weather sometimes, and
most of our cold weather is in like Jan-, January and February, but we had
some cold weather in November, so it's just crazy.

A.65:  And, uh, you just don't know exactly what to expect when it goes like that,
do you [laughter].  Kind of --

B.66:  No.  Well, yeah, it, it gets cold here, it's just that it doesn't stay cold
like, I'm not sure how it is where you are, but, you know, in the northern
states it gets cold and stays cold all winter.

A.67:  -- stays that way --

B.68:  Yeah, and here --

A.69:  -- and the snow usually stays.

B.70:  -- right, and here we get cold and we may be cold for a week, you know,
down in the twenties and teens, but --

A.71:  Right.

B.72:  -- then it's back up to the forties and fifties.

A.73:  Then it shoots back up.

B.74:  Yeah, so it's, it's.

A.75:  This, uh, our area pretty much, you get, oh, we got snow for Thanksgiving,
and about three days later it was all gone.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  So, uh, it doesn't stick around very long.  

B.78:  Do you think your weather trends are changing?

A.79:  Well, y-, we've only lived here four and a half years, and, uh, it's been
fairly mild --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- from what I understand, uh, they've, they've talked about being snowed
in, and, and we've never had a bad, bad winter.

B.82:  Well, I, I, yeah, I think the weather trends are changing, too.  Now I
don't know whether it's everywhere or just here, because we've had so many
lakes built around here that.

A.83:  Right --

B.84:  I think it's --

A.85:  -- you think that's making a difference.

B.86:  -- oh, ye-, yeah, I think it's making a difference in that we have more bad
weather than we used to.

A.87:  Than you used to.

B.88:  Uh-huh, especially storms, but, they built the lakes for water, and I do
think it's made a difference in the weather.

A.89:  I think the weather seems like it's changed everywhere a little bit, hasn't
it --

B.90:  Yeah, well.

A.91:  -- just, uh, real peculiar, peculiar and not normal [laughter].

B.92:  I guess it's part of the warming trends.

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  And then too, they say the, that, uh, volcano in the Philippines, you know,
had a effect on.

A.95:  Right, we got a lot of the effects from that --

B.96:  Supposedly.

A.97:  -- and that's hard to believe, isn't it.

B.98:  I know [laughter].

A.99:  You wouldn't, you wouldn't think we could even be remo-,
