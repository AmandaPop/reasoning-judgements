REMARKS:        Speaker B dominated the conversation.  Speaker A
was hard to understand as his speech was very slow and drawn.

========================================================================

A.1:  All right.  Uh, what kind of hobbies are you into?  

@B.2:  Well, I'm quilting and, uh, p-, fact, I was pressing a, the, uh, pieces
for a quilt block I will stop, start stitching on [laughter] when the phone
rang.

A.3:  Okay [laughter].  

B.4:  So, where, uh, what are you into, woodwork?  

A.5:  Uh, no, uh, tole painting and -- 

B.6:  Oh. 

A.7:  -- uh, folk art.  Uh, 

B.8:  Yeah, I saw something, uh, you've seen these old wooden school desks, the
old ones.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  I saw some, uh, [lipsmack] or one, anyway in a shop here, oh, [breathing] I
don't even remember where I was [lipsmack] two or three weeks ago that had
been, uh, painted with, that looked like maybe just a flat finish and then
tole painting on it and the, uh, flowers and borders and trims and stuff and
it was just real pretty.

A.11:  Yeah.  Yeah, we, we used to live in Hillsboro and I, there's a, a lady
that I knew that had a, uh, gift shop and she gave art lessons and I've taken
lessons, Rayette got into it and tried a little bit of landscaping, so,
painting is pretty interesting.

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  How long you been quilting?   Quite a while, or,  

B.14:  No, not, uh, not a real long time.  It's about, uh, I guess it was in
probably, nineteen eighty-eight when I got into it.  And I belong to a quilt
guild in, in McKinney.  We just meet once a month, but, uh, we've had a
project going this last, almost a year now where we, uh, when I joined the
quilt guild, there was just, I made the, I think the thirteenth member and we
just wrote down the names of the months and then we all drew for, uh, a month
and everyone in the guild makes a block for the, the person who's turn it is
that month and we have the, uh, privilege of selecting a pattern or, of colors
or providing the material and the pattern or some of them just say, uh, for
instance the December is what they call a Christmas sampler and she gave us
one piece of, uh, fabric to use in it and then we have to come up with
something else to go with it and when they are all put together, needless to
say, they've got enough for a block and our guild has grown now to where we
have twenty members.

A.15:  Um.  

B.16:  And so, uh, February is when I get the blocks and my husband has picked
the, the pattern that he wants and the colors, so it will be, it will be
interesting.

A.17:  Yeah, it sounds like it [laughter].  I've seen some beautiful quilts
around.  I, I've got some that my mother made and I still have.

B.18:  Oh, goodness, those are, those are really family heirlooms and, 

A.19:  Yeah, I've got one that, uh, she made it out of the kids with the, you
know, Raggedy Ann and Andy patterns on it.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  And it's, some of the stitches, you know, have come loose on it, but you
know, I still keep it though [laughter].

B.22:  Right.  Do you work for Texas Instruments?  

A.23:  Uh, no, I, I work for J C Penney's.  Uh, the guy that, I'm in a, a scout
troop at St. (( ))'s church, by, uh, Six Thirty-Five and the tollway.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  And, uh, John Godfrey that, that T I, who is doing this, his son is in our
scout troop and he contacted us and he, he suggested that all the adult members
do this and turn the money in that they collected for the phone calls to the
troop so we, you know, pick up a little extra funds that way.

B.26:  Oh, well, that's good.  It really is.  That's a, a good fund raiser.

A.27:  Yeah.  It's, you know, easy way to pick up maybe a thousand dollars, and
get enough adults --

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  -- involved.  

B.30:  Yeah, it has been pretty quiet on the switchboard lately.  Uh, for a while
I was getting calls pretty often and then they, when the switchboard went down
for a while and then after it started up again, well, we haven't, uh, it
hasn't been real active.  I was a little surprised when I, uh, picked up the
phone tonight and got the recording --

A.31:  Uh-huh {very faint}.  

B.32:  -- you know, that it was, was back on and I have lost the number.  In fact,
maybe you could give it to me.

A.33:  Okay.  

B.34:  That you call in, uh, to, to make a call.  

A.35:  Okay, you got a,  

B.36:  And, uh, just a ((mumbling)), get over here where I can get to a pen.  Uh,
I may get an incoming call anytime, but, uh, my husband,
