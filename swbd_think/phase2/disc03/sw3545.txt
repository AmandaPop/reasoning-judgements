========================================================================= 

A.1:  Okay, um, tell me about where you live.

B.2:  I live in, uh, Richardson area.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Just close to, uh, Richland College.

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  Do you live in the area too?

A.7:  No, I live in Houston.

B.8:  Oh, okay.

A.9:  Although I did live in Dallas for, uh, six years, up until, uh,
nineteen ninety and then I, I moved to Houston.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  But, uh, I, uh, had lived in Houston before --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and, uh, from nineteen hundred eighty to nineteen hundred eighty-four,
and, uh, worked downtown, and when I was transferred from Atlanta, uh, to
Houston, I, I bought a condo in southwest Houston --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- you know, and I clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office,
and, of course, didn't think that would be bad, but the only time I ever drove
it was not during rush hour.

B.16:  Right [laughter].

A.17:  So, so ac-, it was a rude awakening to me to find out what I faced every
morning and every afternoon in Houston traffic.

B.18:  Oh.

A.19:  Because where I lived in Atlanta, I lived right on Peachtree.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Um, a mile and a half from the office, and so I wasn't accustomed to
commuting, and it nearly killed me.

B.22:  Um.

A.23:  So whenever I moved back to Houston, I said, I, I declared that I would not
live where I had to drive on the freeways, so now I live [breathing] in really
inner city, and, uh, but it's only, it takes me about ten minutes to get to
the office, and I love it [clicking].

B.24:  Uh-huh.  Well, what kind of a, a house is it now?  #Are you still in,# 

A.25:  #Well, I'm# in an apartment.

B.26:  Oh, okay.

A.27:  But, uh, [breathing] it's just, I don't know, it's, uh, I mean, most, most
of the people that I work with, you know, commute in anywhere from thirty to
forty-five minutes, some of them an hour or more,

B.28:  #Uh-huh.#

A.29:  #one# way.  And, you know [breathing] I mean, I've, I've had a house
before, and I mean, and it's nice, but it's just not worth it to me to sit
behind the wheel of a car for that long.

B.30:  [Noise] Right.

A.31:  I just, I can't do it #so,#  

B.32:  #Right.#

A.33:  Anyway, I'm ve-, I'm pretty content for the time being where I am.

B.34:  [Laughter] [noise].  Well, we, uh, rent a duplex right now, and it's only
like a couple of miles from where I work.

A.35:  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  #It's# a little bit further for my husband.  We used to both work at the
same building at T I, and it was only like two miles from the, uh, duplex.
Now he's moved, but he's going against the flow of the traffic, so it's not
too bad of a commute.  It only takes him about fifteen minutes.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  That isn't, that isn't bad, really.

B.38:  No.  He can get on the highway and [breathing] he's going north, whereas
most of the people are like in Plano going south, so he's, you know, in a good
[clicking] situation because the traffic is not as heavy in his direction.
But we've been looking for a house, but [/clicking] the first consideration to
us is location, you know.

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  #They# keep building further and further out, and of course, you can get
more house for the #money,#

A.41:  #Right.#

B.42:  and stuff, but, you know, to me, I'm the same way.  That day to day
commute, I #don't,#

A.43:  #I,# 

B.44:  like.

A.45:  You know, it's, like I said, I, I mean, I've even had people at the office
ask me, they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent,
because I do pay a lot of money every month for rent.  I don't deny it.  But
at the same time I said, well, you know, let's think about it
[throat_clearing].  I said I drive, uh, less than ten miles a day round trip.
And they go, you know, their jaws drop. #And ((then)),#

B.46:  #[Laughter].#

A.47:  and then they go, and I spend way less than thirty minutes a day round trip
commuting.  And, you know, that d-, that's regardless of the weather.  If it's
raining,

B.48:  [Clicking].

A.49:  it still doesn't take me any longer.  I mean, sometimes, whenever, and you
know how Houston is.  It's just so flat.

B.50:  Uh-huh [/clicking].

A.51:  And we have these torrential downpours sometimes, and people literally get,
you know, traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything, and it will
take them an hour and a half to get to work.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And they're just frayed by the time they get there [laughter].  I think no
way, so, 

B.54:  Yeah, and I think too, we both have a little bit older cars.  I mean, both
our cars are over ten years old now.  If you get a house, if you buy a house
more for your money further out, you're going to have to have a pretty decent
car and put a lot into, uh, [lipsmack] your car payments and your gas and
stuff.

A.55:  That's right.

B.56:  I mean, you know, if you've got to drive it sixty miles a day, you're going
to go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did.  I mean,
that's not something people think about, is the car, [clicking] the car
payments and the gas.

A.57:  Oh, I agree with you a hundred percent.  Since I've, um, [throat_clearing]
got this place, I mean, I used to,

B.58:  [/Clicking]. 

A.59:  I can remember years ago whenever I, especially whenever I lived in Houston
before, I used to put twenty thousand miles a year on my car.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  Last year I put less than twelve on my car.

B.62:  Um.

A.63:  You know?

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  And you can really tell a difference.  I mean, I just don't, you know, it's
just not, I don't have that expense.  And by the time I cut down the, the cost
of my insurance, because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so
close --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- then the additional automobile expense, [sigh] I don't know, it's, I, I
thought about it [breathing] it's, I mean, I would like to own again.  I've
owned in the past.  But [sigh] I don't know.  I'm, I'm hesitant to give up the
convenience.

B.68:  Yeah. 

A.69:  [Lipsmack]  Plus where I live is so well managed.  I mean, if I have any
little thing go wrong, I just pick up the phone at the office, I call my
manager, I say I've got this problem.  I come home in the afternoon, there's a
note on my dining room table saying we've been in, we fixed it, let us know if
there's a problem.

B.70:  [Laughter].

A.71:  You know, I love it, [laughter] I'll be honest with you #[laughter].#

B.72:  #Uh-huh.#
