A.1:  The way, I'll go ahead and start the way I work, uh, the way I dress --

B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  -- for work is, uh, this year, nineteen ninety-one has been really suit and
tie, or I shouldn't say suit, but coat and tie every day.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  A, a year ago, I changed jobs from being a researcher -- 

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- to doing marketing for the research group.

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  Which means kind of a, I guess it's a different set of standards, I guess.

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  So, uh, I, I dress almost the same every day.  I mean, pretty much it's a
white shirt and --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  -- slacks and shoes and -- 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  -- a coat.  

B.16:  [Laughter]. 

A.17:  But, it was very different before.  How do you dress?

B.18:  Well, I'm a drafter, so I just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and I have
sweatshirt on today.

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  And that's pretty much the norm for me.  If I come in in a dress,
everybody's shocked [laughter].

A.21:  Yeah, I understand.  

B.22:  They ask me, you know, what are you doing in a dress and it's usually I
haven't done my laundry lately [laughter].

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  Ran out of jeans [laughter].  

A.25:  I understand, that's funny [throat_clearing].  So, does it change?

B.26:  No.  

A.27:  Your dress, no.  

B.28:  No, huh-uh.  

A.29:  So, or, I guess, do you have things like presentations to do or anything
like that?

B.30:  No, huh-uh.  

A.31:  So, back in my old job, up until through nineteen eighty -- 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  -- I would usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like, but,
probably once a month or so, there was some reason that I would have to put on
a suit.

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  For a customer presentation or something.  

B.36:  Yeah, yeah.  Every now and then I'll get dressed up and come in, but that's
for my husband's job and not mine [laughter].

A.37:  Oh, I see, I understand.  

B.38:  I have to go to a business meeting once a month with him, but 
[laughter], 

A.39:  Oh.  Well, that's interesting.  

B.40:  So,  

A.41:  Let's see, uh, what else about this, uh, it, it seems like T I is pretty
cut and dried with two, like, two or three levels.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  That there's the t-, upper management that always wears gray suits.

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  And the people that don't, uh, I would, if you, if I want to say don't have
power or don't have authority or whatever --

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- like I used to be in that research -- 

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  -- and I guess you are.  

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  That we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the, the branch manager
level --

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  -- or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing.  

B.54:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.55:  But there's not much,  

B.56:  Mi-, middle of the road.  

A.57:  It's nice that there's not a requirement --  

B.58:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.59:  -- for it.

B.60:  Sometimes I think there should be.  Some of these women around here
[laughter] look like they came off of Harry Hines.

A.61:  Oh, yeah, right [laughter].  

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  Yeah, I guess you see those once in a while.   

B.64:  [Laughter] And you know the, they have the no shorts deal, and some of
these mini skirts, you know, are worse than shorts ever thought about being.

A.65:  Sure.  

B.66:  But, uh,  

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  You know, that's, I guess that's one of the things you got to put up with
when you don't have a dress code.

A.69:  That's right, that's right.  I guess they're, the, isn't there a dress
code, something about spaghetti straps, I'm not even sure what they are.

B.70:  Supposedly and backless things --

A.71:  Oh, backless, all right.

B.72:  -- but, I've seen those, too, but,   

A.73:  Okay, so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation, but, I think we, 

B.74:  [Laughter]. 

A.75:  we did it [laughter].  

B.76:  Uh, yeah.  

A.77:  Okay, and, and your name was Lisa.  

B.78:  Lisa.  

A.79:  Great.  

B.80:  Are you the Expressway sites?  

A.81:  I am, yes, and I work in the north building.  

B.82:  Oh, okay.  

A.83:  Uh, well, thank you.  

B.84:  Thank you.  

A.85:  All right, good day.  

B.86:  Uh-huh, bye-bye.
