========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, do you have young children?  

B.2:  Uh-huh, I have got two.  One is, uh, two and the other one's four and, uh,
this is my first year of staying home.  I've always had them in child care.

A.3:  Oh, well, then you are familiar with it?  

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  Okay, I, uh, I have grandchildren and I know, uh, one has gone to a, well,
two of them have gone to preschool.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.  Why don't
you tell me what you have found.

B.8:  Well, uh, the, with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out,
there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with and so I felt
that, that I need to move on with them and so I found another baby-sitter and
she was wonderful except I thought that there were too many in the home and it
just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care.  She was
wonderful, it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home.  It was
--

A.9:  Okay, so,  
 
B.10:  -- in home child care.  

A.11:  Okay, so it was in home child care.  You took them to someone's home?

B.12:  Uh-huh.  

A.13:  Well, both times?  

B.14:  Uh-huh, right.  

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  And, uh, and then I worked in, in the child care centers and I wasn't
really happy with the particular one that I was working in so I just always
had a fear about, you know, child care centers.  So that's why I put them in
a, in a in home day care.

A.17:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.18:  Uh-huh.  And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their
time whether they were so little and, and I couldn't get off of work as often
as I wanted to when they were ill so I just decided it was probably best just
to stay home for a while until they were a little more, [breathing] uh,
independent and, uh, I could go back to work.

A.19:  I know that in raising my children, uh, I was fortunate, I didn't have to
work, we didn't necessarily have a lot of things [laughter],

B.20:  Yeah [laughter].  That's how it's going now.  

A.21:  But, uh, and, I know my daughter, because she has three and, to have three
in day care, you know, even though one of them's in school full time, one of
them's, you know, in kindergarten.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  That is a lot of money.  I mean it's so expensive.  

B.24:  Oh, yeah.  

A.25:  You have to really make a lot of money.  

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate
with what's going on in their life.

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas
programs in the middle of the day or something.

B.30:  Oh, no, yeah.  

A.31:  You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known
chain, uh, she was not at all happy with.  It was, there was too many children
per person.  They were just kind of left to play, there was no structure to,
and the middle grandson went there as a, uh, like a preschool thing.

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of
learning and training and stuff.  Not just there, you know, so he went like,
uh, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.

B.34:  Wow.  

A.35:  And, uh, you know, and it was supposed to be a base, you know, starting to
learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children --

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  -- so that when he went to, you know, school -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- and stuff, and, uh, she was most unhappy with it.  

B.40:  Huh.   

A.41:  There was no structure, there was nothing to it.  You know, and, uh, she
pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent.
It was, it was like a little kindergarten.

B.42:  Uh-huh.  

A.43:  And, uh, they had hot lunches and, and they had classes that, you know, one
class they'd do art.  They even familiarized the children with computers.

B.44:  Oh. 

A.45:  Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent -- 

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  -- one.  

B.48:  And how old was he?  

A.49:  He's now five and a half.  He's in kindergarten.  

B.50:  Oh.  

A.51:  This was last year.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And, uh, so, you know, it helped him and, and the first one, uh, he went to
a, uh, church preschool --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- that was very good.  

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  The Methodist Church in Richardson.  

B.58:  Oh. 

A.59:  The big one and it was a excellent, they, very good.  

B.60:  My little boy goes to the Methodist, uh, in Garland.  

A.61:  Oh, does he?  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  I'm real happy with that one.  

A.63:  Yeah, they, uh, the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run.

B.64:  Well, I've, I've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent. 

A.65:  Oh, really?  

B.66:  Uh-huh.  Even the [throat_clearing], even the Mother's Day Out programs, I
heard, are real good.

A.67:  Oh. I had, uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know --

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  -- experience there, that, you know, that they were good.  I --

B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  -- I didn't know that, uh, you know, I'm not that familiar.  I just know
that, you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was --

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  -- just a great program.  

B.74:  Yeah, because this is First United Methodist in Garland -- 

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- that he goes to and I'm real happy with that.  

A.77:  Yeah, it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it?  

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  So,  

B.82:  Well, that's a,  

A.83:  Well, are you enjoying staying home?  

B.84:  Yes, I am [laughter].  

A.85:  [Laughter]. 

B.86:  Uh, I taught for Richardson School District -- 

A.87:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.88:  -- and, uh, I taught early childhood and I really enjoyed it, but it was
just, it was taking a lot of my time and I noticed I was spending less and
less time with them and it just seemed like they were sick more often --

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  -- and I just couldn't get the time off to, so,   

A.91:  Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and
deal --

B.92:  Yeah, it is.  

A.93:  -- with young children.  

B.94:  It really is.  

A.95:  And have enthusiasm.  

B.96:  Yeah, it really is.  And I felt,
