=====================================================================

A.1:   Well, what do you, uh, [throat_clearing] how do you feel about
your, uh, job benefits?  

@B.2:   Well, I'm a contract person and, uh, so I don't have a lot of
benefits and, uh, uh, I do think they're very important.  My
husband has medical insurance and he has a life insurance policy. 
His company does not really have a retirement plan and I think
that's something that's very important.  

A.3:   Uh-huh.  

B.4:   And, uh, I believe medical insurance and retirement are
probably the two strongest.   

A.5:   Yeah, well, I, uh -- 

B.6:   Two most important.  

A.7:   -- [Throat_clearing] I worked for a large oil company -- 

B.8:   Uh-huh.  

A.9:   -- for ten years and then resigned in eighty-four and went
into business for myself.  Uh, and what I discovered at one, after
I had resigned it was kind of amazing, I had never really thought
about that corporate umbrella -- 

B.10:   Yes [laughter].  

A.11:   -- while it was there -- 

B.12:   Right.  

A.13:   -- and after I resigned and I walked out from under it, I
really felt exposed.  

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   And it was something that I had been completely, you know, you
grow accustomed to having that behind you or -- 

B.16:   Yeah, you sort -- 

A.17:   -- or over you.  

B.18:   -- of take it for granted.  

A.19:   Absolutely.  And it was, I, I tell you, I was absolutely
amazed at how, at, at the difference.  And then, [laughter] plus
whenever I had to start paying for my own health insurance -- 

B.20:   Oh, I know.  Isn't that a shock?  

A.21:   -- and, and life insurance.  Believe me, it was, it was a rude
awakening.  So anyway, I was in business for myself for six years,
and then I have gone back to work, uh, since, uh, nineteen ninety. 
I'm back in Houston with another oil company, so I'm back under
that corporate umbrella and I will tell you, I am glad to have the
coverage again [laughter].  

B.22:   Well, we, uh, kind of discovered it when, uh, the company 
my,  

A.23:   [Cough]. 

B.24:   husband was with, uh, was in real estate and he had some
nice benefits with it and, all of a sudden when the market dropped
out up here,  

A.25:   [Cough]. 

B.26:   of course and, you know, everything kind of went downhill. 

A.27:   Right.  

B.28:   And then he went with a steel company and they, they folded
but he was still under the, uh, Cobra plan on the medical 
insurance -- 

A.29:   Uh-huh.  

B.30:   -- and then all of a sudden, the people that had taken it over
went bankrupt.  Well, that ended Cobra plan and everything.  

A.31:   Yeah.  

B.32:   And, uh, then we discovered, and our medical insurance for
three months was running us, uh, I think it was nineteen hundred
dollars.  

A.33:   Holy moly!  

B.34:   Yeah, our age and, uh -- 

A.35:   Uh-huh.  

B.36:   -- I had some arthritis and stuff -- 

A.37:   Uh-huh.  

B.38:   -- and man they socked it to us.  

A.39:   Yeah.  

B.40:   And, you know,  

A.41:   Well,  

B.42:   But now, fortunately we, we're back, we have some medical
insurance.  

A.43:   Well, I feel like, I'm, I'm the luckiest person in the world
on, in several ways.  Number one, I had the opportunity to get out
whenever I left, uh, uh, Houston in, uh, eighty-four and resigned,
I had the opportunity to get out and do all those things that I
thought would be so glamorous and exciting -- 

B.44:   [Laughter]  Yeah.  

A.45:   -- wording, working for myself.

B.46:   Yeah.

A.47:   And they were, and they were for a while and then I found out
that it was just as much work to do that as it is going into an
office.  

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   You know, getting on a plane and flying around and all that
kind of stuff.  And,  

B.50:   What did you do, consulting work?  

A.51:   Well, no, actually, I was, uh, my brother and I had a
architectural design firm.  

B.52:   Oh, uh-huh.  

A.53:   We did, uh, retail tenant finish out all over the U S. 

B.54:   Uh-huh.  

A.55:   And it was, you know, very successful and a lot of fun and
more work than I've ever done in my life and at the same time I got
all of that out of my system,  

B.56:   [Laughter]. 

A.57:   and it is so, it's so wonderful now, and I'm so
appreciative, too.  And, and I know, now, I think, so much better
than some of my coworkers what it means to have somebody that's
providing -- 

B.58:   [Laughter] Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- some of this stuff for you.  And, uh, you know, I'm real
lucky.  My company has good, uh, health benefits -- 

B.60:   Benefits.  

A.61:   -- and, dental and also, uh, retirement plan on a contributory
thrift plan -- 

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   -- that I'm, I was just thinking about that today.  I need to
up my contribution to that if I can force myself to save a little
bit more.  

B.64:   Uh-huh.  Well, I know that my husband, the company he's with
now has excellent, uh, hospitalization and prescription card and
dental insurance, but they have no retirement -- 

A.65:   Uh-huh.  

B.66:   -- benefits.  

A.67:   Yeah.  

B.68:   And, you know, we definitely, you know, miss this.  I grew up
in a family that had their own business.  You cannot pay me enough
money to go into business for myself.  And my husband [laughter]
has watched my family, and I don't believe you could pay him
enough.  

A.69:   Yeah, well, I tell you, until you've done it, you don't know
what it's like.  You, y-, it's on your mind twenty-four hours a 
day -- 

B.70:   Uh-huh.  

A.71:   -- seven days a week -- 

B.72:   Uh-huh.  

A.73:   -- and I, I literally drove myself nearly insane.  I was at
the office on Saturdays -- 

B.74:   Uh-huh.  

A.75:   -- and Sundays. 

B.76:   Uh-huh.  

A.77:   I would get up at,  

B.78:   You're always,  

A.79:   I'd get up at, I'd be sitting around at, at nine, nine o'clock
at night and get up and go to the office and work until one
o'clock.  

B.80:   Uh-huh.  

A.81:   You know, and,  

B.82:   Well, and, you think you know, okay, [laughter] are the
employees going to get paid this week [laughter].  You know, are --

A.83:   Precisely.

B.84:   -- we going to meet our -- 

A.85:   Precisely.  

B.86:   -- things and,  

A.87:   And then the employees get paid and you don't.  

B.88:   That's right.  

A.89:   [Laughter]. 

B.90:   That's right.  I can remember my dad saying, somebody saying
they wished, you know, beef wasn't so high, you know, they could
only afford chicken and my dad said if someone doesn't buy some
beef, I'm not going to be able to afford the chicken.  

A.91:   Yeah, yeah.  

B.92:   You know, and,  

A.93:   Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, the odds are definitely
stacked against the small business person.  

B.94:   They, they really are.  

A.95:   Uh,  

B.96:   They really are.  

A.97:   The problem that we ran into is that, you know, we, we got
beyond just being a real t-,
