========================================================================

B.1:  All of our children are, um, uh, about two of them are back in the house
now but they're all grown twenty-one and over.

A.2:  Uh-huh.  

B.3:  So, uh,

A.4:  And how did you spend time with them when they were young?  

B.5:  I guess like everybody else, soccer games and all sorts of games and
carpools and traveling and, uh, we, we seem to be together enough.

A.6:  Uh-huh.  #Well,# 

B.7:  #Uh,# was, there was always one parent here at least because, um, we would
never usually leave together.

A.8:  Uh-huh.  

B.9:  And I usually work, teach at night and my wife was here in the daytime, I
mean at night, and then I was here most of the day if they were, when they
were here.  So, they didn't spend a lot of time by themselves.

A.10:  How many children do you have?  

B.11:  Three.  

A.12:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.13:  Two girls and a boy.  

A.14:  Uh-huh.  

B.15:  #So,#  

A.16:  #Well,# I had two boys and I'm a grandmother now, 

B.17:  #Oh, you are?# 

A.18:  #so# my children are grown also and they live away from me so I don't see
them much but, 

B.19:  Well, we had, uh, tha-, tho-, they were all away and now there's, uh, one
is coming back from college and the other one has just graduated a-, s-, back
home so.

A.20:  Uh-huh.  Oh, I, I tried to spend a lot of time with my children when they
were young.  We spent a lot of value time, um, creating things and building
things,

B.21:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.22:  #together.#  I feel the families watch too much T V today.  

B.23:  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  That's the tru-, we didn't have a T V for three and
a half years when they were in early school for some reason and they did so
much better and then we went back to T V's.

A.24:  Uh-huh.  

B.25:  You can just see it that,

A.26:  Well I tried to put a limit on it when they were in school to, so, they
could only watch so many hours per day --

B.27:  Uh-huh.  

A.28:  -- of T V #so.# 

B.29:  #Where# did your kids go to school?  

A.30:  Well, we trav-, we moved around quite a bit, 

B.31:  #Oh.# 

A.32:  #so# they went to a lot of different, 

B.33:  #They weren't,# 

A.34:  #schools.# 

B.35:  here in north Dallas, huh?  

A.36:  No.  

B.37:  Oh.  

A.38:  They did go a year in Palestine.  

B.39:  Uh-huh.  

A.40:  But we did move around quite a bit so.  

B.41:  Yeah.  Well, 

A.42:  #But,# 

B.43:  #I don't know# that I, I just, uh, that's, that, that T V is probably one
of the problems and then both parents working and --

A.44:  Right, right.  

B.45:  -- uh, that's a, I don't think a good situation but I don't imagine that
will change.

A.46:  I don't think so either.  It takes two incomes now anyway.  

B.47:  Right.  So, 

A.48:  But I feel that I didn't get to spend as much time with my children as I
could have or as I should have.

B.49:  #You probably didn't i-,# 

A.50:  #I, I was a# working mother and,  

B.51:  That's right, if you had to work.  

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  Uh, it's just almost impossible.  

A.54:  Uh-huh.   

B.55:  Especially when they get up to the age where they have so many things they
want to do on their own so.

A.56:  Uh-huh.  I remember the things that they really liked.  My oldest son he
liked kites.  He always wanted, always building kites and working on those.

B.57:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.58:  #He loved# kites.  

B.59:  So, uh, well, my, all three of mine ran sports so we spent a al-, a lot of
time with the different sports activities --

A.60:  Uh-huh.   

B.61:  -- because they all played and, uh, now they're all in college or one, two,
one out and two in still in college so.

A.62:  Well, mine la-, were in the music end of it instead of sports. 

B.63:  #Uh-huh.#

A.64:  #They did,# my oldest son did play a little football and soccer but I had
them in the band.  They were playing horns in the band and, 

B.65:  Yeah.  So, well, we probably, if they're alive and kicking, we probably did
a decent job.

A.66:  Yeah.  Nobody is perfect.  All you can do is your best and,

B.67:  Right.   

A.68:  [Laughter]. 

B.69:  Sh-, uh, absolutely.  

A.70:  [Laughter]. 

B.71:  That's true.  So, anyway, well, 

A.72:  I have three grandsons now and I, one of them, uh, two of them is in
California and one of them is in Arizona.  I'm going to get to see them at
Christmas time.

B.73:  Oh, great.  #Yeah.# 

A.74:  #I'm,# I'm going to, I'm going to enjoy that.  

B.75:  I would hope so.  

A.76:  They're all little.  They are little kids so.  

B.77:  Yeah.  #That will be,# 

A.78:  #But I bought# little things for them to, 

B.79:  #Yeah.#  

A.80:  #work on,#

B.81:  #That will be fun.# 

A.82:  #and to try to keep them# busy.  

B.83:  Look forward to that.  You're going to fly out there?  

A.84:  No, I'm going to drive --

B.85:  Oh, you are?  

A.86:  -- to Arizona.  Uh-huh.  

B.87:  Oh, I've done that a few times.  

A.88:  [Laughter]. 

B.89:  That's a tough drive.   

A.90:  It's worth it to see my family.  

B.91:  Sure.  You just going to try to spend the, uh, spend the night somewhere?

A.92:  #Oh, yes.# 

B.93:  #((Well,))#

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  we always stopped at Pecos that seemed li-, like it was a good, 

A.96:  I have a sister in New Mexico so I'm going to stop there #at my sister's.#

B.97:  #Oh, yeah.#  Well, that will be great.  

A.98:  Uh-huh.  

B.99:  So, well anyway, it's good to talk to you.  

@@A.100:  Well, th-, they won't be upset with us if we hang up too soon?

B.101:  I don't, I don't know.  I think,

A.102:  [Laughter] I haven't done that before.  Usually I talk and talk and talk.

B.103:  They usually come on and say something, don't they?  

A.104:  Uh, [laughter] yeah.  

B.105:  Well, that's all right.  

A.106:  When our five minutes are up.  

B.107:  How long have you been with, uh, T I?  

A.108:  Oh, I'm just a temporary.

A.110:  #I work# for Manpower there.  

B.111:  Oh, okay.  

A.112:  And, uh, what do you teach in,

B.113:  I teach history.  

A.114:  Oh.  

B.115:  Yeah.  

A.116:  Oh.  

B.117:  So, uh, 

A.118:  That's, very few, 

B.119:  #Yeah, there's not, not many,# 

A.120:  #people are interested in that.#   

B.121:  people like it, #but it's, uh, you can get them,#

A.122:  #History, yeah, and chemistry.#

B.123:  get them hooked on it it's pretty good.
