===========================================================================

A.1:   Yes, we're going there.  

B.2:   On our way.  

A.3:   Well, uh, this is a good topic for me because I just got off
a jury on Friday [laughter].  

B.4:   Oh, I'll bet it is a good topic then.  

@A.5:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  Have you ever been on a jury before?  

B.6:   I have been on a jury once -- 

A.7:   Uh-huh.  

B.8:   -- and that was an experience of a lifetime.  

A.9:   Really?  What kind of a trial was it?  

B.10:   It was just a, it was like a civil suit -- 

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   -- uh, and I really felt that by the end of it I had no
respect whatsoever for our jury system.  

A.13:   Oh, really?  

B.14:   Yeah.  

A.15:   What, what did you think was wrong with it?  

B.16:   Well [breathing], we all had to agree.  It, well, we didn't
all have to agree because it was a civil suit.  

A.17:   Uh-huh.  

B.18:   Ten out of twelve had to agree.  

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   And we had like twelve questions -- 

A.21:   Uh-huh.  

B.22:   -- and the exact same ten people had to agree on all twelve
questions.  

A.23:   Uh-huh.  

B.24:   And that's really hard.  

A.25:   Yeah.  

B.26:   I mean, we deliberated for ten hours.  

A.27:   Wow.  

B.28:   And that was a long time -- 

A.29:   Yeah.  

B.30:   -- and people got with each other -- 

A.31:   Uh-huh.  

B.32:   -- and, I mean, it just was not a good situation.  

A.33:   Huh, that's interesting.  

B.34:   And, you know, by the end of it, I didn't feel like anybody
won.  

A.35:   Really?  

B.36:   I feel like we compromised, compromised until
we got to the point that nobody won.  

A.37:   Wow, that's, 

B.38:   What about yours?  

A.39:   Well, I've been on two actually and the first one I, was on
was also a civil trial but it was real apparent to all of us what,
what the situation was.  So it was real simple.  

B.40:   Um.  

A.41:   Uh, and we only deliberated as, maybe three hours and we
weren't really deliberating, we were reading through the whole
charge.  And, and trying to understand what the judge had written. 

B.42:   Yeah.  

A.43:   But I mean, beyond that, we really didn't have much debate. 
Uh, but the one I just got off of was capital murder trial.  

B.44:   Wow.  

A.45:   And, uh, that, uh, uh, I don't know if it's fortunate or not,
I was an alternate so I sat through five days of the trial and it's
sort of like seeing five days of a movie and missing the last
couple minutes because I don't know what happened yet.  

B.46:   [Breathing]. 

A.47:   And,  

B.48:   Oh, because you weren't allowed to go into -- 

A.49:   That's right.  

B.50:   -- deliberations, were you?  

A.51:   That's right.  

B.52:   [Breathing]. 

A.53:   And they also, they can't report it on T V or anything, so I
don't know, you know, until it's completely over, I won't know what
happened.  

B.54:   Oh, wow.  

A.55:   So, it was, it was really interesting and, and I,  

B.56:   Are, are you real definite as to how you think you would have
voted and everything?  

A.57:   I, I was leaning one way or another but I really needed to
look at some of the evidence -- 

B.58:   Uh-huh.  

A.59:   -- to make sure, but it, it, you know, it was fairly clear and
I talked to the judge afterwards and, you know, and knowing what I
know, know now, which the other jurors didn't know, I'd definitely
convict the guy.  Because he was, he was found involved in two more
of them and he was caught on the scene at the third one.  So, it
was -- 

B.60:   Oh, wow.  

A.61:   -- was fairly obvious, you know, that he had done it and
eventually I'm sure one of the, in one of the three trials they'll
probably convict him if not the first.  But, uh,  

B.62:   But, is this one the first?  

A.63:   This is the first one they tried him on, yeah.  

B.64:   Wow.  

A.65:   So it was, it was,  

B.66:   Where are you from?  

A.67:   Uh, I'm in North Dallas.  

B.68:   Oh, okay.  

A.69:   Where are you?  

B.70:   Plano.  

A.71:   Oh, okay.  Well, this happened in Plano [laughter].  

B.72:   [Laughter]. 

A.73:   You'll be thrilled to know.  

B.74:   What trial are you talking about?  

A.75:   Excuse me?  

B.76:   What trial are you talking about?  

A.77:   Uh, well, the one I was involved was at, uh, Warehouse
Beverage.  It's on, uh, I think it's Fifteenth and Avenue K.  

B.78:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.79:   And the one he was later involved in was the Texaco one.  

B.80:   Uh-huh.  

A.81:   And, I don't know what the third one was.  

B.82:   Oh, my.  

A.83:   But the Texaco one,  

B.84:   I'll have to watch the paper then.  

A.85:   Yeah. 

B.86:   When did they go into, when did they go into deliberations?  

A.87:   On Friday.  But that was just -- 

B.88:   Oh. 

A.89:   -- the guilt and innocence phase and I don't know, you know,
then there is the punishment phase after that.  

B.90:   Now, is the jury going to decide the punishment phase?  

A.91:   Uh, well, all they can decide, they don't really h-, say we
want capital punishment or we want something, or life imprisonment. 
You know, if they find him guilty, those are the two options -- 

B.92:   Uh-huh.  

A.93:   -- for capital murder, but they had six, six choices what he
was guilty of.  

B.94:   Uh-huh.  

A.95:   Uh, but all they can do, there is three questions that they
have to evaluate.  One being could he be a future threat to people. 
Well, he's already proven that.  But, you know, a couple questions
like that -- 

B.96:   Uh-huh.  

A.97:   -- and your answers are yes or no and if you get, I think it
is three yeses, it's capital punishment.  Or you can decide if
there is mitigating fact, or something to that effect.  But it's
not like you go and say, you know, we, we recommend this
punishment.  You just say, we answered these questions this way.  

B.98:   And that's what it,  

A.99:   And it leads you to -- 

B.100:   That's what it leads to.  

A.101:   -- the punishment, yeah.  

B.102:   Wow.  

A.103:   So, it was really interesting.  

B.104:   Huh.  

A.105:   And I wish I knew if they were still in deliberations, but I
don't [laughter].  

B.106:   Well, is it, when did you say it was, Friday?  

A.107:   Friday they went into deliberations, but -- 

B.108:   Saturday, Sunday, Monday [whispering].

A.109:   -- I don't know if the press can report at the end of the p-,
the guilt and innocence phase or if they have to wait until the
whole punishment thing is over because that will take another
couple weeks.  

B.110:   Wow.  

A.111:   So, but it was, it was really interesting.  

B.112:   So you enjoyed yours, then.  

A.113:   Well, I, it, I learned a lot.  What I didn't enjoy was not
being able to plan anything in my whole life.  

B.114:   Right.  

A.115:   Because, I mean, as far as I knew, this could take months. 
Some of them do.  

B.116:   Oh, yeah, some of them do.  

A.117:   And that was the thing, you know, with Christmas and
everything and I couldn't make reservations to go home, but, uh,
you know, now that it's over, it was really interesting.  

B.118:   Who was the judge?  

A.119:   Uh, [breathing] Nathan or Nathaniel White.  

B.120:   Nath-,
