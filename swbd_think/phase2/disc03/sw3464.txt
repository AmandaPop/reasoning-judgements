=========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, which ones have you seen lately?

B.2:  Oh, I just sort of blanking tonight.  I just got done saying I just saw
one, uh, fairly recently.  Uh, oh, gosh, oh, I know, uh, uh, the one with the
two girls that take off from, uh, uh, a-, across, across the country on a
crime spree.

A.3:  THELMA AND LOUISE,

B.4:  THELMA AND LOUISE, yeah.  

A.5:  Yeah.  I haven't seen that.  Is it good?  

B.6:  Yeah, it really is, it's, it's interesting.  

A.7:  Is it?  

B.8:  Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it.  I was going to go see, uh, the Billy Crystal
movie, also, which was, I'm a little bit behind.  I usually rent them
[laughter].

A.9:  Yeah, I, I'm not familiar.  Which, which Billy Crystal movie? 

B.10:  Oh, this is the, uh, just the one, oh, gosh, it was the, uh,

A.11:  Oh, CITY SLICKERS,

B.12:  CITY SLICKERS, right.  

A.13:  That's a real good show.   

B.14:  Have you seen that?  

A.15:  Yeah, it's great.  Uh, it says a lot about, uh, uh, you know, I, I'm young,
but it says a lot about middle life --

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  -- you know, and, uh, uh, it's a really good show.  

B.18:  Yeah, I, I, I've heard lots of good things about it and I would have, would
have liked to have seen it, but I was with my wife and I figured she'd like
THELMA AND LOUISE better so,

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  And I'd heard it was really good, too so,

A.21:  Yeah.  Uh, [throat_clearing] yeah, I'm not too familiar with THELMA AND
LOUISE.  Uh, [throat_clearing] uh, uh, recently I, I've seen, uh, the FISHER
KING.  Have you seen that?

B.22:  No.  

A.23:  It's a really good show.  

B.24:  Okay.  

A.25:  Uh, has Jeff Bridges and, and, uh, [lipsmack] Robin Williams. 

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  Uh, really, really good.  

B.28:  Yeah, there's, there's been a, a fair number of, of pretty good movies out
recently.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  I mean it kind of runs in, [laughter] in batches, I mean, for a while,
sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just, I don't even, you 
know --

A.31:  Yeah.  

B.32:  -- doesn't even sound like something I want to see. 

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  What, what kind of movies in general do you like to watch?  

A.35:  Uh, [throat_clearing] well, I like to be entertained once in a while but,
I, I really enjoy watching a movie that, uh, where they don't really try and
attract the, you know, the great audience, but rather put out a, a real good
movie.

B.36:  Uh-huh.  

A.37:  Uh, it always, my, my favorite movie of all time has been, uh, uh, THE
MISSION.  Did you ever see that?

B.38:  No, in fact, I'm not even familiar with it, I don't think.  

A.39:  Uh, it's a, a [throat_clearing], I think it's put out by Landmark
Productions, the same people who put out CHARIOTS OF FIRE.

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  Uh, it's a, it's a, has Robert DeNiro in it.  Uh, he plays one of the main
characters and, uh, it's about, uh, Jesuit community in, uh, [lipsmack] at
the Inca Falls in, in, uh, South America, Northern Argentina.

B.42:  Oh, uh-huh {very faint}.  

A.43:  Uh, really, really good show.  

B.44:  No, in fact, I, I, I'll, I'll look for it because I [laughter],

A.45:  Yeah, it's, it's something that, you know, it's, it's really stirring.  The
cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good
music.

B.46:  Actually yeah, my wife's from down in that region around the s-, the,
called the, the Seven Missions which are, which are right down in this, where
I'm sure where it was filmed at.

A.47:  Oh. 

B.48:  And, uh,

A.49:  Yeah.  

B.50:  I'm sure that, that would make it worth, worth her watching.  She, my, my,
uh, my movie watching has, has, severely, uh, has, has changed a lot since I
got married.

A.51:  Oh, yeah?  

B.52:  Yeah, she, she likes, uh, action movies and, uh, and, and comedies and so
anything that's, has anything --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- little, is a little, little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood
is --

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  -- is boring to her [laughter].  

A.57:  Oh. 

B.58:  And, and so I, I, I, I really, I used to watch a fair number of foreign
films.  I used to watch a lot of, sort of, the less, the less popular films.

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  And I find I don't do it anymore or else I have to watch them on my own.

A.61:  [Laughter] I'm much the same way.  I, I, I, I have a fiance and, it, it
gets very difficult to, uh, uh, 

B.62:  Find something both of you will watch.  

A.63:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.64:  She, it's funny because most women aren't really, she's sort of
Schwarzenegger fan type of.

A.65:  Oh, really?  

B.66:  Yeah, she really likes all these gory -- 

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- shoot them up films. 

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  Keep her on the edge of her seat.  

A.71:  [Laughter]. 

B.72:  I'll watch them, you know, they're kind of fun to watch in a way.

A.73:  Yeah, they are.  Sometimes you're in the mood for it even.  

B.74:  [Laughter] But, uh, so it, it, it varies, I don't seem to get, you know,
as much variety these days lately --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- as I used to.  

A.77:  I found when, when I get, when I get with my, uh, old college buddy, we, we
usually rent, uh, good gladiator movie or two [breathing].

B.78:  [Laughter]. 

A.79:  Uh, (( )) I still enjoy watching those.  You can't just watch them by
yourself or else,

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  it's not bearable.  But it's, it's fun to,

B.82:  Well, yeah, on the other hand, you know, given that my wife likes those, I,
I, say, I occasionally like to watch them and, and so, uh, you know, so it's,
you can always count on her to watch something like that [noise].  And she'll
even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that.

A.83:  Oh, yeah?  

B.84:  You know, which most, most women now [laughter] -- 

A.85:  Yeah, yeah, that's, that's,

B.86:  -- won't, they won't come within ten feet of,

A.87:  [Laughter] The ones where they dub in, dub in the English.  

B.88:  All the, all the ((ya)) [laughter].  

A.89:  [Laughter]. 

B.90:  All the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air [laughter].

A.91:  [Laughter]. 

B.92:  ((A-cha!)). 

A.93:  That's great.  Uh, uh, on foreign films did, uh, did you, did you watch,
are you, uh, fluent in another language or,

B.94:  I s-, yeah, I speak several, uh, but, I, I don't mind watching subtitle
movies.  Uh,

A.95:  Oh, you don't?  

B.96:  No, I, I,

A.97:  I don't either.  I, I feel foolish sometimes because I, I don't speak
another language fluently but I do enjoy watching --

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  -- you know, subtitles.  

B.100:  I mean, for some people, that's just, you know, that's out of the question,
you know.  You give it subtitles, they won't watch,
