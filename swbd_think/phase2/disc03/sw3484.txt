A.1:  you feel about, drug testing in the work place?  

B.2:  Well, actually, I'm all for it.  Even though, uh, [lipsmack] for instance,
like, in the area that I work for, you know, there's no danger, you know, of
someone getting hurt because of, you know, being on drugs or something.  But,
uh, [lipsmack] uh, [breathing] I think because of ethics involved and, uh,
things, I'm just, I'm in favor of it.  I, I realize that that's putting a lot
of [breathing] government control in effect or, or control over people but,
uh,

A.3:  I think we need something in place, to uh, solve the problems.  I
certainly, uh, feel that it ought to be done in public safety situations, you
know --

B.4:  Oh, definitely.  

A.5:  -- flight pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses
and taxi cabs.

B.6:  Well, it's just like, uh, I can't remember now where it was, what, two,
three months ago there's that, there was that bad train wreck and, uh, one of
the, uh, engineers --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- running the train was on drugs.  

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  You know, and people were killed in it and, and, yeah, when it comes to
safety and people being killed I definitely think it should be a requirement,
you know.

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  You're, uh, you know, to heck with their rights, you know, they're
interfering with people's rights to live.

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  You know, if they're in that type of position and have that much control
over people.

A.15:  One of the issues that came up for me personally was that, uh, we see, I've
gotten involved in, uh, foster care.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  And I've seen a lot of, uh, kids come into foster care as a result of their
parents being on drugs.

B.18:  Yes.  

A.19:  And, uh, there's probably a lot out there that could probably stand public
assistance or being rescued, uh, which aren't identified.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  And so, uh, testing at the work place in, in general, I think is probably a
good idea.  To, to save some of the kids.

B.22:  Feeling like that, if you know, then you can look into a situation and, in
case there are children involved?

A.23:  Yes.  

B.24:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I can, I can understand that.  I, I think it is, you know, I
think it's so sad these, these crack babies that are now coming into, you
know, grade school, elementary --

A.25:  Uh,

B.26:  -- school, you know, that are so, uh, oh, [breathing] you know, they're so
messed up themselves.  And, you know, in talking to teachers, I have several,
uh, friends that are teachers, [breathing] they, uh, uh, you know, they're
hard to control, they're hard to deal with --

A.27:  Uh,

B.28:  -- and yeah, I think that would be a good idea.   

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  Being I'm a contract person with Texas Instruments and before I could even
go to work here, I had to be drug tested.

A.31:  Uh,

B.32:  You know, and they do a random drug testing of their employees.  Uh, but so
f-, far, uh, they don't require everyone to do it.  They just go through
randomly and pick someone and, you know --

A.33:  Yeah.  

B.34:  -- and go do it.  So T I has an excellent, uh, assistance program if you're
f-, you know, found with drugs they actually give you, I think, uh, three
tries --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- you know, to, to quit it or get off of it or, or whatever before you're,
you know, dismissed.  I mean, they work with you and they, they have a
program, uh, uh, that you can go to that the company picks up the tab for and
also it's really an excellent program.  I, it seems like the older ones here
are in favor of it, the younger ones, you know, course are still, they either,
you know, doing some marijuana [laughter] or something, or they're very
idealistic.

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  You know, and, uh, I don't know, I think sometimes the older that you get,
I think the more ramifications you can see of so many things.

A.39:  Well, our company, uh, testing when you're hired is a requirement.

B.40:  Is it?  

A.41:  And, I think they have a policy of, uh, random testing, but, uh, I don't
know whether they've ever done it or not.  I kind of wish they would.

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.43:  Uh, and we do have an employee assistance program that's, uh, good for, uh,
drug abuse, uh, treatments and other psychological --

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- problems.  

B.46:  Uh-huh.  

A.47:  Like stress in the work place, marital problems, [laughter] whatever's
bothering you.

B.48:  Yeah, this, this program, you know, encompasses everything, but, you know,
I thought, you know, it's not an instant dismissal if you are found to be
taking drugs, which I think, you know, is good and is good on T, T I -s part.
As I said, I think they give you three chances, you know --

A.49:  What,

B.50:  -- to come to grips with it before you're dismissed.  

A.51:  You know, a lot of times I can see problems here at work, though.  Uh, I
remember a few years back I had a, uh, schematic drawing that needed to be
done and I was in a hurry to get it out.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  Well, I sent these drawings, the rough draft over to drafting and I usually
do a pretty decent drawing myself.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  When the drawing came back, uh, it was apparent that it had been
done by two people, because the line work,
