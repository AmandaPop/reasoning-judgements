REMARKS:        Speaker A had a lot of talking in the background.

=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  What do you think about it?  

B.2:  Uh, well, immigration, I know they're really strict right now because my
hundr-, husband is from out of the country and, uh, we had to go through a
whole, very long process to, uh, to, assure the government that he was, uh,
marrying me --

@A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  -- and not to be a resident here.  

A.5:  That's interest-, yeah, I think that's, uh, I think it's a little crazy.  I
worked with Spanish people --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- for about two years and just, it was incredible to me to see the things
that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers.

B.8:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, you can't just come over to the country
because, uh, you want to.

A.9:  Right.  

B.10:  You know, that's not good enough.  You have to have a, have to have a darn
good reason of, political or whatever.

A.11:  Right, exactly.  

B.12:  Not a good, not a good easy way to get in.  

A.13:  Yeah, I think, you know, I think in a lot of ways the law is good because
it tries to, to protect, you know, the people who are in the states.

B.14:  Exactly.  My mother, uh, actually knew a woman [breathing] in another state
that used to marry men --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- just, n-, she'd never even meet them and she'd just get money for it.

A.17:  Oh, you're kidding.  

B.18:  Huh-uh.  So, uh,  

A.19:  [Laughter]. 

B.20:  [Breathing]. 

A.21:  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Yeah, it's amazing to me how, how many things
they would allow to occur before, you know, you can come in.

B.22:  Exactly.  But, I mean, with the new laws, it's -- 

A.23:  Right.  

B.24:  -- it's tough now.  

A.25:  Yeah, it's kind of frustrating, too, for those who are legitimate now.

B.26:  Exactly.  

A.27:  You know, I think,  

B.28:  Well, and, you know, uh, my grandparents came to this country just wanting
a better life, you know --

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- and they got here, but now it's a, you know, it's so strict that you
can't just do [door] that.

A.31:  Right, exactly.  And I think it's important that they, you know, they allow
a good number of people in every year because really they're the ones who work
the hardest and do the jobs that, that we don't want to do.

B.32:  I agree.  

A.33:  And I just, I don't know, I have, personally I have a problem with it, I
think, that, you know, if someone wants to come in and they can prove that
they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that --

B.34:  Exactly.  

A.35:  -- we shouldn't close our door.  

B.36:  If they're not going to be on welfare or, or, or whatever.  They're going
to be a productive citizen Zen.

A.37:  And, you know, I, I believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when,
you, you know, send them back to their country.

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  And, I think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that
we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in and, 

B.40:  Well, think of how many illegal aliens have, have, have been, uh, uh, sent
back to Mexico just to find their way back.

A.41:  Yeah, and that's, that's what I think.  You know, I, I have to laugh
because, like I said, I worked with a lot of those and they'd been deported
two or three times and just basically what they do is they get caught when
they wanted to go home for Christmas.

B.42:  That's right, that's our money.

A.43:  Or for any other time.  

B.44:  Yes, [breathing] that's true.  

A.45:  But, I think, you know, I think all in all there's a lot of improvements.
I think the general idea is good but, but there could be some work done in the
area.

B.46:  I, I think I, I agree.  

A.47:  Well good [laughter].  

B.48:  [Laughter]. 

A.49:  Anyway, do you have anything else in the, the subject, uh -- 

B.50:  Uh, I, uh, boy -- 

A.51:  -- that you might want to talk about?  

B.52:  -- this is spur of the moment, uh, but, I, I don't really see any, any
changes that I think of really blatant right now other than I think they ought
to take, you know, on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a, uh,
political refugee.

A.53:  Yeah, absolutely.  I think a lot of times we take, you know, basically who
we want to because if you, if you have connections, it's a lot easier to get
in.

B.54:  Exactly.  Connections and money.  

A.55:  Yeah, and I think, you know, it should be more of a thing that's based upon
someone's intent, you know.

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  And that it should be equal to all and then not like the United States,
basically, it's not who you know, it d-, it doesn't become a thing of who you
know, but, but how the type of person you are.

B.58:  I agree.  

A.59:  And it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people, like
probably your husband, can get in [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah [laughter].  Well, we got him past that, but, uh, [laughter] --

A.61:  Well, great.  

B.62:  -- I know there's a lot of other people out there,  

A.63:  [Laughter]. 

B.64:  would probably do a good job here.  

@@A.65:  Yep.  Well, let's see, is there anything I believe in [laughter].

B.66:  I think that's it.  Is this like a very short call?  [Laughter].

A.67:  No, I'm not sure how long they're supposed to be, but, I've enjoyed it.
It's good hearing your, your point of view and I think that's neat.  I think
we agree a lot on that and --

B.68:  I did, too.

A.69:  -- I've learned something from it.  

B.70:  [Laughter] Well, it was nice talking to you.  

A.71:  Well, thanks, I'm glad you're home.  You have a good evening, all right?

B.72:  You, too.  

A.73:  Thanks, #bye-bye.#  

B.74:  #Bye.#
