========================================================================

A.1:  Surprised they get anybody this time of day but,  

B.2:  [Laughter].

A.3:  I've been trying all different times,

B.4:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.5:  #but I don't get# anybody at five thirty, don't get anybody at nine at
night so thought,

B.6:  #Oh, well, I'm at,#

A.7:  #I'll try (( )),#

B.8:  work and I just happened to walk back into my office.    

A.9:  #Oh [laughter].# 

B.10:  #I've been# gone for a little while [laughter].

A.11:  Oh.  Well, I go to school so I'm home certain days, 

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.13:  #and, uh,# I really haven't been making any s-, phone calls, have you?
Got,

B.14:  I don't, I haven't ever made any.  I just receive them [laughter]. 

A.15:  Oh [laughter].  Have you, have you received many?  

B.16:  I haven't here lately.  

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  It's, it's, uh, well, the first time we were on this it came just about
every day.

B.20:  #Yeah.#  

A.21:  #I never# had to make one.  They just always came [laughter].

B.22:  Yeah.  Exactly.  

A.23:  People must be tired of it or something.

B.24:  [Laughter]. 

A.25:  W-, well anyway I guess we're supposed to discuss this, uh, subject, what
do you think?  [Laughter].

B.26:  Well, I never gave it any thought myself [laughter].

A.27:  [Laughter]. 

B.28:  I was hoping you could tell me what you thought.  

@A.29:  Oh.  Well, I don't have any objection to people doing that.  I think it
might be good for them.

B.30:  #Uh-huh.#

A.31:  #But# as a mother of two daughters I might be afraid of where they were
sent.

B.32:  #Exactly.#

A.33:  #I'm# just concerned about their safety mor-, 

B.34:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.35:  #because# if they do good work in America they'll probably be sent to a
ghetto [laughter].

B.36:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#  

A.37:  #And if they were# sent to a third world country I couldn't help but wait
worried, you know.

B.38:  Yeah, #yeah.#  

A.39:  #That,# that would be my main objection.  Uh,

B.40:  Uh-huh.  I don't know I think maybe it's, it should stay on a voluntary
basis [laughter].

A.41:  I don't think, it will probably never happen #but,#  

B.42:  #Yeah.# Yeah, I, I think it would be good for, uh, everyone to do something
like that but I, I guess I don't feel like it should be something forced upon
you.

A.43:  Yeah, well it, it probably won't.  

B.44:  #Uh-huh.#

A.45:  #I don't,# I don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway.  We can't, uh --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- seem to pay for all the little things we have going now [laughter].

B.48:  Uh-huh.  

A.49:  That's another consideration [laughter].

B.50:  Exactly [laughter]. 

A.51:  But, uh, I don't know som-, some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a
real eye opener, you know [laughter].

B.52:  [Laughter] Really [laughter]. 

A.53:  I mean, sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here and they just
see some really tiny modest wood frame homes and then they think, they're just
kind of shocked at that side of town, you know [laughter].

B.54:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  I probably lived in one of those when I was a little girl [laughter].

B.56:  [Laughter] I have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking
things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and
let him get a taste of that #for a while [laughter].#

A.57:  #Oh [laughter].# Well that would be an eye opener, wouldn't it?

B.58:  Wouldn't it though?

A.59:  I mean right next to us is such a pitiful country.  

B.60:  Uh-huh, it is.  

A.61:  I know.  Sometimes I wish we'd help them out instead of going all across
the world,

B.62:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.63:  #and# helping some countries I never even heard of.  

B.64:  Uh-huh.  I know it.  

A.65:  It seems to me we are, it would be to our benefit to strengthen that
country.

B.66:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.67:  Right on our borders.  

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  But, what do I know, right?   [Laughter]. 

B.70:  [Laughter]. 

A.71:  I'm just sitting at home and,  

B.72:  [Laughter]. 

A.73:  and, uh, doing laundry today and certainly not up, nobody has called me
from Washington [laughter].

B.74:  [Laughter]. 

@@A.75:  Oh, but, uh, anyway, how did you get on this program?  

B.76:  I work at T I.  

A.77:  Oh, you do work at T I?  Oh, you're in Lewisville.

B.78:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.79:  #Oh, yeah.# I just went by that place.  We were going to a football playoff
game a week or so ago which we lost and, uh [laughter], 

B.80:  [Laughter]. 

A.81:  we went by.  That's the first time I'd seen it.  It looked really nice.

B.82:  Yeah.  

A.83:  A lot of trees there.  It looked like a pretty little, a sight.

B.84:  Hang on a minute.

A.85:  Sure.

B.86:  {Talks to someone in the background}.  No, I don't think so, Yeah, Patty
might.  I'm back.

A.87:  Oh, sure.  #Di-,#

B.88:  #But# how did you get on it?  

A.89:  Well, my husband works at T I over on Central.  

B.90:  Oh.  

A.91:  Uh, why we're living in Arlington I'm not so sure but, 

B.92:  [Laughter]. 

A.93:  he works over there and tha-, we did it last time.  

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  And, uh, so I'm, just my daughter and I are registered this time.  I don't
know, they didn't even ask him back [laughter].

B.96:  Really?  

A.97:  That was weird, wasn't it?

B.98:  Huh.  

A.99:  But like I said I hardly ever get any calls this time.  

B.100:  Uh-huh.  #I don't get too many.# 

A.101:  #And I can never find# anybody.

B.102:  Huh.

A.103:  So, um,

B.104:  The first time I used to get calls from far away too.  

A.105:  Right.  

B.106:  Like Maryland, 

A.107:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.108:  #and# New Jersey, and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort
Worth area that I get calls from.

A.109:  Yeah, I've had the same experiences,

B.110:  #Uh-huh.#

A.111:  #all# right around here.  

B.112:  Uh-huh.  

A.113:  Yeah, I don't know, uh, I wonder if they really, I don't know if they could
possibly teach a machine to recognize all the different accents.

B.114:  [Laughter].

A.115:  There's just, there's so many with this one town --

B.116:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  

A.117:  -- you know.  

B.118:  [Laughter]. 

A.119:  E-, even in some families some people talk a little bit different.

B.120:  Oh, yeah.  #Yeah.# 

A.121:  #My husband is# from New Jersey and one of his sisters does things that
really sound funny to me and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way, and
that's one family, right?  [Laughter].

B.122:  [Laughter].

A.123:  Of course, I think everybody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny but
[laughter],

B.124:  [Laughter] Oh, I agree.  

A.125:  You know, how that goes [laughter]. 

B.126:  [Laughter] #Oh, shoot.#

A.127:  #Oh, God.# Well, I'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet.
Sometimes she says ((at night.))

B.128:  Yeah.  

A.129:  Or, or switc-, or overloads so please end your conversation. 

B.130:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.#

A.131:  #Right.#  

B.132:  [Laughter]. 

A.133:  Well, do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject?  [Laughter].

B.134:  No, I sure don't [laughter].

A.135:  You don't have any kids you want to send over here?  [Laughter].

B.136:  [Laughter]  No, no kids [laughter].

A.137:  Well, (( )) is [laughter]. 

B.138:  [Laughter]  #Oh, shoot.#

A.139:  #Well, uh,# I don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto.
Well, one of them is real idealistic, she might [laughter].

B.140:  [Laughter] My sister is, I'd be more ((suited to)) that than her she's
just bugs,
