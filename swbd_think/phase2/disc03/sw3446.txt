A.1:  Uh, do you golf yourself, or are you a spectator?  

B.2:  Well, no, I, I try [laughter].  

A.3:  You try.   

B.4:  My husband and I, uh, took it up last year -- 

A.5:  Oh. 

B.6:  -- last summer so, we try and it, it, we really enjoy it.  

A.7:  Do you?  

B.8:  We're having a, having a good time although, it can be rather frustrating
[laughter].

A.9:  [Laughter]. 

B.10:  How about you?  

A.11:  Did you take a class or did you just start?  

B.12:  Uh, we took a golf clinic.  

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  There was about, I don't know, twelve, fifteen people in it. 

A.15:  Oh. 

B.16:  And we took lesson for about seven weeks.  

A.17:  Oh, that's,  

B.18:  We went once a week and, and that's how we got started.  

A.19:  Well, that's probably helped a lot.  

B.20:  Yes.  

A.21:  I'm more of I spectator.  I, I have been a couple of times with my husband,
but I, uh, I'm more of a spectator.  My relatives have a cabin and it's right
on the fifteenth hole of a golf course.

B.22:  Oh, how nice.  

A.23:  It is, and we just love to sit and watch the, the people golf.  It's, it's
fun [laughter].

B.24:  Uh-huh [laughter].  

A.25:  To see them, I, I enjoy looking at, noticing different golf courses and the
way they're set out, you know.

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  The, the layout and, are some of them harder than others or,  

B.28:  Oh, yeah, definitely [laughter].  

A.29:  Do they have, so they, do they name the golf courses like this is a, you
know, beginning one, intermediate or, 

B.30:  You know, I've never really heard of it, but they do something called the
slope rating --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- and I'm not into it that much to really know, but I think that has
something to do with how easy or how hard the course is.

A.33:  Oh. 

B.34:  Uh, my dad has talked about it and I'm just kind of like, okay, whatever
[laughter].

A.35:  [Laughter].  

B.36:  So, I'm not really sure I know, but I think that's how they rate the, the
different courses.

A.37:  Oh, so now, when you go, do you take a caddy or do you, do you just go
yourself or, 

B.38:  Oh, no, we go ourselves.  A lot of time we'll walk just to -- 

A.39:  Oh. 

B.40:  -- get in the exercise.  

A.41:  Uh-huh.  

B.42:  Uh, depending on how the weather is, if it's too hot or something --

A.43:  Uh-huh.   

B.44:  -- then we'll, then we'll ride, but we, we just like, you know, getting
outdoors and --

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  -- and walking around and playing.  

A.47:  Spending the time together probably.  

B.48:  Yes, and that's something that, that's a sport that a husband and wife
could do together.

A.49:  Oh, yeah.  

B.50:  So we, we, you ought to take it up, it really is a lot of fun [laughter].

A.51:  It looks fun and it doesn't look that difficult.  I mean, I'm sure that's
what everybody says that hasn't tried it [laughter].

B.52:  Yeah, well, you know, you sit there and watch the pros on T V and it's
like, oh, they make it look so easy --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- and you're going, oh, I can go out and do that.  

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  And then you get out there and it's kind of a different story [laughter].

A.57:  Oh, well, that's what I noticed [noise] the golf course that we watch most
of the time they have, you know, the sand traps and the little lakes and
there's a, a river going through the middle of it and the trees and --

B.58:  Yeah.  

A.59:  -- I think, boy, I, in fact, we do find a lot of golf balls [laughter].

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  

A.61:  Along the side of the road that have been hit off, you know, and --

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  -- and, that's fun.  We enjoy walking, looking for the golf, golf balls.
Now, how long does it take to, to, to play a round of golf?

B.64:  Usually, if you're going to play eighteen holes, it usually takes about
four hours.

A.65:  Oh. 

B.66:  A lot of times, uh, you know, you've got groups in front of you and
sometimes you have to wait --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- and, and that kind of thing, so, it, you know, it can take, take a long
time.

A.69:  Do you usually play the full eighteen rounds, or do you just do the nine?

B.70:  Sometimes we do nine.  It just kind of depends if we decide to go out, you
know, in the afternoon --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- and just want to go and play nine, then we'll do that, but usually we
play eighteen.

A.73:  Oh, so would you recommend taking a class before you just go out on the
course and try and, 

B.74:  Yeah, probably so, just so that, you know, you know the courtesy and --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- and get at least the basics down so you feel a little bit confident
because I know the first time I went out to play, I waited till I took all the
lessons --

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- and I was, I was so embarrassed because I thought, oh, I'm going to be
holding people up behind me, 

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  and they're going to be laughing and,  

A.81:  [Laughter]. 

B.82:  you know, you just, I guess you just get nervous.  

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  And then after you've been out a few times you just say, oh, well
[laughter].

A.85:  [Laughter]. 

B.86:  Kind of get used to it.  

A.87:  So, do you have your own clubs or do you,  

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  You each have your own set of clubs.  

B.90:  Yeah, we each have our own clubs [noise].  When we took our lessons, the
instructor provided clubs for us because, which was really good because, you
know, when year just starting out, you don't know what type of clubs to use,
you know --

A.91:  Yeah.  

B.92:  -- what's the best for you and so there's no sense in buying a set --

A.93:  No.  

B.94:  -- and then finding out later that you really should be using something
else.

A.95:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's, my husband, he took a class in college and he really
enjoyed it and --

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  -- I've since thought about buying him some clubs but I don't know the
first thing about it, you know.

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  And I wouldn't even know where to begin.  

B.100:  Well, you can go to, you know, a golf shop or something.  That's what we
did when we went to go --

A.101:  Oh. 

B.102:  -- look for them and they helped us out a lot.  

A.103:  Oh, to tell you the lengths to get and -- 

B.104:  Yeah.  

A.105:  -- and the different type of, oh.  

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  Well, that's interesting, huh.  

B.108:  So that, that helps [laughter].  

A.109:  Boy, I'll say, yeah, because I, like I say, I don't even know where to,
where to start, what to do, but I guess that's, I'm sure there's books and
[noise] --

B.110:  Yeah.  

A.111:  -- on golf that you could read, too, so.  

B.112:  Yeah.  

A.113:  So, do you have a favorite course that you usually go to or do you, 

B.114:  Well, we have, we have one, that, it's not our favorite one, but it's,
