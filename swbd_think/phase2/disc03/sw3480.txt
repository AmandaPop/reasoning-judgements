A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  Okay.  Um, well, actually I don't really cook [laughter].

A.3:  You don't?

B.4:  Um, I'm, I'm still a student in college, and --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- um, I'm fortunate to have my mom cook dinners for me.  So,
I'm not, not very experienced --

A.7:  Okay, I --

B.8:  -- because, uh. 

A.9:  -- I'm a single parent so I, --

B.10:  [Laughter].

A.11:  -- I guess I have to do a lot of cooking for my son and I.

B.12:  Oh, yeah.  Um.  Well, I have cooked like, small dinners, like
just hamburgers [laughter] and things like that and can foods
that you just heat up.  Nothing great though.

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  So.

A.15:  Okay, well, I was born in, in Louisiana, my dad was
Portuguese and my mother was Italian, so I can, I'm familiar
with, you know, some Cajun food, Italian, Portuguese food.

B.16:  Oh, Cajun food's really good.  I've had that before in, uh,
Mississippi --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- New Orleans, that's it.  Yeah, I've, I've had all kinds of
different foods.  I travel a lot, but [laughter] never cooked it
myself. 

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  So.

A.21:  Yeah, you all have some pretty good cheese up there don't
you.

B.22:  Pardon me?

A.23:  Say, you all have a lot of good cheeses up there, (( )).

B.24:  Cheeses?

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  Yeah.  That's right.

A.27:  Yeah, I kind of miss that up Dallas, (( )) that Portuguese
and Italian blood in me, and I kind of miss the cheeses --

B.28:  Oh, yeah.

A.29:  -- because in, in Dallas, only get a bunch of domestic stuff,
you know.

B.30:  Oh, I love Italian food though --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- probably my favorite kind of food --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- is Italian food.  I don't think I've ever had Portuguese
food.

A.35:  Well, it's mostly, they eat a lot stews and soups and stuff.

B.36:  What is that?  It's?

A.37:  A lot of stew and soup.

B.38:  Oh.

A.39:  They, they boil, you know, they boil or broil a lot of their
food.

B.40:  Oh, okay.

A.41:  And it, it's kind of like Spanish, except it's not quite as
spicy as the Spanish food.

B.42:  Oh, yeah.

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  Um.  I like Mexican food --

A.45:  Yeah --

B.46:  -- a real lot.

A.47:  -- yeah, the Mexicans, they, the Mexicans use a lot of hot
peppers, where the Portuguese use a lot of more garlic and stuff,
than the hot --

B.48:  Oh, really?

A.49:  -- than the spicy food.

B.50:  Oh.  So what do you like to make for you and your son?

A.51:  Uh, I look to cook spaghetti the kind that you cook the sauce
for about three hours --

B.52:  Oh, really?

A.53:  -- so it's real thick and all.

B.54:  Uh, my parents make their own sauce.  Yeah --

A.55:  Yeah.

B.56:  -- it's really good.

A.57:  Yeah, I don't, I don't think I can go the, the jar stuff
[laughter] after being spoiled by the real stuff.

B.58:  Um.

A.59:  And my son cooks a little bit.  He's sixteen.  He usually has
supper cooked when I come home during the day, so.

B.60:  Oh, that's great, that's --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- really good.  I wish I would have [throat_clearing] cooked
more when I was in high school.

A.63:  Yeah.  We're, we're both in Boy Scouts.  We learned to, you
know, cook out over open fire in the woods and all.

B.64:  Oh, that's great, that's good to know.  

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  Sure it comes handy.

A.67:  Yeah, and you know, like to cook Cajun food when I, when I
can get the seafood.  It's kind of expensive in Dallas.

B.68:  Oh, yeah, I bet.  Yeah.

A.69:  But sometimes, we had, see we went into one of the grocery
stores the other day and they had, uh, Cajun blackened shark --

B.70:  Oh, wow.

A.71:  -- and I tasted it, and it taste pretty good.  And the shark
was on sale, so I bought some and the first time I'd eaten
shark, and cooked in it.  Turned out real good.

B.72:  Oh, that's good.  Um.  I've never had shark [laughter].

A.73:  [Laughter].

B.74:  (( )).

A.75:  First time for me, and I didn't know how, I didn't know
whether or not to eat it, but I sampled it and it was, it was all
right.

B.76:  Well, that's good.  I like seafood, but I hardly ever have
it.  I haven't eaten it in a long time.

A.77:  Yeah.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  Well, you, you live on campus, or?

B.80:  [Throat_clearing] Um, I used to.  I used to live in the dorm
for two years, but then I came back home.  I went to, uh,
University of Ma-, Madison, so when you, when you eat in the
dorms, you know, there's a big cafeteria, they have the food --

A.81:  Yeah. 

B.82:  -- already prepared for you.

A.83:  Right.

B.84:  So I didn't, I didn't get a chance to cook much, and now that
I'm home, my mom's home, so she [laughter] cooks, and.

A.85:  [Laughter].

B.86:  But, I, I do, I make some things, you know, once in a while,
you know, get hungry enough you're going to cook for yourself [laughter].

A.87:  [Laughter] Right.

B.88:  I'm still, I'd like to learn, you know, I, it's, I like to
bake, I make cakes and cookies and things.

A.89:  Oh, you do?

B.90:  Yeah, I can do that, but.

A.91:  Okay, I'm not very good at baking, I --

B.92:  Oh. 

A.93:  -- you know --

B.94:  Oh, yeah.

A.95:  -- good at cooking the main dishes.

B.96:  Oh.  Well, I, I'd like to learn how.  It's one of my goals [laughter].  
I'm sure I will once I move out on my own.

A.97:  Yeah.  When I was living with my mother, she, she tried to
teach me how to cook, and I wasn't interested then --

B.98:  See, I'm not, neither.

A.99:  -- and then, once I moved out I miss her good food, and I
don't know how to cook it, so I'm constantly looking up recipes
or try to cook what I remember eating when I was small and wished
I'd, you know, I'd learned from her.

B.100:  Yeah, yeah.  I should start doing that.  It takes a lot of
time, though, doesn't it.

A.101:  Yes, it does.  Course my mother never followed recipes.  You
know, she just cooked to taste.  I guess most good cooks do that
anyway.

B.102:  Oh, yeah.

A.103:  They just add a little bit of that, and a little bit of this,
and it comes [laughter] out,
