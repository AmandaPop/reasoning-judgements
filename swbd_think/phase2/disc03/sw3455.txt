======================================================================

A.1:  Okay, uh, I guess our topic is about movies -- 

@B.2:  Uh-huh.  

A.3:  -- and, uh, what is coincidence, we got a baby-sitter and we went to the
movies that past weekend.

B.4:  Oh, so did I [laughter].  

A.5:  [Laughter]  And we saw CAPE FEAR.  

B.6:  Oh, I heard that was excellent.  

A.7:  It is.  

B.8:  Is it?  

A.9:  It's really good.  

B.10:  Uh, I wanted to see that [noise].  I was deciding between that and, uh, MY
GIRL and, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.

A.11:  Oh, how was that?  

B.12:  Oh, it was excellent.  It was a really, really good movie.  I'd recommend
it.

A.13:  I heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.  Is that
true? [/Noise].

B.14:  Uh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.

A.15:  Oh. 

B.16:  [Noise] Uh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.

A.17:  Oh. 

B.18:  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know, though, I, I've heard that, and then what you just
told me so,

A.19:  Yeah, yeah, because, uh, the little boy dies.  

B.20:  Right, yeah.  

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  It was sad.  It was really sad.  

A.23:  Oh. 

B.24:  But, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl,
deals with his death --

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  -- and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.

A.27:  Oh.  

B.28:  Maybe.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  But, it was really good.  It was sad, very sad.  

A.31:  [Static]  Oh, I want to see that one.  

B.32:  [Laughter].  

A.33:  Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  It was really suspenseful.  So that, that's, that's a real good movie to
see.

B.36:  I heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent, but it was kind
of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.

A.37:  Uh, no, and it, uh, it was kind of, I don't know, it's kind of both, I
guess, but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

B.38:  Oh, really?  

A.39:  But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.  

B.40:  Oh. 

A.41:  And it, it was a real good movie.  And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
[laughter].

B.42:  Oh, yeah.  

A.43:  Because we have two kids.  

B.44:  Uh.  

A.45:  And FIEVEL GOES WEST [laughter].  

B.46:  Oh, I've seen, uh, [lipsmack] previews for them [laughter] on T V, but
[laughter] I,

A.47:  [Laughter]  But, uh, those were, those were okay, so,   

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  And then, oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the
movies, but I, we've rented some videos.

B.50:  Oh, yeah, I like to rent movies, too.  

A.51:  And I think the last one I rented was, uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS --

B.52:  Oh. 

A.53:  -- with Demi Moore.

B.54:  Oh, I, I didn't see that.  

A.55:  And, uh, that, that, that's okay.  That's pretty good.  

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  Oh, and, uh, WHAT ABOUT BOB?  

B.58:  I have seen that -- 

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  -- at the theatres, yeah.  

A.61:  Yeah, we rented that one.  

B.62:  That, that was cute.  

A.63:  And, uh, uh, I guess that's about it.  Have you rented any movies lately?

B.64:  Uh, [lipsmack] the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox
and, uh,

A.65:  Oh, yeah, that was good.  We rented that one, too.  

B.66:  Yeah, I liked that.  I like Michael J. Fox a lot.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  [Laughter]. 

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  He's one of my favorites.   

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  I like his movies.  

A.73:  So, do you go to the movies often, or,  

B.74:  No, not too often.  I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time
--

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- since last weekend.  But, uh, there's been movies out that I've been
wanting to see.  I just, you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them.

A.77:  Yeah, yeah, well, we have two little kids, so it's hard for us to get out
and go to the movies.  We have to [breathing] dig up a baby-sitter and
[laughter],

B.78:  Oh [laughter] I see. 

A.79:  And that's only the only time we can go out, so [child_yelling], our time
is scarce.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  [Laughter].  

B.82:  Oh. 

A.83:  But, uh, [child_yelling] we, we, we t-, we, you know, we're, we're big
movie people and --

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  -- we try and do and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen
on T V that was real good.  Uh,

B.86:  Oh, I watched that movie with, uh, [lipsmack] Barbara, uh, uh, what was her
name.  Oh, Bar-, that, uh, her sister got killed and, uh, [lipsmack] she had a
baby.  The husband was a dentist and he had murdered her.

A.87:  Oh, yeah, uh, 

B.88:  That was, that was pretty good. 

A.89:  Bertinelli, or what's her name.  

B.90:  Yeah, uh-huh, oh, Valerie Bertinelli.  

A.91:  I can't,   

B.92:  That's it, yeah.  

A.93:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [laughter].  Yeah, that was real good, I saw that
one, uh, two part series, and I heard it was a true story.

B.94:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

A.95:  Yeah, I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too. 

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  And, and then I saw that other movie about, uh, MOTHER, DAUGHT-, MOTHER,
WIFE, MURDERER.  Did you see that one?

B.98:  Oh, uh, with, uh, Judith Light?  

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  Uh,  

A.101:  Did you see that one, that was, was really good.  That was supposed to be a
true story, too.

B.102:  Yeah, I did see that.  Yeah, I did.  That was on a while ago, wasn't it?

A.103:  Yeah.  

B.104:  Yeah, I saw that.  

A.105:  Guess a couple weeks ago or something like that.  

B.106:  Yeah, that was pretty good.  

A.107:  Boy --

B.108:  I, 

A.109:  -- we have [laughter], 

B.110:  [Laughter].

A.111:  we, we see all the same movies.  

B.112:  Yeah.  I like, uh, the true stories.  

A.113:  Yeah.  

B.114:  They're more interesting.  

A.115:  Uh-huh.  

B.116:  And it's hard to believe that, you know, this really happened. 

A.117:  I know.  

B.118:  Some of them are pretty bad.  

A.119:  Yeah, yeah. 

B.120:  But,  

A.121:  Huh.  Well [laughter],  

B.122:  [Laughter]. 

A.123:  We sure do have a lot in common.  

B.124:  Yeah.  

A.125:  If you're ever in town, we'll go see a movie [laughter].  

B.126:  Okay [laughter].  

A.127:  But, and we don't really, d-, do you all have, do you all still have
drive-ins up there or,

B.128:  Yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah, do you have them there? 

A.129:  Um, well, we may have just a couple over here.
