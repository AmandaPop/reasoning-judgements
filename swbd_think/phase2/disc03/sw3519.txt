A.1:  What kind of hobbies do you have?  

@B.2:  [Breathing] Well, [breathing] mostly, uh, sports, I would guess.  A
little bit of golf, uh, I play racquetball, uh, twice a week at a local club
here.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  

B.4:  Uh, gardening I like to do a little bit.  How about yourself? 

A.5:  Well, I collect, uh, antique glassware.  

B.6:  Oh, really?  

A.7:  So I like hitting the antique shows and -- 

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  -- and, uh, collecting.  I particularly like, uh, antique pitchers and my
husband is interested in those, too.

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  And, uh, so we do that, and, uh, I play a lot of bridge.  That's kind of a
hobby.

B.12:  Now that's something I've never done is played bridge.  I'd like to try
that sometime.

A.13:  [Laughter]  Well, we lived in a, a small town in Oklahoma -- 

B.14:  Uh-huh.  

A.15:  -- for a while, and that was the major entertainment.  In fact, that was
about the only entertainment --

B.16:  Is that right?  

A.17:  -- other than gossiping [laughter] about people [laughter].  

B.18:  [Laughter]. 

A.19:  So that's where I learned it and then I stayed with it.  And don't play as
much of it now as, as I used to because I work --

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  -- now and, uh, stuff, but I do enjoy that.  

B.22:  Well, I've seen columns in the newspapers where they say if this is your
hand, this is how, 

A.23:  [Laughter]. 

B.24:  you should play them and it looks like it's a little more to it than,
than most people give it credit for, I guess.

A.25:  Yeah, it can be, it can be very detailed and if you're playing with someone
that is really serious, I mean, you can't talk, you can't bat an eye --

B.26:  Oh. 

A.27:  -- you can't do anything, you know.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And, uh, uh, I play in a group, that we've been playing together now about
seventeen years here --

B.30:  Oh, is that right?  

A.31:  -- in Texas [laughter] and, uh, it,  

B.32:  You ought to know each others moves by now, huh?  

A.33:  [Laughter]  Yeah, well, what's funny is we started out that, it used to be
that we started playing at seven thirty and we played till midnight and we
played bridge.  Now we get together and we finally start bridge about eight or
eight thirty, we play for an hour and then we stop and talk and have dessert
[laughter].

B.34:  Oh [laughter].  Well -- 

A.35:  Shows our age.  

B.36:  -- never hurts to have a little refreshment involved, too.  

A.37:  [Laughter]  Right.  Well, it shows our age.  We have to be home by ten
anymore [laughter].

B.38:  [Laughter] Well,  

A.39:  I said, you'd think that we were seventy years old [laughter]. 

B.40:  [Laughter] Yeah, I, you seem, you slow down.  There is no doubt about it.
I, I can --

A.41:  Oh, yeah.  

B.42:  -- see a change in my life.  

A.43:  Well, I know that you, as you get older, uh, and that you're working and
are involved with families and grandchildren and stuff --

B.44:  Uh-huh.  

A.45:  -- it just seems like that,  

B.46:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.47:  you know, you have to have some rest.  

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  So, uh [noise],  

B.50:  You say you're in Richardson, is that right?  

A.51:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.52:  I'm, uh, I've been to Dallas a time or two.  In fact I have a, a sister
that lives there.

@@A.53:  Oh, do you?  

B.54:  She lives in Plano. 

A.55:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.56:  And the, uh, the software vendor for the company I work for is
headquartered in Richardson.

A.57:  Oh, what, uh,  

B.58:  CompuTrac is there,  

A.59:  Uh-huh, yes.  

B.60:  You know where their offices are?  

A.61:  Yeah, I, I, I think I -- 

B.62:  I think it's next -- 

A.63:  -- have,  

B.64:  -- to a car dealership if I remember right.  

A.65:  Yeah, it seems like I have passed it.  Uh,  

B.66:  It's on Municipal Drive.  

A.67:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  #Over on about the same side.# 

B.70:  #But that's a nice area.#  

A.71:  Yeah, it is, we, we enjoy it very much.  Is, uh, your, uh, sister married
to a Bird?

B.72:  No, his name is White.  He works for, uh, Penney's.  

A.73:  White, okay.  

B.74:  They have a big plant there.  

A.75:  Because I know that there is a Professor Bird here has gotten, uh, a lot of
people in Utah signed up on the program.

B.76:  Oh, is that right?  

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Uh-huh.  

A.79:  I'm familiar with it because I, uh, I work on the day, I work on this
project for T I.  I'm a contract person --

B.80:  Oh. 

A.81:  -- and, uh, so, you know, I'm familiar with some of the names that come
through and, and areas and stuff.

B.82:  Well, as you can probably guess, my sister is the one that let us know
about it.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  Where she lives in that area, she,  

A.85:  Are, are you enjoying the program?  

B.86:  Oh, actually this is the first call I've placed.  I've, uh, well, not
placed but received, uh, we just got our letters this, uh, Wednesday, I
guess, or --

A.87:  Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.   

B.88:  -- Tuesday that was, yesterday.  

A.89:  Oh, yeah.  

B.90:  But it's, it's, uh, sounds like it's kind of a fun thing.  

A.91:  Yeah, I think you'll enjoy it.  I think you'll enjoy talking to different
people, you know, over the United States and, uh, it's kind of interesting.
It's interesting to hear other people's points of view and, and kind of get
acquainted with them and, 

B.92:  Yeah, have you, uh, uh, talked to people from all over the place or, 

A.93:  Yeah, I've talked to, uh, someone in Washington, D C and -- 

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  -- Pennsylvania and Ohio and, uh, I think I've talked to three people in
Utah.  One in, in Provo, uh, a young lady is a student up there.

B.96:  Uh-huh.  

A.97:  And a wife and now you and then, course, a bunch of them from Texas --

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  -- area and, uh,  

B.100:  Uh, that's where the bulk of the participants are, I would guess.

A.101:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Uh,  

B.102:  How critical is it that they keep on, on the topic?  Is that, they're
really #trying to read voices.#

A.103:  #Well, actually, uh,# they're using me as a target caller and I'm really
supposed to keep us on [laughter] the target.

B.104:  Are you [laughter]?  

A.105:  And as you can see, we have not been on it [laughter].  

B.106:  Kind of wandered [laughter].  

A.107:  Some of,  

B.108:  Why is, why is that, though, you know, why?  

A.109:  Uh, because they use it in the research and, and they study voice 
patterns --

B.110:  Uh-huh.  

A.111:  -- so, like, they take all the topics on say, hobbies and then they'll
study these voice patterns.

B.112:  Oh. 

A.113:  And, to, you know, to see the different way p-, ways people will say
certain words and things, you know.  And,

B.114:  Oh, because they think with vocab-, with hobbies there is going to be a
certain vocabulary.

A.115:  Yes, right.  

B.116:  I see.  

A.117:  Correct and, uh, so, uh -- 

B.118:  Huh.  

A.119:  -- tomorrow if my boss hears this, he's going to say, Nancy, you didn't
stay on the topic [laughter].

B.120:  [Laughter]  Well, that's my fault.  

A.121:  And I record this, I will listen to our conversation tomorrow as it is --

B.122:  Oh. 

A.123:  -- coming over a data base and I'm putting it on a cassette and then I have
