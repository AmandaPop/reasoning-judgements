A.1:   Okay, d-, do you work outside the home, or [noise],  

B.2:   I do.  

A.3:   are you a student?  

B.4:   I, #I'm a student# -- 

A.5:   #You're a student.#

B.6:   -- and I work at Nu Skin, so,   

A.7:   Oh, okay.  So you have a wardrobe to choose.  

B.8:   Yes [laughter].  

A.9:   [Laughter]  Do you wear more dressy type clothes or casual
[baby] or,   

B.10:   Uh, we're allowed to wear, we, we just can't wear jeans.  

A.11:   Uh-huh.  

B.12:   Uh, every [baby], Monday through Friday we just have to wear,
you know, nice slacks or -- 

A.13:   Uh-huh.  

B.14:   -- uh, just something that looks nice and then on Fridays and
Saturdays we can wear jeans so,   

A.15:   Oh, oh.  

B.16:   Like jean day [laughter].  

A.17:   So does your, does it change pretty much, from does it change
from season to season or is it pretty standard?  

B.18:   Uh, it's pretty standard.  I mean, just more sweaters and
stuff -- 

A.19:   Uh-huh.  

B.20:   -- of course, in the winter, but,  

A.21:   Well, it seems like, you know, even in the winter you go from
your warm car to your warm building, so there really isn't that
much of a, of a difference -- 

B.22:   Right.  

A.23:   -- or in the summer it's, it's mostly air-conditioning. 
Course [noise], you do wear cooler things.  But I, uh, don't work
outside the home right now.  I have four little ones and so my -- 

B.24:   Oh, uh,  

A.25:   -- my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours
[laughter], but, uh, you know, mostly during the day I wear the,
the casual type things and, and I have the sweaters and the, in the
winter and fall and -- 

B.26:   Uh-huh.  

A.27:   -- and cooler things in the summer, but I, [lipsmack], for my
husband, he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so
climatized, his work situation, but we've just recently done
something that we found really helpful with his wardrobe and that
is, uh, we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry
cleaners.  And we hadn't been doing this previously.  I was, you
know -- 

B.28:   Oh, really?  

A.29:   -- washing them and ironing and taking care of them at home,
and we found that it makes them wear and look so much better to
have [baby] just everything dry cleaned.  I don't know whether
you,  

B.30:   And you don't find that gets too expensive or,  

A.31:   Well, we, uh, figure it's pretty much worth the expense
[laughter].  

B.32:   Really.  

A.33:   Just because, uh, the, the dry cleaner comes right to his
place of work and picks the articles up and takes them and dry
cleans them and brings them back the next day and then they give
the company a fifteen percent discount.  So it really -- 

B.34:   Wow.  

A.35:   -- it really is not that expensive and we figure, you know,
what it saves on wear and tear and then, [baby_crying] and saving
me having to do it and they look so much better when they're dry
cleaned -- 

B.36:   Uh-huh.  

A.37:   -- than when I do, so that,  

B.38:   That makes it really nice.  

A.39:   It does, it does, and that's kind of a, a, j-, just a, you
know, thing we've recently started that, that we found really
helpful.  

B.40:   Uh-huh.  Does he have to wear suits and ties and,  

A.41:   No, he doesn't.  He, he wears, if he has an, a meeting or an
important thing, he wears a suit and tie, but most of the time it's
just dress slacks and, and, you know, white shirt usually, and a
tie.  

B.42:   Um.  

A.43:   So, that, now that's interesting.  Do you wear, when, on the
days that, like Monday through Friday, do you wear slacks mostly or
dresses or,   

B.44:   Uh, I, I rarely wear dresses [laughter].  

A.45:   Do you [laughter]?  

B.46:   Yeah. I mean it doesn't,  

A.47:   You're not a dress person [laughter].  

B.48:   It doesn't have to be that dressy.  

A.49:   Uh-huh.

B.50:   Guys have to wear ties at work, but -- 

A.51:   Oh. 

B.52:   -- shirts and ties at Nu Skin, but, other than that,  

A.53:   Uh-huh.  Even, even during the week they do, or, I mean, on
weekends, do they?  

B.54:   Oh, no, no, no.  

A.55:   Not on the weekend.  

B.56:   But, uh, the guys seem to get to have to dress up a little
more than the girls.  

A.57:   Oh. 

B.58:   For some reason.  

A.59:   Oh. 

B.60:   We can get away with more [laughter].  

A.61:   What about like shoe type things.  Do you wear mostly dress
shoes or do you wear tennis shoes or what?  

B.62:   Uh, no, we can't wear tennis shoes -- 

A.63:   Oh. 

B.64:   -- during the week either.  

A.65:   Well, I guess you couldn't because you wouldn't have jeans on
[laughter].  

B.66:   Yeah, we can't wear tennis shoes.  But, I, it's pretty casual. 
I, I found, I mean, it would be what I would wear to school 
anyways -- 

A.67:   Oh. 

B.68:   -- most of the time.  So,  

A.69:   So, can you wear right what you wear to school to work, you
don't have to change?  

B.70:   Yeah, yeah.  

A.71:   Well, that's,  

B.72:   I, well, I work in the mornings from six thirty to ten thirty,
so -- 

A.73:   Oh. 

B.74:   -- I get up pretty early --  

A.75:   Uh-huh.  

B.76:   -- and then school comes after that.  So I just don't bother
to change for school, unless I really want to be casual [laughter]. 

A.77:   Oh. 

B.78:   But,  

A.79:   Oh, well, that's interesting.  Okay, well, can you,  

@@B.80:   How long have you been doing this T I?  

A.81:   Uh, let's see, about two weeks is all.  

B.82:   Really?  How did you find out about it?  

A.83:   Uh, my brother.  

B.84:   He's in, is he in Dallas?  

A.85:   He, yes, well, he's in Plano.  That's just outside Dallas.  

B.86:   Oh, really?   

A.87:   Yeah.  

B.88:   That's where I'm from.  

A.89:   Oh, are you?  

B.90:   Yeah.  

A.91:   Is Plano.  

B.92:   Yeah.  Uh, what is, is he in a ward down there, or,  

A.93:   Yeah, uh, I wonder, should we wait until she comes on and, and
disconnects us to talk about all this or,   

B.94:   Sure [laughter].  

A.95:   [Laughter] Okay.  Let me just, should we finish, let me just
ask you a couple more things about clothes and then I'll -- 

B.96:   Okay.  

A.97:   -- and then she should be on.  Uh, [breathing] oh, what was
I going to,  

B.98:   [Laughter]. 

A.99:   [Laughter] Do you, do you like, do you wear suits or do you
like more, more feminine type dresses [noise]?  

B.100:   Uh, I [noise], I like, yeah, I'm more into suits, I think. 
I'm more, uh,  

A.101:   That style, huh.  

B.102:   Yeah, more, what's it called, just [noise], uh,  

A.103:   Tailored.  

B.104:   Yeah, and, oh, what's the word, [laughter] I can't think of
the word.  It's, uh, [noise] things that don't,
