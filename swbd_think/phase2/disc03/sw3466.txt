B.1:  Okay.

A.2:  Okay.  What kind of music are you interested in?  

@B.3:  I'm basically into, uh, oh, just rock and roll.

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  Uh, j-, I'm a little bit of everything, jazz, reggae, rock, uh, 

A.6:  Uh-huh, so,  

B.7:  I'm one of the, I'm twenty-three, so, you know, I used to be in a band and
hang around all that stuff.

A.8:  Oh. 

B.9:  But I'm pretty much into, more classic rock, now probably.  

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  You know, Clapton, Lynyrd Skynyrd.  

A.12:  Oh.  Who,  

B.13:  But, I'm also into, you know, jazz and stuff.  

A.14:  Uh-huh, so you like the hits of today.  You're not really interested into
[laughter],

B.15:  I'm not into, uh, the dance stuff, uh,  

A.16:  Uh-huh.  Oh, 

B.17:  So, what are you into right now?  

A.18:  Well, well one of my favorite things is, is this time of the year is
Christmas music.  I love Christmas music [laughter].

B.19:  Uh-huh.  

A.20:  All kinds, I like, the, you know, the, the children's songs like FROSTY THE
SNOWMAN and, course, I have children, so they like that, too.

B.21:  Right.  

A.22:  And I like, also like the, you know, the religious type Christmas songs and
I just love the, the music this time of the, the year.  And I also, I like
country, a little bit of country.  You probably don't like country.

B.23:  Uh,  

A.24:  Sounds like [laughter].  

B.25:  I like some Clint Black, you know, some Garth, uh,   

A.26:  Do you?  

B.27:  Yeah, I've gotten into that more lately -- 

A.28:  Oh. 

B.29:  -- the last few years.  I, I used to just totally not even listen to it,
but, 

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  All my friends are into it, so, you know -- 

A.32:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.33:  -- it's just, I'm pretty much hanging (( )), you know.  

A.34:  Oh, that's good.  

B.35:  Christmas music, yeah, around Christmas, sure.  

A.36:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

B.37:  But, uh,  

A.38:  So that's, that's good, I,  

B.39:  It just depends, but I'll probably say rock, you know.  

A.40:  For your favorite, yeah.  

B.41:  Not heavy metal so much anymore, but,  

A.42:  Uh-huh.  

B.43:  I kind of grew out of that.  It's a little irritating now, I guess.

A.44:  Is it?  [Laughter]. 

B.45:  I see why my parents didn't like it -- 

A.46:  No -- 

B.47:  -- when I was in junior high, but,  

A.48:  -- that's about how it goes [laughter].  

B.49:  Oh, yeah.  Can't understand the, what the heck is going on.  

A.50:  Yeah, well, did you, do you listen to your music loud?  Do you like it loud
or,

B.51:  No, just regular.  I'm a kid, probably.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  But,  

A.54:  Uh-huh.  

B.55:  It's, just not, I don't irritate --

A.56:  Yeah.

B.57:  -- anybody with it.  

A.58:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's, I, you know, when I said I liked the country, I, I
don't like the real heavy country like the, you know, crying all [laughter],
but just the, just the light country stuff and I also like, uh, I like a lot
of contemporary music.  I, I like all kinds of music.  I even like classical.
I have that playing, you know, once in a while in the background here at home
and, uh --

B.59:  Right.  

A.60:  -- enjoy that so, do you go to concerts or,  

B.61:  Yeah, as a matter of fact, uh, the other day here, I was, uh, downtown --

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  -- uh, a sale call, working, you know, Van Halen, I don't know, you might
see this in the --

A.64:  Uh-huh.

B.65:  -- news, they put on a free concert -- 

A.66:  Oh. 

B.67:  -- and out on calls, [children] and we just happened to be about a mile
away, so we went down there, to the West End District which is a, real nice,
uh, downtown area --

A.68:  Oh {faint}.

B.69:  -- which is a big hang out for a lot of tourists and stuff, so they put it
on and, uh, it was unannounced type thing --

A.70:  Oh. 

B.71:  -- and they announced it like two hours before the show -- 

A.72:  Oh. 

B.73:  -- and we just happened to be down there and -- 

A.74:  Well, that's nice.  

B.75:  -- it was a little riot almost broke out because it was -- 

A.76:  Oh, really?   

B.77:  -- we happened to be in a restaurant across the street, you know, nice
seats but, 

A.78:  [Laughter]. 

B.79:  Yeah, I used to do the concert thing when I was younger -- 

A.80:  Uh-huh.  

B.81:  -- but, I mean, it's just, now, I mean, you want to lose your hearing, 

A.82:  Yeah.  

B.83:  God, it was just -- 

A.84:  And a lot of money, too.  

B.85:  -- I just to go out with my friends and stuff in high school. 

A.86:  Oh, really?  

B.87:  Oh, yeah, but,   

A.88:  Oh [throat_clearing].  

B.89:  It's not, I don't know, I mean, with the prices and, you know, thirty-five
dollar ticket --

A.90:  Yeah.  

B.91:  -- and there's not really that, anybody I really want to see --

A.92:  No, not for that,  

B.93:  -- for that much, amount of money, now.  

A.94:  That's right.  Do you play a musical instrument?  [Children]. 

B.95:  No, I don't even, I was in a band in junior high, I played baritone, but --

A.96:  Oh. 

B.97:  -- that wasn't,  

A.98:  You haven't, haven't kept that up,  

B.99:  That was more or less, you know, for the heck of it.  

A.100:  Uh-huh.  Oh, well that's good.  I, I played piano a little bit and I,

B.101:  How to be a w-, w-, a well rounded individual, I guess, uh,   

A.102:  [Laughter]  Well, I,  

B.103:  I hadn't even thought about that since like, uh,  

A.104:  Oh, well, if there's, I guess there's still chance [laughter].  But, you do
like to listen to music, you do enjoy it?

B.105:  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  

A.106:  I do, too.  I do, too.  I think it's really, really powerful.  It can make
a lot of, lot of strong statements.

B.107:  Uh-huh.  

A.108:  Trying to, I hope my kids will be interested.  I'd love for them to play in
a marching band.  I like the music from marching bands, you know, in parades.
As they're going by, I, I enjoy the drums and the trumpets and all that kind
of stuff.  So, I guess I like all, most all kinds of music and, 

B.109:  Yeah, my, ex-girlfriend's dad used to be in a, a drum corp or whatever.

A.110:  Oh, did he?  

B.111:  Back in, and they were from up north.  I guess it's real big up there.

A.112:  Oh. 

B.113:  It's in Wisconsin. 

A.114:  Oh. 

B.115:  And that's one thing he, he was always really into that.  I just remember
it,

A.116:  Well, that's interesting.  I've never heard a drum corp in person.  D-,
had, did you hear any of, hear him play at all or, 

B.117:  Uh, I'd seen some, they have these competitions like once a year out here.
I know [children_yelling] it's just drum corps that come out and, I've never
been to one, but, I mean --

A.118:  Oh,  

B.119:  -- I know, it's, I guess, they just have their, uh,
