=======================================================================

A.1:  Well, um, I don't know, I have only been, um, selected for jury duty one
time, and it was sort of a, a rude awakening, 

B.2:  [Laughter].

A.3:  to our judicial system.  Um, after having served on the jury and, uh,
come to a decision, uh, and, and really it was a case that was cut and dry.
The, uh, the defendant on, uh, the witness stand admitted he was guilty, 

B.4:  [Laughter].

A.5:  and then, uh, the first thing was done, was after, uh, we found him
guilty, his attorney jumped up and, uh, started going through the pro-, you
know, routine for filing an appeal, [laughter] which, you know, I, I, I know
that that's the right, uh, but the defendant, but I mean, it makes you wonder
why go through it one more time when, you know, he admitted he was guilty of
the crime.  So --

B.6:  It,

A.7:  -- I don't know, it, it was a little bit disgruntling to me.

B.8:  Right.  I have never served on a jury.  I have been called like only twice
in my life, and, and, uh, at the time I've been a legal assistant and nobody
wanted me on their jury [laughter], 

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  so I've been excused, but, uh, I, uh, I don't know.  I look at the
people who get excused, and, and it's supposed to be a jury of your peers, and
I'm not sure it always is.

A.11:  Right.

B.12:  Uh, and it is a l-, it is a huge burden to put on people who don't know the
law, uh, you know, that, especially in criminal cases.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  When you're deciding someone's life, I, I'm not so sure that, you know,
that that's something that is, that you can really, really have the knowledge
to do --

A.15:  Oh not,

B.16:  -- as, as just a lay person,

A.17:  I agree with that, and certainly, uh, I think that, uh, I know that, uh, I
have heard of people being, you know, on a criminal case, and, uh, saying
that, you know, and I think you've got this option, that if you want, if you
are found guilty by the jury, that you can choose, even before the trial
begins, for the judge to sentence you, uh, and that, I think, I think I'm
correcting, correct in that.  But, uh,

B.18:  Well, a lot of states the judge can se-, I mean, they do set the penalty,
you know, the, the judgment, at, once it's rendered guilty --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- you know, the sentencing is done by the judge in, in a lot of the cases.
Uh, some cases it is up to the jury, but, you know, you're told if you find
them guilty, then this is the choices that they have to make.  It's either
life or death, [laughter] you know.

A.21:  Right, right.

B.22:  But, uh, I do-, I don't know.  It just, it, it seems like in some of these
cases I don't know that you could really have an impartial juror because of
the media given --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- and I don't, you know, in today's age of television, the coverage like
it is, there's no way that you can be shielded from it.

A.25:  Well, I, I understand what you're saying, and at the same time I'm afraid
that there are people out there that walk, are walking around that have no
more conception of what's going on, day in and day out, than you're someone
came down from Mars.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  And, and unfortunately, those people who in my book, I would, I would
consider them to be terribly uninformed, might be deemed the most eligible
people to be put on the jury, while, like you said earlier, I don't
necessarily, I don't think I'd consider them to be a jury of my peers --

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  -- you know, so I, but, that's, well, you know, one of the reasons why I
hope I never have to be in a position to have a jury listen to what, a case of
mine, and I hope I never, you know, #am in that situation.#

B.30:  #Well, I know when I've been,# you know, called to jury duty, they had to
stand up there, or stay, you know, until they dismissed me, and I look at the
people and the reasons that they get dismissed, uh, before they even, you
know, the selection is, is even started.

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  Is, is your profession, you know, nine-tenths of them are your professional
people --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- who are out in the world, you know, the rest are retired or they're
housewives or, uh, you,
