Speaker A.

======================================================================

A.1:   Okay.  Do you have anybody, uh, in your family that you ever
had to put in a nursing home or,   

B.2:   My grandmother, uh, is the only person so far.  

A.3:   Yeah.  

B.4:   And, uh, I basically think for her, you know, it was, it was
the best thing.  She was pretty out of it by the time she went into
the nursing home.  

A.5:   Was that here in Texas?  

B.6:   No, it was in Arizona.  I'm from Phoenix, and so it was in,
uh, it was in Phoenix, Arizona and, uh, that was hard but I, it
wasn't too hard a decision, because there was sort of no other
option -- 

A.7:   Right.  

B.8:   -- by the time we put her in the nursing home.  

A.9:   Did, did you have to put her in yourself, or,  

B.10:   No, I d-, my mother did.  Uh, she lived with, well, my aunt
and my mother.  She lived with my aunt for a long time and then it
got to where she was not manageable anymore.  She was, she didn't
have Alzheimer's, but, uh, she was pretty much out of it -- 

A.11:   I understand, understand.  

B.12:   -- and, you know, so they finally had to do that.  How about
you?  

A.13:   Well, my, uh, aunt that I kind of grew up with, uh, was in a
nursing home.  She did have Alzheimer's and we had to put her in
the nursing home because of that, but, uh --  

B.14:   Uh-huh.  

A.15:   -- this was up in, uh, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and, uh, it was a
situation that's probably as good as you're going to get.  Uh, it's 
associated with, uh, our church -- 

B.16:   Uh-huh.  

A.17:   -- and, uh, what they do, my mother is in, is, a terrace,
which, it's called (( )) terrace and, uh, these are condominiums,
you buy into -- 

B.18:   Right.  

A.19:   -- when, you know, whenever, you know, you're sixty, or
whatever, you know, whenever you want to buy into this thing and
these are very nice condominium things and, uh, the idea is once
you are in this program, you are taken care of the rest of your
life and --   

B.20:   Uh-huh.  

A.21:   -- they, they have a nursing home if you can't maintain your
own apartment or your condominium, uh, you automatically go into
that and from there they also have a health care area if you can't,
you know, if you need more intensive care.  

B.22:   Uh-huh.  

A.23:   And, uh, even the best there is isn't a nice situation with,
uh, like you say, when you get to the point where, uh, well, she
was ninety-four and she was, uh, in the nursing home and the health
care facility for I would guess about a year's time.  But, uh, it's
a hard decision to make.  I tell you, it's, uh, 

B.24:   Well, it is, now was your aunt, she was, she no longer had her
mental faculties?  

A.25:   That's, that was really the p-, and that, it gets very hard
and, on -- 

B.26:   Right.  

A.27:   -- anybody.  Uh, I'd go up there and visit and, and she would
recognize me, but -- 

B.28:   Uh-huh.  

A.29:   -- as soon as I was out down the hall, she didn't even know I
was there.  

B.30:   Uh-huh.  

A.31:   And, uh, it's, it's sad.  You know it, 

B.32:   Well, it is sad.  I think, I don't think for me it would be as
hard a decision if their minds were gone.  I think it's a harder
decision if they're still, if their minds are still good, but
they're completely, their bodies are gone, you know.  

A.33:   Yeah.  

B.34:   I think that would be really hard to put someone in a nursing
home in that situation.  Uh, you know, I think there's some times
when there's just nothing else that can be done.  But, I, uh, my
father's dead, and, and so I just have my mother and she's in real
good health, but, I would hate to have to make that decision for
her.  Uh, you know -- 

A.35:   Well, it's,  

B.36:   -- I hope that, that w-,  

A.37:   But what's really hard is the differences of care.  You 
know --

B.38:   Right.  

A.39:   -- if you aren't fortunate enough to have a situation like
with my mother right now, she's got terrible arthritis in her
knees, and it's probably not real long where she won't be able to,
you know, get along -- 

B.40:   Uh-huh.  

A.41:   -- on her own.  

B.42:   Uh-huh.  

A.43:   And she probably, you know, hopefully it will be a number of
years, but she's seventy-nine years old right now and, now she
understands that someday, you know, if she can't handle her
apartment that, uh, you know, she'll have to go in the nursing
home.  

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   But if you have situations where you don't have that kind, you
know, it's, you're confronted with it and if you look at all the
different nursing homes, uh, that are out there, it, it is kind of
frightening.  Some of these places.  Uh, it's like put them in a
cubbyhole and, you know, they don't, they're, they're more
caretakers kind of, it's almost like putting a dog in a kennel, you
know --  

B.46:   Right.  

A.47:   -- some of these places.  

B.48:   Right.  

A.49:   They stink and they're, it, it's a tough decision.  And, you
know, if people don't have the resources for, uh, it's, I, I don't
know about in Arizona, but around here I understand, it's, it's
anywhere from about twenty-three hundred to three thousand dollars
a month in a, a nursing home.  

B.50:   I'm, I'm sure that's probably true.  I, I don't know anymore. 
Now, my grandmother's was the same idea as what you're telling me. 
Sh-, we, when we put my grandmother in, uh, she was in a room by
her, you know, she had a roommate and, but her, her care wasn't
completely hospital, yet.  

A.51:   Right.  

B.52:   But, uh, and then she went into the hospital part.  So it was
one of those progressive care, uh, kinds of situations and it was
also, affiliated with our church, so, it was a really nice
facility.  But, it would be terrible if you had no funds and, and
had to put someone in a nursing home and not know what kind of care
they were really getting.  

A.53:   Yeah.

B.54:   [Lipsmack]  And, of course, it's hard to know that unless
you're there all the time.  Uh,  

A.55:   Well, and that's the other thing that helps is that you have
a relative, a close relative that will look in on them.  

B.56:   Uh-huh.  

A.57:   Even the best ones, if you don't look in on them, they have a
tendency to just sedate people so they aren't bothered, you know. 

B.58:   Right.
