a dog barking in the background.

==========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, do, do you have a home, or apartment? 

B.2:  Uh-huh, I have a home.  

A.3:  Okay, do you have to do a lot of upkeep? 

B.4:  Not really, we have a small backyard and small front yard -- 

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- but, uh, uh, I do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the
weeding and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy [laughter].

A.7:  [Laughter]. 

B.8:  That's another story.  

A.9:  Okay [laughter].  

B.10:  [Laughter]  And, uh, and, uh, I do the edging and stuff like that, but, uh,
it doesn't take us that long because our, our yard is so small.

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  But, uh, I try and do as much, you know flowering as I can, and --

A.13:  Uh-huh. 

B.14:  -- that kind of stuff.  

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  The seasonal things.  

A.17:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

B.18:  But, uh, [lipsmack] I think we have one of the nicest yards in the, in
the neighborhood [laughter].

A.19:  Well, that's nice [laughter].  I wish I could say that.  

B.20:  [Laughter]. 

A.21:  Ours is pretty small, too, but it, it takes about an hour with the two of
us working --

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  -- to, you know, do the bushes and all of that sort of thing. 

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  Uh, the worst part is controlling the weeds.  

B.26:  Oh, yeah.  

A.27:  Which I hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and,
because, like, we have a dog and, and, you know, he's going to be out in the
yard and who knows who he eats out there.

B.28:  That's true.  

A.29:  But we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.  Uh
[lipsmack], um, what else.  I get to put out all the Christmas lights out
there and all that, 

B.30:  [Laughter]. 

A.31:  sort of thing [laughter].  

B.32:  I don't [laughter].  

A.33:  No?  

B.34:  No, he does that.  

A.35:  Oh, okay.  

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  Well, if they, if they go up like, one year we -- 

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- did the edge of the house -- 

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- all the way up on the roof and I -- 

B.42:  Oh. 

A.43:  -- I went up on the roof once and I'll never do it again [laughter].

B.44:  Oh, God.  

A.45:  I decided I was afraid [laughter].  

B.46:  Yeah.  Don't blame you {very faint}.

A.47:  So this year, he got lazy so I said, fine I'll put some on the bushes.  And
that's about it, that's all --

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  -- it gets.  

B.50:  Huh, okay, we don't have that many bushes to put them on.  Uh, [lipsmack]
our, our yard is very, uh, narrow --

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- and so we have some bushes, but we don't have too many, but we have a
nice tree in the front and --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- uh, we have people that, an association that comes and mows everybody's
front yard --

A.55:  Oh, wow.  

B.56:  -- and, uh, they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower.

A.57:  Oh, no.  

B.58:  You know, every time you do that, it, uh, kind of kills the tree for a
while.

A.59:  Yeah.  

B.60:  And so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it
back going again.

A.61:  Oh. 

B.62:  And we started mowing our own lawn --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- because they were doing that.  And so, anyways I have a nice full tree
now and, and we put (( )), we fill it with lights and --

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  -- that kind of thing.  

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  So,  

A.69:  Um.  

B.70:  And they would, uh, they also edged, when they would edge in, into the
shrubbery [laughter] and --

A.71:  Oh, no [laughter].  

B.72:  -- oh, gosh, it was getting really bad, so we,  

A.73:  But you still have to pay for it, though, even though they're not going to
do it?

B.74:  Yeah, because it's an association fee.  

A.75:  Oh, is it real expensive?  

B.76:  Yes -- 

A.77:  Oh, gosh.  

B.78:  -- it's like seventy a month.  

A.79:  Oh, my goodness.  

B.80:  Yeah, and I don't like, I, I just get really upset every time I make that
check out.

A.81:  Yeah.  

B.82:  But, uh,  

A.83:  Well, do, do they do other things for you all?  

B.84:  They take care of the, uh, landscape, because we live in a cul-de-sac and
there is a island in the middle --

A.85:  Uh-huh.

B.86:  -- so they care of that and there is a pool and they take care of the 
pool --

A.87:  Uh-huh.

B.88:  -- and, and there is a pond, they take care of the pond in the park area
and that kind of thing.

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  And, uh, so you're basically paying, oh, and the sprinkler system that,
that our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does and, uh --

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  -- certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems and --

A.93:  Uh-huh.

B.94:  -- and so that way if someone moves out, the entire neighborhood is mowed
and watered and that kind of thing, you know.

A.95:  Um.  

B.96:  So,  

A.97:  But you knew when you moved in, you'd have to pay that, didn't you?

B.98:  Well, it, it, it went up what we pay.  

A.99:  Oh [laughter].  

B.100:  And that's the bad thing.  I just hope it doesn't go up any more because --

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  -- we just can't afford it anymore.  I don't know what to do if you can't
afford it [laughter].

A.103:  I don't know either.  That's interesting.  

B.104:  So, uh, but, they're, that's what they do.  They take care of basically the
front yards and --

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  -- unless you don't want them to do it. 

A.107:  Now do at a do things like plant bushes and trees?  

B.108:  They, o-, only in, like, in the common areas and in the island.

A.109:  Oh, okay. 

B.110:  But they don't do it in your yard.  

A.111:  So, there is, like, no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or
anything like that?

B.112:  Right, uh-huh, yeah, so we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.

A.113:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they
had.  I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.

B.114:  I know.  

A.115:  And put new ones out front.  But that was a lot of work.  

B.116:  Yeah.  

A.117:  Took me a long time.  

B.118:  Yeah, [barking] that's what we did when we first moved in, too.

A.119:  Uh-huh.  

B.120:  Just rearranged some things [laughter].  

A.121:  Yeah, and then, then we put in a sprinkler system, and,   

B.122:  Oh. 

A.123:  We won't go through that again, I will pay someone [barking] to do it
[laughter].

B.124:  Oh, really?  

A.125:  Oh, it took so long.  

B.126:  Oh. 

A.127:  Because [barking] my husband was, you know, digging the trenches [barking]
because he didn't want to get a trencher, you know, there is a machine that
will --

B.128:  Oh, yeah.  

A.129:  -- do it.  Because, you know, there is so many people that broke either
their water main or their gas main doing it.  And [barking] --

B.130:  Oh.

A.131:  -- I guess that costs you an absolute fortune.  

B.132:  That's true, so gosh, you did it manually.  

A.133:  By hand.  

B.134:  Oh. 

A.135:  [Laughter]. 

B.136:  Oh, gosh.  

A.137:  Yeah, but it works great now that we've got it.  

B.138:  I bet.  

A.139:  Yeah, it's nice.  

B.140:  Yeah, that's a good investment there.  

A.141:  Yeah, well, we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble, you
know, you have to keep the, the area moist --

B.142:  Oh. 

A.143:  -- around the house or it makes it worse, so, we had an incentive there --

B.144:  Oh. 

A.145:  -- to do that.
