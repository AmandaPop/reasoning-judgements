=========================================================================

A.1:  Oh, [breathing] I've done more painting than I want to talk about my, uh,
in my time.  I had a, uh, [lipsmack] uh, three bedroom, two and a half bath,
two story town house in Atlanta about ten years ago that I started.  I was
just going to touch up paint in a couple of rooms.  Before it was over, I
wound up painting the entire thing because the more I did it, the worse it
made everything else look.

B.2:  The rest look [laughter].  

A.3:  So anyway, but that included ceilings, walls, woodwork and everything.
And, and, you know, I found out, number one, I can do it, you know, and I was,
I was really pleased with the results after it was finally finished.  But,
gosh, it was a lot of work.

B.4:  Yeah, but you feel good about it when you have done it yourself.

A.5:  Yeah, you really do.  

B.6:  And you do save a lot of money.  

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  But, it's a mess and it's hard to find the time.  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  It is, and, well, I was fortunate at the time.  I had a job that,
uh, I, uh, it was r-, strictly an eight hour job and, uh --

B.10:  Uh-huh.  

A.11:  -- so I, but that really cut my social life out for, gosh, I don't know,
about a month and a half, seemed like all I did, I mean every spare minute, I
had a paint brush in my hand.

B.12:  [Laughter]. 

A.13:  Or a roller.  But, like you say, it, it made a difference and it really
increased the value of my property --

B.14:  Oh, yeah.  

A.15:  -- when I sold it, I'm sure.  

B.16:  Oh, yeah, it does.  Yeah, I've painted inside, I haven't painted outside
and that's what I need done now.

A.17:  Well my brother and sister-in-law in Austin, uh, are just finishing
painting the entire outside of their house.  Their house is almost all wood.

B.18:  Um.  

A.19:  And what a lot of work that was -- 

B.20:  Yeah.  

A.21:  -- and they had to scrape it and,

B.22:  That's the work.  

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  Yeah.  

A.25:  And the putty and caulk and paint.  I was up there about a month ago and
what they had done looked marvelous, but I mean the work was tremendous.

B.26:  Yeah, I don't think I'll attempt that myself.  I, I know I won't
[laughter].

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Yeah, I'll hire somebody to do that, but, in fact, I had a workman here for
a leak that he had to fix and for ten dollars he was willing to paint my
daughter's ceiling, so I said, go ahead, you paint the ceiling and then I'll
do the walls and that was, that was nice.

A.29:  Listen, you got a great bargain.  For ten,  

B.30:  Yeah, for ten dollars [laughter].  

A.31:  For ten dollars.  I'd let,

B.32:  He was saying he was chatting and we were having a good old time --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- so he just said, all right, ten dollars, I'll do the ceiling [laughter].

A.35:  That's incredible.  I, painting the ceilings is absolutely the worst thing.

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  And, and especially -- 

B.38:  It is.  

A.39:  -- especially so, so much ceilings have this, you know, this horrible
texture that's just like, you know --

B.40:  Right.  

A.41:  -- like popcorn b-, uh,

B.42:  Well, hers didn't, it was just a smooth ceiling -- 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- but,

A.45:  But, but the place that I had in Atlanta that I wound up painting the
ceilings everywhere, it had a pretty, pretty much a lot of texture on and it
just was a nightmare to paint --

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  -- and I just, you know, I just, I, I got, now, I accumulated a lot of drop
cloths and I had my painting gear that, you know, the same clothes, I'd just
throw them in the washer and, you know, wear them again and pretty soon they
were just, you know, tie dyed with paint.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  But, you know, painting the ceiling if it's not smooth, can really be a
nightmare.

B.50:  Oh, yeah, I have that in my living room and dining room, but we had a leak
and the insurance company's going to pay to do the whole area.

A.51:  Wow, that's good.  

B.52:  So that's going to be a good deal.  I won't have to worry about that.

A.53:  Yeah.  What was so funny with my, my brother and sister-in-law in, in
Austin when they started, uh, talking about, you know, they knew they needed
to paint their house and they got some estimates and they were just, you know,
exorbitant.  So [breathing] they started going around and, and looking at
paint colors and they must have looked at five hundred different paint chips
and then they finally settled on white.

B.54:  White, oh, no [laughter].  

A.55:  [Laughter]. 

B.56:  Oh, no.  

A.57:  Well then, you know, there, again, I, you can't go wrong with your good
basic white.

B.58:  Yeah, I guess.  I, I think I'll go with an off white.  

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  I'm changing everything so,

A.61:  Well, that was the other thing, too, after I painted [throat_clearing],
then I had to go in and, uh, change the window treatments, because I, you
know, got rid of some old, uh, uh, wallpaper --

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  -- and, you know, so it went, you know, not only the paint, but I wound up
doing quite a few things, so, uh --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- and changed out some lighting and, and so forth and so on, put some
dimmers in.

B.66:  Yeah, it's all challenging, that's for sure.  I've, the whole year it's
taking me to redecorate my bedroom and my daughter's bedroom.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  But it's pretty, I love it.  I've upholstered walls and made curtains 
and,

A.69:  Who did, did you do the wall?  

B.70:  I did.  Yes.  

A.71:  Did you really?  

B.72:  Uh-huh.  

A.73:  I'm impressed.  

B.74:  And it looks so nice because you just take sheets and then everything can
match.

A.75:  Huh.  

B.76:  And it looks really pretty.  I love it.  It's just real feminine and just
real pretty.

A.77:  Yeah, I like wall upholstery, but now that's something I would never even
dream of,

B.78:  Oh, it's easy.  Oh, if you can do all that, you can do walls. 

A.79:  Really?  

B.80:  Oh, there's nothing to it.  

A.81:  Huh.  

B.82:  You can do a wall in half an hour.  

A.83:  You're kidding.  

B.84:  Uh-uh.  Staple gun is all it takes.  

A.85:  Oh, okay.  Did you put anything behind the sheet?  

B.86:  I did, I put the batting.  

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  Uh-huh.  

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  And just, staple it up there and staple your sheets up and then,

A.91:  And that's all it is to it.  

B.92:  Yeah, and then you can glue a little edge around if you want to, like I
took some eyelet lace --

A.93:  Yeah.  

B.94:  -- and I just hot glued it around the edge.  

A.95:  Well [laughter],   

B.96:  But it's nothing, and it's just beautiful, I love it.  

A.97:  Well, I'll be.  Well, I'll have to keep that in mind.  I, I just,
