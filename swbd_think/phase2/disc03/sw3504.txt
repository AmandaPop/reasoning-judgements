=======================================================================

A.1:  Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers.  

B.2:  Is it?  I'd have to agree with that.  They are my favorite team, too.

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  A little disappointing the last few years.  

A.5:  I'm telling you.  You think they'll sign Ruben?  

B.6:  You know -- 

A.7:  No?  

B.8:  -- I really don't.  I just don't think, you know, with that guy from
Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or [laughter] twenty-nine
million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able
to sign Ruben Sierra and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our
area.

A.9:  Right.  Yeah, I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the
other, uh, Hispanic players.

B.10:  Oh, I do, too.  I just,  

A.11:  I think -- 

B.12:  The main thing,  

A.13:  -- that's going to be the big problem.  

B.14:  It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know.  

A.15:  Right.  

B.16:  We just can't seem to, you know, I think we've been in this spot, I think
we finished second once or maybe even twice.  I don't know, I --

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  -- I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years.  It's just,
it's just too disappointing.  I just watch them fall every year.

A.19:  Right.  

B.20:  I was a Pete Incaviglia fan and, uh -- 

A.21:  [Laughter]  Oh. 

B.22:  -- I liked him, but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all
just, decisions like that have to be made by someone [laughter].  Glad it's
not me making them.

A.23:  Right I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million
fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get
a contender in here.  But,

B.24:  They say as long as they draw up two million fans that -- 

A.25:  Right.  

B.26:  -- Greave and Valentine will be there.  

A.27:  Right, yeah.  

B.28:  So, and that's the name of the game, too.  You got to make money.

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  You know, pay these players so much money, now, it's just -- 

A.31:  Right.  

B.32:  -- it's frightening.  You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out
and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat
[laughter] or something like that.

A.33:  [Laughter] That's true.  But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if
they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign
the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what
they, what else they need.  Because they've got the hitting, but they need the
pitching.

B.34:  Yeah, they really do.  

A.35:  Um.  

B.36:  I think they, uh, I think they need them all.  I just don't under-, I
understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big
cities and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon
and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at
a --

A.37:  Oh, I know.  

B.38:  -- at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store, but, I
realize the difference, but, I just don't understand,

A.39:  Yeah, it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you
know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not
bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.

B.40:  Oh, I know.  

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  I tell you.  

A.43:  It's real aggravating, but,  

B.44:  But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by
George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them because
I tell you, we need a winner in this town.  It looks like our Cowboys are
coming back but,

A.45:  That's right.  

B.46:  So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas, but, you know, in the
past half a [laughter] dozen years, all we've had is the, uh --

A.47:  It's always got,  

B.48:  -- the soccer team.   

A.49:  Yeah, it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though
this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area, but you think we'd,
someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, [noise] the, the
players we need.

B.50:  Oh, I know.  It's,  

A.51:  Just real aggravating to [breathing] because I've lived here, you know,
since, well, I was born and raised here, so I've been a Ranger fan since about
seventy-seven, so it's a lot of losers [laughter].

B.52:  Oh, I know.  

A.53:  It's about to get, you know -- 

B.54:  I've been one,  

A.55:  -- as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know.  

B.56:  Yeah, I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four and I've really been a
Ranger fan for the longest time and [throat_clearing] excuse me, I don't miss
a time picking up the morning paper --

A.57:  Right.  

B.58:  -- and checking the box score.  I mean I follow them and I follow them like
I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys, but, and I want to see
them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it.  I mean, it,

A.59:  Right.  

B.60:  You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that
stadium.

A.61:  I'm telling you.  

B.62:  I love Nolan Ryan.  I guess you probably love him, too.  

A.63:  Right, I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff
team.

B.64:  Oh, I -- 

A.65:  T-, I mean,  

B.66:  -- do, too.  

A.67:  It would be packed.  And they got that new stadium they are building.  So,
at least, at least that will be exciting [laughter] --

B.68:  It will.  

A.69:  -- when we get that, but,  

B.70:  Well, where do you think they are heading this year?  

A.71:  Uh, [breathing] it's hard to say.  It's going to be depending on where the,
what they do with Ruben Sierra and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them
going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin
Brown --

B.72:  Right [laughter].  

A.73:  -- is the answer, and, man, that's getting old, you know.  These guys have
been pampered.  I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up.

B.74:  Yeah, Bobby Witt -- 

A.75:  And,  

B.76:  -- gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever and they have the
later ten game winning streak --

A.77:  Right.  

B.78:  -- and they give him all kinds of money and then he just goes right down
the tubes.

A.79:  And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to
get old.  But I like this Sandy Johnson.
