B.1:   Hello?  

A.2:   Hello?  

B.3:   Hi [laughter].  Yes?  

A.4:   How are you?  

B.5:   Hi, I'm fine.  

A.6:   {Pause} Did you, uh, did you get the topic?  

B.7:   I think they said hobbies, didn't they?  

A.8:   Yes.  

B.9:   Yeah.  

A.10:   Uh-huh, where are you calling from?  

B.11:   Plano.  

A.12:   Oh, okay, I'm in Dallas.  

B.13:   Are you?  

A.14:   Yeah [laughter].  

B.15:   That's about as far away as I've gotten so far [laughter].  

A.16:   Oh, really?  

B.17:   I had a lady two blocks away last time [laughter].  

A.18:   Oh, I talked to a guy in Virginia Beach last night.  

B.19:   Oh, see that would be fun.  

A.20:   Yeah.  

B.21:   [Laughter].  

A.22:   That was interesting.  

B.23:  Yeah.  

A.24:   Okay, let's talk about our hobbies.  You ready?  

@B.25:   Okay.  

A.26:   Okay [beep].  Uh, I don't have too many hobbies right now.  I
do sew a lot.  

B.27:   Uh-huh.  

A.28:   And, uh, I used to sew more than what I do now.  It's, it's
takes a lot of patience and I'm running out of that -- 

B.29:   Yeah -- 

A.30:   -- the older I get.  

B.31:   -- it does [laughter]. 

A.32:   And I used to do a lot of stitchery and, uh, but that takes a
long time, too.  It's just, it's very time consuming to do sewing
and stitchery and things like that.  What do you do?  

B.33:   Well, I used to sew a lot when my girls were really little and
I made a lot of their things.  But, like yourself, I find I run out
of patience [laughter] with it, too.  

A.34:   [Laughter]. 

B.35:   And I like to do craft things.  

A.36:   Uh-huh.  

B.37:   You know, I was, uh, make those fabric covered photo albums
and I teach a class.  

A.38:   Oh, those are nice.  

B.39:   Uh-huh.  

A.40:   Those are really pretty.  

B.41:   And I teach that at the Parks and Rec Department a couple
times a year.  

A.42:   Teach what?  

B.43:   How to do it.  

A.44:   Oh, I see.  

B.45:   Uh-huh.  And I do that, and I do a lot of interior decorating
and I can upholster the walls and things like that.  

A.46:   Uh-huh.  

B.47:   So that's about my hobby and I don't have time for a whole
lot.  

A.48:   That's right.  

B.49:   But, uh, it used to be you did those things to relax you, but
now I don't think there is time to relax [laughter] so,  

A.50:   [Laughter]. 

B.51:   so there is not very much time for that, but, uh,  

A.52:   That's right, because the women work now.  

B.53:   Uh-huh.  

A.54:   Most, most of them do.  

B.55:   I do, uh-huh.  

A.56:   I did things like that when I wasn't working.  

B.57:   Right.  

A.58:   When, uh, my kids were little babies -- 

B.59:   Yes, see, I did, too.  

A.60:   -- and I stayed home with them, that's when I did it.  

B.61:   Right.  

A.62:   But, when you work full time, then it's very hard.  

B.63:   Yeah, it is hard, but it does save money to do things that way
and, uh, I found that I got pretty good at decorating, so, that
kind of is real helpful, but you do have to find the time.  

A.64:   Uh-huh.  

B.65:   So,  

A.66:   Well, you probably did it more when your girls were little. 
You did it -- 

B.67:   Not really.  

A.68:   -- with them.  

B.69:   I just really started to do that.  I just redecorated my
bedroom this past year and then I went on to my daughter's room. 
They turned out really nice.  

A.70:   Wow.  

B.71:   I just bought sheets and I made the curtains and I upholstered
the walls and in her room, I even upholstered her furniture, the
drawers.  

A.72:   Oh, that's nice.  

B.73:   And it really turned out nice.  

A.74:   Uh-huh.  

B.75:   So, you can do a lot for a pretty little amount of money that
way.  

A.76:   That's true.  

B.77:   So my latest thing is those stiffy bow baskets.  

A.78:   Those what?  

B.79:   The baskets with the stiffy bows.  Have you seen those?  

A.80:   I don't know if I have or not.  

B.81:   Uh, they're, they just have, uh, like pieces of fabric and
they put it in, uh, fabric stiffener, and let it dry and then bend
it, and put it on baskets.  It's really attractive -- 

A.82:   Oh. 

B.83:   -- and I, I haven't done one, but I bought the things I need
and, uh, my daughter's mom,   

A.84:   Is that for a table center piece?  

B.85:   Uh,  

A.86:   The basket.  

B.87:   It's just to sit around the house, like for sewing and
magazines and -- 

A.88:   Oh, I see.  

B.89:   -- whatever you want.  

A.90:   To put things in.  Uh-huh.  

B.91:   Potpourri.  Depends on the size you buy.  

A.92:   Uh-huh.  

B.93:   And, uh, friend of mine does them and they're just really
pretty and she's supposed to show me exactly how to do it one day
when I show her how to do an album, so, I don't know what day that
will be [laughter] but that's our next project.  

A.94:   [Laughter]. 

B.95:   Probably after Christmas [laughter].  

A.96:   Well, when my parents had their fiftieth wedding anniversary,
I was working in a little Cloth World shop.  

B.97:   Uh-huh.  

A.98:   And some old ladies came in and they said they did that.  They
said they covered, uh, photo albums like that.  

B.99:   Uh-huh.  

A.100:   And I said, well, uh, why don't you make one for me and put
gold on it because my -- 

B.101:   Right.  

A.102:   -- parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary is coming up.  And
they said okay.  They said how pretty it w-, the ones were that
they made.  So they brought one in for me and, uh, I just, I hated
it.  

B.103:   Uh-oh.  

A.104:   I thought it was awful.  And here I had told them to make it. 
They were from out in the country -- 

B.105:   Um.  

A.106:   -- you know, and they'd made an -- 

B.107:   Got -- 

A.108:   -- extra trip to town --  

B.109:   -- to be careful, yeah [laughter].  

A.110:   -- to bring me my photo album and I, I, I didn't like it at
all.  And I told them, I said, you know, I just don't care for
this.  I don't like the way this is put together.  And, uh, I don't
like what you used and then, and then I felt real bad and I said,
well, I'll take it because I ordered it, you know, and I, it was my
fault, because I didn't specify what I wanted on it or anything. 
I just kind of left it up to them.  

B.111:   Yeah.  

A.112:   And it, it was, they were old ladies,
