=======================================================================

A.1:   This is the first I have used this.  Have you talked to anyone
before?  

B.2:   Only one time before [laughter]. 

A.3:   Okay [laughter].  Uh, I understand that we're supposed to talk
about pets.  

B.4:   That's right.  

A.5:   So do you have any pets?  

@B.6:   I sure do.  I was just feeding them all [laughter].  

A.7:   Oh, what do you have?  

B.8:   I have a, a large aquarium and,  

A.9:   That sounds fishy.  

B.10:   Excuse me?  

A.11:   That sounds fishy.  

B.12:   [Laughter] Yeah, it is [laughter].  

A.13:   I don't guess you make any waves, though, do you.  

B.14:   No [laughter].  

A.15:   [Laughter]. 

B.16:   I've got, I've got a lot of fish in my aquarium and I've also
got a dog who is sitting out there in the rain wishing I'd let him
in [laughter].  

A.17:   Rain?  

B.18:   But I, yeah, it's raining here.  

A.19:   Where, what part of town are you in?  

B.20:   Uh, real far north, just north of Addison.  

A.21:   Oh, really?  

B.22:   Yeah.  

A.23:   Well I'm out in Garland so -- 

B.24:   Oh. 

A.25:    -- it's not ra-, uh, well, it may be raining.  I haven't been
outside.  

B.26:   Yeah, it's raining out here.  

A.27:   Oh. 

B.28:   And I just steam cleaned my carpets today and I really don't
want to let the dog in [laughter].  

A.29:   Bless his heart.  What kind is it?  

B.30:   He is a, a mutt.  He's part Shipperkes and part Chow.  

A.31:   Uh-huh.   

B.32:   And he's, he's real cute.  

A.33:   Is,  

B.34:   He's a, he can turn me into a real sucker sometimes.

A.35:   Can he get in out of the rain?  

B.36:   Uh, yeah, he has a house.  

A.37:   Oh, he just wants to give you the guilt trip.  

B.38:   Well, he usually spends all his time with us [laughter].  

A.39:   I see.  

B.40:   The whole time [laughter].  

A.41:   Well, that's good.  That's good. 

B.42:   How about yourself, do you have any?

A.43:   Well, I used to have a poodle -- 

B.44:   Uh-huh.  

A.45:   -- and he died and so my neighbor's cat has adopted me so,  

B.46:   [Laughter]. 

A.47:   it comes in as, to see me and I -- 

B.48:   Uh-huh.  

A.49:   -- have it a bed made on the little patio outside and -- 

B.50:   Uh-huh.  

A.51:   -- uh, I think it has adopted me, so I think it is my cat 
now,  

B.52:   [Laughter]. 

A.53:   because I even took it and had its shots but because it's
so friendly -- 

B.54:   Oh, you're kidding, huh.  

A.55:   -- I was afraid she had, well, I asked her, she had not had
it's shots -- 

B.56:   Ooh.  

A.57:   -- so I was concerned so I took -- 

B.58:   Yeah.  

A.59:   -- it and had the shots.  

B.60:   That's not good.  

A.61:   No.  It's a beautiful gray cat.  

B.62:   Uh-huh.  

A.63:   It's real sweet.  

B.64:   Oh. 

A.65:   But, anyway, I'm, I have to travel a lot right now.  In about,
um, another year, I'll probably get another dog -- 

B.66:   Uh-huh.  

A.67:   -- because I'll be through traveling.  

B.68:   So, you're a dog person, huh?  

A.69:   Well, I think so.  I don't know how to handle cats.  

B.70:   Really?  I, I used to have a cat and he actu-, he died this
summer.  But, uh, I had him for thirteen years -- 

A.71:   Uh-huh.  

B.72:   -- and when we got this dog, I didn't know what to do
[laughter].  

A.73:   Uh-huh.

B.74:   It just, I never had a dog before in my whole life.  

A.75:   Yeah.  

B.76:   And it was, it's really different to have a different type of
animal.  

A.77:   Well, I, I just don't know much about cats and I, uh, [noise]
I don't know why I don't, they see to themselves, I think more than
dogs do.  

B.78:   Yes, they do.  They're very self sufficient.  And they don't
demand nearly as much attention or care.  

A.79:   That's right.  They say you, you, uh, have a dog, but you,
what is the saying that you never really own a cat, that you,  

B.80:   [Laughter]. 

A.81:   may own a dog, but you, the cats just kind of tolerate,
tolerate you.  

B.82:   Yes, that's right.  That's right.  

A.83:   Well, do you, uh, uh, have your, are you going to breed your
dog?  

B.84:   No, huh-uh.  

A.85:   Oh. 

B.86:   He's been neutered.  

A.87:   Just for fun, huh.  

B.88:   Uh, yeah, he's just a pet and he, he actually turned out to be
a great watchdog, too.  

A.89:   Uh-huh. 

B.90:   So,  

A.91:   Have you been to North Park to see the kennel they have over
there this year that you -- 

B.92:   No.  

A.93:   -- can adopt a dog, you know -- 

B.94:   Uh,  

A.95:   -- for the holidays.  

B.96:   No, I haven't.  

A.97:   That's real cute.  

B.98:   Well, I certainly don't need another one [laughter].  

A.99:   Well, don't go over there, then, because it really hurt,
touches you when you see -- 

B.100:   I know.  

A.101:   -- those that are up for adoption.  

B.102:   Well, you know, I went before we got this dog, we were looking
around and we went to, uh, some humane societies -- 

A.103:   Uh-huh.  

B.104:   -- and that sort of thing.  

A.105:   Uh-huh.  

B.106:   And they would not allow us to adopt a dog.  

A.107:   How come?  

B.108:   Because we both work.  

A.109:   Oh. 

B.110:   And they required someone to be [laughter] home all the time. 
And quite honestly, I think probably some dogs got put to sleep
that could have had a good home.  I mean,  

A.111:   Well, I didn't realize that because I -- 

B.112:   Yeah.  

A.113:   -- most people do work now and -- 

B.114:   That's right.  

A.115:   -- uh, that's surprising.  

B.116:   Yes, and I was too, and, and also there, you know, they come
out and inspect your property and make sure you have a fence, it
has to be like an eight foot fence and our fence only happens to be
six feet.  I mean,  

A.117:   But your little dog can't go over -- 

B.118:   No.  

A.119:   -- an eight foot fence.  

B.120:   No [laughter].  That's a,  

A.121:   So, did you have to end up buying him?  

B.122:   Yeah, we end, we ended up, we got him, it was sort of a flea
market that they had, a pet store had a little shop setup.  

A.123:   Uh-huh.  

B.124:   And, yeah, we ended up buying a dog, which isn't, you know --

A.125:   Yeah.

B.126:   -- really what I wanted to do, but I couldn't pass the
requirements.

A.127:   Isn't that,  

B.128:   And I,  

A.129:   I didn't realize that.  

B.130:   Yeah [laughter].  And I'll tell you [laughter] -- 

A.131:   Well, did you go to,  

B.132:   -- my dog is spoiled [laughter].  

A.133:   Well, somebody told me that the Richardson kennel was good, or
the Richardson -- 

B.134:   Huh.  

A.135:   -- what do you call it, where they, pound, I guess -- 

B.136:   Uh-huh.  

A.137:   -- is real good about letting you have them there so I,    

B.138:   Yeah.  I guess we should have tried the pound, but the humane
society, uh, wasn't interested in giving us a pet so,   

A.139:   Huh, well, that's terrible.  

B.140:   Yeah, I thought it was, too.  

@@A.141:  I don't know how long we're supposed to talk.  Do you?  

B.142:   Uh, it's usually like five minutes.  

A.143:   Okay.  

B.144:   Not too long.  

A.145:   Well, does it, does the recording come on or something?  

B.146:   No, you just sort of decide when you're done -- 

A.147:   Oh, okay.  

B.148:   -- talking and that's it [laughter].  

A.149:   Do you work in Dallas?  

B.150:   Yeah, I work at T I.  

A.151:   Oh, T I, I see.  

B.152:   Yeah.  

A.153:   Oh, so you're part of the program, then.  

B.154:   Well, I just found out about it through a different
department.  

A.155:   Uh-huh.  

B.156:   Uh, I don't know anyone, actually.  Well, I, I might,
