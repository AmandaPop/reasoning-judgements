==========================================================================

A.1:  Well, this is a real easy topic for me to spend at least [breathing] thirty
minutes or an hour on.  I, 

B.2:  [Laughter]. 

A.3:  vaca-,   

B.4:  I don't think they'll let us talk that long.  

@A.5:  Yeah, I know it, I know it.  You say vacation, I just say where.  I love
to go.  I've, and I've been lucky enough.  I've traveled quite a bit, Canada,
Mexico.

B.6:  Oh, my.  

A.7:  Been to Rio, uh, Europe.  

B.8:  Ooh, you've been to Europe?  

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  That's wonderful.  

A.11:  Yeah, I was,

B.12:  I'm envious.  

A.13:  I was lucky enough, uh, when I was, uh, twenty years old, back when the,
the dollar was really strong, I mean it was, you know, still the keen
currency.  I convinced my parents to let me take off a month and go
backpacking in Europe.

B.14:  Uh.  

A.15:  And, uh,

B.16:  That's memories you'll never ever have again probably.  

A.17:  It, not, never.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  And, uh, you know, and I've, just, I went everywhere.  And it's, you know,
the thing,

B.20:  What was your favorite country?  

A.21:  Uh, well, jeez, if I had to pick one country, I guess I would have to say
Italy.

B.22:  Italy, huh?  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  I, I think so, because, uh, it was just the, the history was just
so staggering.  Whenever, you know, you walked into the coliseum and, uh, you
realized how many thousands of years old it was, you know, and you could just
imagine the, uh, the gladiators and the lions and, it was, you know, pretty,
pretty staggering to think of.  And then, of course, then the Roman forum
that's even older than that that's just ruins and, uh, but the food was good,
the people were nice and there was just so much to see and do.

B.24:  Well, that was probably before we were the ugly Americans, too.

A.25:  Well, actually back then, like I said, it was, this is in nineteen
seventy-two and, uh, [throat_clearing] uh, you know, I did the whole trip, uh,
airfare, uh, everything for less than a thousand dollars.

B.26:  Oh [laughter].  

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Not even sure you could get airfare.  

A.29:  Right, and I, and I stayed gone a month.  

B.30:  Golly!  

A.31:  Yeah.  Now, of course, that was back when, uh, auth-, for, or this, uh, the
writer, Arthur, Arthur Frommer had a book out, it was called Europe on five
dollars a day.

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  And so we budgeted and we said, well, we'll be extravagant.  We budgeted
ten dollars a day.

B.34:  [Laughter]. 

A.35:  And,

B.36:  I love it.  

A.37:  And, we s-, kept in that budget and had -- 

B.38:  Wow.  

A.39:  -- just really perfect,

B.40:  Who did you go with?  

A.41:  I went with a friend of mine, uh, that I'd been in high school with.
Actually, he and I, we were in college at the time and we were talking about
going to Colorado, taking a little [noise] trip, uh, to [noise] Colorado that
summer after school got out.  And we started adding up, you know, totaling how
much it was going to cost and I said, hell, we could go to Europe for that.
He said, well, why don't we?

B.42:  Why don't we?  

A.43:  And I said, you know, we did.  I'm, I'm really happy that [noise] --

B.44:  Wow.  

A.45:  -- that we did do that [noise].  

B.46:  I've always wanted to go like to England.  

A.47:  Well, and I've, I've, I've been to England several times since then.  Uh,
and that is, I could go back anytime.

B.48:  Um.  

A.49:  Anytime.  

B.50:  Well, I teach literature and, at the high school level.  

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  And, consequently, I teach all about these wonderful places [laughter] in
Europe and in England especially and Canterbury Cathedral and --

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  -- you know, all of these places [laughter].  

A.55:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.56:  And never seen them.  

A.57:  Well,

B.58:  Somehow that doesn't seem fair.  

A.59:  Well, I, uh, uh, had a job for several years that I traveled just an awful
lot and, uh, as a matter of fact, I stayed gone more than I stayed at home.

B.60:  Um.  

A.61:  Yeah, for about four years and I built up an awful lot of mileage so I've
made three trips to London just using airfare, you know --

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  -- airline mileage and so that's how I've been able to make those trips.

B.64:  Of all of places you visited then, what is your one spot for a vacation
that you would love to go back to?

A.65:  I, I would go back to, uh, if I could go back, 

B.66:  [Sniffing].

A.67:  anywhere, right now, I think I would go back to Edinburgh.

B.68:  Um, why is that?  

A.69:  Well, because, uh, we, I didn't go any farther north in Scotland than
Edinburgh.
	
B.70:  Uh-huh.  

A.71:  And, uh, my brother was over there a couple of years ago and he, uh, uh,
went to, on a driving tour all up through the Scottish highlands and just came
back just raving about how wonderful it was.  Very, very scenic, very
beautiful and it's [noise], it's a part of the [noise], uh, country that's a
little bit off the beaten path.

B.72:  Right.  

A.73:  There are not as many tourists that go out there and I enjoyed, uh,
Scotland so much.  But, I could go back, listen, I could go back into London
any day of the week.  And the beautiful thing about that is, you could take a
train out of London and head any direction, it doesn't make any difference and
take these fabulous day trips and anywhere you go is interesting.  And, uh,
the last time we went, we found this really, uh, small, kind of quaint hotel,
actually, we found it over there on the trip before, but stayed in it the last
time that was reasonable and, uh, just used that as a base and then took day
trips on the train.  The train system is wonderful, which makes me wonder when
we'll ever get our act together here in the U S and have a --

B.74:  Isn't that the truth?  

A.75:  -- and have a decent, uh, transportation system.  But we'd just take day
trips.  And that was, that was a nice way to do it.

B.76:  Did you go to Germany?  

A.77:  [Lipsmack] I have been, yeah, we went, the first time I went over there I
went to Germany and went to Munich and stayed right across the street from one
of the original medieval beer halls.

B.78:  Oh, my goodness.
