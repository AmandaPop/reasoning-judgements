B.1:  Okay.  

A.2:  Um, they said to discuss the type of novels I read for enjoyment.  I like
mysteries.

@B.3:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.4:  #I,# I, I really enjoy a good mystery.  I, I'm not into the gory, bloody
type murder things but [laughter] I like a mystery to curl up with at night.
And, um, do you enjoy mysteries?

B.5:  Well, I do.  I don't read much of them.  I, I, I tend to watch movie
mysteries more than,

A.6:  #Oh, uh-huh.# 

B.7:  #read mysteries.# I read other types of books but who's your favorite
author in terms of mysteries?

A.8:  Well, I enjoy Victoria Holt. 

B.9:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.10:  #I like,# you know, that, that era and that type of a, 

B.11:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.12:  #a setting# so I, I that, the, the type of area that I read.  Um, what kind
of books do you enjoy?

B.13:  Well, [laughter] my, my books are a little bit more, um, [laughter]
different than that.  Um, I tend to, um, right now I, I do a lot of, um,
reading of the, um, Catholic, I do a lot of Catholic saints.

A.14:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.15:  Uh, I do a lot of mystic, um, the, the ancient, um, [lipsmack] writings and
I've,

A.16:  #Oh.# 

B.17:  #been# doing a lot of that kind of reading.  

A.18:  Oh.  

B.19:  And, um, [lipsmack] so like Saint Francis of (( )) and Teresa (( )), um,
Teresa, Saint John of the cross.

A.20:  Uh-huh, #uh-huh.  Oh, that's (( )),#

B.21:  #Um, those kinds of,# of writings, uh, sort of, um, old spiritual leaders.

A.22:  Oh, that's great.

B.23:  Um, it's been real fascinating and -- 

A.24:  Boy, it sounds fascinating.  

B.25:  -- that, that's been a lot of my reading for the past number of years.  And
then I read contemporary people, um, who, um, combine religion and psychology.

A.26:  Uh-huh.  

B.27:  And that's been an interest of mine and so right now, 

A.28:  #Oh.# 

B.29:  #I'm# currently reading a man named Morton ((Kelsey)) --

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  -- and, uh, his, his a book on it called TRANSCEND.  

A.32:  Oh.  

B.33:  And it's a stor-, it's about prayer, 

A.34:  #Oh.# 

B.35:  #and, um,# and it sort of combines, uh, some of the old, uh, with the new.

A.36:  Uh-huh.  

B.37:  So, uh, #I,# 

A.38:  #Well,# that's fascinating.  

B.39:  Yeah, I do that kind of reading although I did do some, uh, casual reading.
My reading lately has been fairly heavy but, um,

A.40:  That sounds heavy.  

B.41:  [Laughter] Yes.

A.42:  [Laughter] In fact it,

B.43:  But I just read, I've read PRINCE OF TIDES, #have you, you know, that's
going to be a new movie and,#

A.44:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh, yes.# 

B.45:  that's a good book if you,

A.46:  #Is it?# 

B.47:  #Yeah,# very good book.  

A.48:  Oh.  Uh-huh.

B.49:  I would highly recommend it.  Um, [lipsmack] it's not a mystery, uh, it is
of sorts and it's, it's really it's fiction but it's an excellent book.  I,

A.50:  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's interesting.  I, it sounds like, my, my novels that I
read I don't do that real often.  I'm like you I'm more into the self-help,
help and the, uh, of course, child rearing I like to read about that.  I have
four children and, and I like religious books also and, um, you know, that,
that's interesting that, that you read those type things.  Are they, are they
hard to understand?

B.51:  It depends.  I think I've learned through the years different books speak
to different people.

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  And I, you know, my recommendation is for people to try it and if, if they
can understand it they're supposed to read it, and if they can't, you know,
#then don't try.#

A.54:  #Put it away for another time.#  

B.55:  Uh-huh.  Because I really do think it depends on, on where people are at
the particular time,

A.56:  #Uh-huh.#

B.57:  #as to# whether or not they can read it.  And for me on certain books speak
to me and certain books do not.

A.58:  Oh.  

B.59:  So, you know, I-, and I just think not every book is for every person.

A.60:  Uh-huh.  I agree.

B.61:  These are not like, you know, best sellers so, um,

A.62:  Uh-huh.  Now when you go to the, do you get them from the library or,

B.63:  I tend to buy them.  

A.64:  Oh.  

B.65:  At a place here called Dallas Books,

A.66:  #Uh-huh.#

B.67:  #and it# has wonderful, um, wonderful books and I tend to get them there.
I have, I have a fairly expensive library now of, of things that I have read.

A.68:  #((Boy, that's something.))#

B.69:  #Uh, another person who's wonderful# who's more contemporary but who has
recently died is Thomas ((Murtin)).
 
A.70:  Oh.  

B.71:  And if you've read any of, he was a (( )) monk, 

A.72:  #Oh.# 

B.73:  #and# his writings are wonderful.   

A.74:  Huh.  

B.75:  And he was a prolific writer and, uh, you'll se-, if you know the name
you'll see it quoted often, um,

A.76:  #(( )).# 

B.77:  #and he,# he's really quite good, and I think his books are a, a tad easier
to read.

A.78:  #Oh.# 

B.79:  #You know,# I think that's a good place to start.  

A.80:  Uh-huh.

B.81:  Um, have you read Scott Peck?  That's another good place.  

A.82:  No, I haven't.  

B.83:  He wrote, this is what started me on all of it was THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED.

A.84:  Oh.  

B.85:  That was a, that's been a best seller.  

A.86:  Oh, yes, I'm that, now I'm familiar with the title.  I wasn't familiar with
h-, with his name but,

B.87:  Well he, um, [lipsmack] he's wonderful.  And I recommend that book to
anyone.

A.88:  Uh-huh.   

B.89:  Um, that is a great place to start.  

A.90:  Oh.  

B.91:  And so it's called THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED.  

A.92:  Oh, ((I'll have to go get that)).

B.93:  A wonderful book.  If you're into religious reading, um, and psychology 
(( )) he's, he's a psychiatrist --

A.94:  Oh.

B.95:  -- and he was converted late kind of late in life and it's sort of his
story --

A.96:  Oh.

B.97:  -- and it's quite good.  

A.98:  Huh.  

B.99:  Um,

A.100:  Now do you, um, when do you do your reading?  Do you,

B.101:  At night.  

A.102:  At night.  

B.103:  I tend to read at night.  

A.104:  That's when I do [laughter].

B.105:  Uh-huh.  I have, I have two children but they're eleven and fifteen so.

A.106:  Oh, they're a little bit older.  

B.107:  How old are your children?  

A.108:  Well, six months and three years and six years and eight years [laughter].

B.109:  Oh, goodness.  #You don't have time to do anything.#  

A.110:  #So that's the only time# I have to read is late at night, and sometimes
I'm too tired to do that.

B.111:  I bet [laughter]. 

@@A.112:  [Laughter] But I do love to read.

B.113:  Now are #you Mormon?# 

A.114:  #Yes, I am.#  Uh-huh.

B.115:  Okay.  I, I just assumed that because you're from Utah.  

A.116:  Yes.  Yes, I,

B.117:  But, uh,
