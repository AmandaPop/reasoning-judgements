A.1:  Okay, I now say Arlington, Texas since the other day I said that and
somebody said, well, I'm in Arlington, Virginia [laughter].

B.2:  Oh [laughter].  Well, that is a different thing, isn't it?  

A.3:  Yeah, I was really surprised and I got one person from Utah, but usually
it's right around here.

B.4:  Sure.  

A.5:  Well, what do you like in a restaurant [laughter]?  

@B.6:  Well, I guess I'd, I thought, well I guess I'd have to say the food
[laughter].

A.7:  I know, number one, that's #definitely it.#  

B.8:  #You know,# if the food is good, then that's, you know, that sort of makes
my decision.  I, you know, if I really have something good.  Although, okay,
be food and then the other thing I would say is atmosphere is real important
to me.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  

B.10:  You know, I don't like really noisy places and,

A.11:  Yeah, you know, I used to like to go to Friday's because I like kind of
lively #fun# --

B.12:  #Yes.#  

A.13:  -- places, but the last time we went there, it was so horrendously noisy
that I don't know if I'll [laughter] ever go back.

B.14:  Well, when a, when,

A.15:  It was awful.  

B.16:  I know, one of my pet peeves is that, you know, they have the music on so
loud --

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  -- and then people have to talk loud -- 

A.19:  That's right.  

B.20:  -- and then it's just so noisy that you can't visit.  

A.21:  Oh, I know.  

B.22:  You know, and normally, when I'm eating out I, you know, I'm with people
and I want to sit and talk.  I mean,

A.23:  That's the half the fun -- 

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  -- is the conversation, right.  

B.26:  You know, and I don't mind some noise, but if it's, -able for me, so, 
uh,

A.27:  I really think American restaurants are all, overall getting noisy, noisy,
people just screaming.

B.28:  I,

A.29:  I say that because I, the time I was in Europe years ago, you could be in a
tiny little restaurant, everyone talked lower, they still seemed to have fun
[laughter].

B.30:  Uh-huh.  Well, I don't know why.  I, in fact, I've been to places where
I've asked them to turn the music down --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- and, and they say, well, they, you know, they can't, that that's, the,
the atmosphere they want to promote and I, I don't understand that [laughter].

A.33:  I don't either.  

B.34:  You know, it's like that doesn't make sense to me.  What, you know, what is
the fun of that?

A.35:  I know.  I k-, and, uh, another one, you can tell I go to cheap
restaurants.  Now that I have a daughter in college, and I'm going [laughter],

B.36:  [Laughter]. 

A.37:  we go all the cheapies, but, we go to Cheddar's a lot.  There is one by us.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  And they'll just blast the T V w-, in the bar where you have to wait till
they call your name [laughter].

B.40:  Uh-huh.  

A.41:  You know, and, and I'm not that excited about some baseball game or
whatever they're, 

B.42:  Right.  

A.43:  It's just so loud, you can't even visit while you're having a drink or
anything.

B.44:  Well, another thing that is not my favorite thing [laughter] is, uh, you
know like if they have a [lipsmack] [breathing] birthdays and then they 
all,

A.45:  Oh, they all run screaming --   

B.46:  You know, #clap and scream to birthday,#

A.47:  -- #in and singing, yes# [laughter]. 

B.48:  I get tired of that, too [laughter].  

A.49:  They do, too, I think [laughter]. 

B.50:  So, you know, that, that, uh, the atmosphere does make a difference, but
usually I tend to go, well, for two reasons.  I go for the food, also
thinking, now, there is certain types of restaurants that I like.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  You know, I, I love Mexican food.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  And so I go to, I like Mexican food restaurants.  Uh,

A.55:  Right.  

B.56:  So I would go for that.  Uh, I (( )), what kind of restaurants do you
prefer or do you,

A.57:  Oh, golly, uh, I like most kinds of food, really.  I'd never go to a
barbecue place.  I mean, I don't mind barbecue, but that's one that we just
don't go out to.

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  But, w-, you know, I like Italian, and Mexican, and I love French and,

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  Uh, we don't, I don't even think we have a Greek restaurant in Arlington
[laughter].

B.62:  [Laughter]. 

A.63:  We, uh, I used to go to a Greek restaurant over in Dallas, couple of them.
I thought they were great.

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  Uh, I like most everything.  I like seafood, too.  Course, it's hard to get
my husband to a seafood restaurant [laughter].

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  But, another thing to consider is the, uh, help, you know.  

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  Uh, their attitude.  

B.70:  Right.  

A.71:  I, I think, and, uh,

B.72:  I, I agree.  

A.73:  Some of them, you know, they come up with all this phony [laughter] stuff,
too.  Hi, my name's Bill, I'm your waiter for the night.

B.74:  Right,

A.75:  [Laughter] Oh. 

B.76:  [Laughter] Right.  

A.77:  I'm tired of that.  

B.78:  Right, just wait on me and [laughter],    

A.79:  Right, I don't care about,

B.80:  I'll be happy.  

A.81:  Right, we don't have to exchange backgrounds [laughter].  But, uh, price is
something to consider.

B.82:  That's true, that's true.  

A.83:  But,

B.84:  Uh, and I, generally speaking, go to moderately priced pla-, you know,
places and it does matter, uh, you know, depending upon what my budget is for
the week as to where I go, I guess.

A.85:  Right.  

B.86:  Uh, but that's, yeah, that's right.  I, uh, price is definitely [laughter]
a consideration.

A.87:  Now the more expensive the restaurant, the more I want the h-, the waiters
to really wait on you and be good, you know [laughter].

B.88:  Uh-huh.  Well, they should be.  I mean, in theory, I guess.  

A.89:  Really, really, I think so.  Well, we went to New Orleans this fall and
talk about great restaurants [laughter].

B.90:  Yes.  

A.91:  Oh. 

B.92:  There is probably no place better.  I -- 

A.93:  Oh. 

B.94:  -- you know, the food in New Orleans is just fabulous.  

A.95:  Oh, I know and, uh, really, we, we went to Commander's Palace and --

B.96:  Oh. 

A.97:  -- and, you know, it was supposed to be one of the better ones in America.

B.98:  Yeah.  

A.99:  And, uh, our dinner that night, you could choose one that had like four
courses and it was thirty-nine dollars a dinner, but, my gosh, it was worth
it.  It was just beautiful surroundings.

B.100:  Yes.  

A.101:  At one time, there was five people waiting on our table.  

B.102:  Yeah, I've been there.  

A.103:  Oh, really?  

B.104:  It, yes, I have.  

A.105:  That's the first time, I've been in New Orleans before, was the first time
I'd eaten there.

B.106:  Uh,

A.107:  And I thought it was worth every penny.  

B.108:  It is.  It's a fabulous place.  

A.109:  And, uh, really enjoyed that, and then, I enjoyed that more than Brennan's.

B.110:  Uh-huh.  

A.111:  I think it's better.  

B.112:  Uh-huh.   

A.113:  But, still, Brennan's is so lovely and the service is so wonderful
[laughter].

B.114:  Well, they're all lovely.  

A.115:  That's true [laughter].  

B.116:  I mean, basically, you just can't go wrong and, uh, the food is just so
good.  I --

A.117:  Oh, I know.  

B.118:  -- I, I love New Orleans, and I,

A.119:  Well, they're lighthearted people there.
