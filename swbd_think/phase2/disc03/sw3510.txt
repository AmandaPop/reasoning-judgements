========================================================================

B.1:  Okay, but, you said you saw ROBIN HOOD?  

A.2:  Yes, I did, this summer.  Did you see it also?  

B.3:  Yeah, I sure did.  Of course, I'm a Kevin Costner fan [laughter].

A.4:  Well,  

B.5:  As are a lot of women.  

A.6:  I saw, I guess I've seen all of Kevin's movies, so far.  

B.7:  Yeah, have you, are you planning to see his new one, the J F K?

A.8:  Well, probably.  I want to see what the reviews look like.  

B.9:  Yeah, I usually wait for the reviews, too.  Although sometimes I've gone
and I disagree, you know, with them.  Not usually the paper as much as the
ones on radio and T V.  I don't always agree with them.

A.10:  Well, sometimes it's a matter of what the movie is about.  

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  Even if it doesn't get a good review, if it's something I'm interested in,
I'll probably go see it anyway.

B.13:  Oh, like the man on the, uh, I think it's K R L D that reviews movies gave,
uh, STAR TREK, the new movie, uh, like a four or five and I was surprised
because everyone that's a STAR TREK fan that I know that has seen it just
loved it.

A.14:  Well I've, I've read some reviews [throat_clearing] on STAR TREK and was
planning to see it.  WALL STREET JOURNAL has a review today and it says
basically that, uh, that this is probably just about the best one that they've
ever done.

B.15:  Uh-huh, so don't you think, again, it's a matter of opinion? 

A.16:  Sure, it finishes by, if this is indeed the final voyage of the original
crew, STAR TREK SIX is a worthy valediction.

B.17:  Uh, I don't like always to listen to what someone else says, uh, because I
think sometimes they just don't happen to, or if, you know, if you're real
tired sometimes, something doesn't appeal to you.

A.18:  Well, that, that can be the case, or it can get a great review and be
something that I'm not interested in.

B.19:  [Laughter] That's right.  

A.20:  Then I'm not going to see it.  

B.21:  I've seen a couple like that.  Uh, you haven't seen CAPE FEAR yet?

A.22:  No, I've been reading,  

B.23:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.24:  all the reviews about it, but I've never seen it.  

B.25:  Oh, it is very, very frightening.  I mean, I think it's more so than
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  It's a little bit like that.  Did you see SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS?

A.26:  No, but I read all about it, too.  

B.27:  [Laughter] Yeah, well,  

A.28:  [Laughter]. 

B.29:  it was pretty gory and so was CAPE FEAR.  Real, kind of gruesome.  But,
you know, that's kind of like, when is he going to die and probably never.

A.30:  This movie HOOK is getting interesting reviews.  Some are saying that it's
too sweet.  Uh, just because they spent so much money on it and it's got such
well-known stars, I'm thinking about seeing it.

B.31:  Which one is that?  

A.32:  It's called HOOK.  It's,  

B.33:  HOOK, yes.  Again, I've heard mixed reviews on that, you know.  I think
this morning K R L D had a, gave it a, a six or something, which for him is
probably pretty good.

A.34:  Well, the newspaper suggested,  

B.35:  [Cough]. 

A.36:  that it's perhaps too sweet a movie and, and that the action sequences
might not be as good as other Spielberg movies, but it might not be bad
overall.

B.37:  I guess there will never be another E T. 

A.38:  No.  

B.39:  I know that was a classic, and I'm glad they didn't try to follow up with a
sequel.  Sometimes it ruins it.

A.40:  Well, no.  E, E, E T. is going to, stood as an instant classic.

B.41:  Well, I think so, uh, it was on, what, Thanksgiving, I was in Florida and I
watched it again.  Have you seen THE BUTCHER'S WIFE?

A.42:  No, that's the one with Demi Moore?  

B.43:  Uh-huh.  

A.44:  Yeah, I've, I've been reading about it, but I wasn't all that interested.
J-, well, Jeff Daniels is in that, too, isn't he?

B.45:  Uh-huh.  

A.46:  But, I, I wasn't interested. 

B.47:  He does put in a real good, it's a real lighthearted movie.  If you are,
uh, in the mood to see something just kind of lighthearted, you would like it.
It isn't a real thoughtful picture.  Just kind of fun, you know.  Once in a
while, it's nice to just go see something that's just lighthearted and fun.

A.48:  Well, sometimes, there are two kind of movies that I like to see.  The ones
on the big screen like STAR TREK where you really have to see them on big
screen and then the others, like, say, THE BUTCHER'S WIFE that are
interesting, but you can rent them later and watch them on T V, 

B.49:  [Cough]. 

A.50:  without any harm, by watching on video.  

B.51:  [Cough] That's true.  You know, and you have to start thinking about, is
it, is it worth spending [laughter] the money to go see it, or shall I just
wait.

A.52:  Well, you know, STAR WARS, STAR TREK, those kind of movies, you have got to
see them on big screen or else they --

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  -- lose their effect.  

B.55:  They really do and I've never been a STAR TREK fan, but I have friends and
relatives that wouldn't miss a STAR TREK movie.

A.56:  Well, I, I've enjoyed STAR TREK, but I got people, friends who are
fanatics, and I have a friend who took off work last Friday just to be sure to
be in the first group to see it.  Well,

B.57:  Um.  

A.58:  I'll see, I'll see it eventually, but -- 

B.59:  Yeah.  

A.60:  -- I'm not going to rush.  

B.61:  Well, and sometimes, you know, you miss all the crowds if you don't have to
go the very [laughter] first day it opens.

A.62:  No, I, I -- 

B.63:  Yeah.  

A.64:  -- think it will still be playing next month.  

B.65:  Yeah, I think so.  I don't think you need to be one of the first.  Uh, do
you belong to any of the fan clubs, or,

A.66:  Oh, no, no.  I'm --

B.67:  You know, the,  

A.68:  -- I'm just, it's just interesting to watch.  

B.69:  Uh-huh.  

A.70:  Although, there is a big story in the paper today, a debate between two of
the writers, one saying the original crew was best and one saying the new crew
was best, but, uh, you know, the debate goes on, I suppose.

B.71:  Yeah, well, it would be interesting to hear why people think that,
