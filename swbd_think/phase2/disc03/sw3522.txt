REMARKS:        Speaker B was hard to understand.  He mumbled quite
a bit and had a very low voice

=============================================================================

A.1:  Where did you go on your last vacation?  

B.2:  Um, let's see, uh, the last vacation I started to, started to take, I say,
uh, was with a friend of mine.  Uh, we were going to go down to, uh, South
Padre and we got down there and it was rainy and yucky and we decided just --

A.3:  Oh. 

B.4:  -- turn around and come back.  

A.5:  Now, that's someplace I've never been.  I'd like to go down there.

B.6:  Yeah {very faint}.

A.7:  Because I've o-, only lived here in Texas for two years, so --

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  -- I haven't had a chance to go down there.  

B.10:  It's, it's a, it's a really fun place.  It's, as long as it's not raining.

A.11:  Yeah.  What do you do down there?  

B.12:  Oh, sit out by the little [breathing] (( )) beach.  

A.13:  Yeah.  

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  Well,   

B.16:  And, uh, there is lots of really good places to eat and, uh, I haven't
really had a chance to check out any of the, the real entertainment or
anything, but, uh, uh, it's, there is lots of, you know, areas to do things --

A.17:  Yeah.  

B.18:  -- on South Padre itself.  

A.19:  Um.  Well, I'm getting ready to go to Arizona for Christmas and in New
Mexico we're going to do some skiing so I'm real anxious to do that.

B.20:  I have never been skiing.  

A.21:  Oh, it's a lot, well, last year was the first time I've ever gone and it
was so much fun.  I really enjoyed it.  I took a lesson the first day and then
the second day I was up on the beginner's slope.

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  But it looks, it, it, you think that, that, uh, you wonder what those
people are doing on the mountain, you know.

B.24:  Uh-huh.  

A.25:  But you get up there yourself and it's so much fun.  

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Makes you feel like a kid again.  

B.28:  And the good people make it look easy [laughter].  

A.29:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.30:  You're going, hey, how do I stand up?  

A.31:  [Laughter]. 

B.32:  Bump [laughter].  

A.33:  So I'm really anxious to go skiing again.  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  Y-, uh, you remember how you were when you were a kid and you went down a
sled?

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  Well that's, 

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  the way you feel on skis.  

B.40:  That's how I felt when I tried to go water, when I, the first time I went
water skiing so, 

A.41:  Oh, now, see, I haven't done that.  

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  I haven't been water skiing.  

B.44:  Water, water skiing is a blast.  

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  You just, a, a little bit of, of, uh, upper arm stamina just to, to hold
on to the ropes so the boat doesn't jerk your arms out of socket.

A.47:  Um.  

B.48:  You have a lot of fun.   

A.49:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, where all have you been on vacation?  

B.50:  Oh,  

A.51:  Have you been to Disneyland?  

B.52:  With my family, I've gone down to Florida, I think it, I think they have
the Disneyworld down there.

A.53:  Yeah, I haven't been down there.  

B.54:  Long before they ever put in EPCOT Center and all the fun stuff.

A.55:  Oh. 

B.56:  And, uh, I've been to Washington, D C and all,  

A.57:  Oh, now, see, I haven't been there either.  

B.58:  All, all through that area, uh, and I've been up through the Yellowstone,
all the national parks up that way.

A.59:  Gee, you've been around a lot.  

B.60:  Yeah, and we went as far as Canada on that trip.  And I've been all over
Texas.  There is, there is, there is nowhere in Texas I haven't been I don't
think, except some of the far west Texas little, pinholes [laughter].

A.61:  Yeah.  

B.62:  Yeah.  

A.63:  Have you been to Carlsbad Caverns?  

B.64:  Yeah, I've been there.  

A.65:  Yeah, well,  

B.66:  At least once.  Uh, the, the only place I haven't been really is California
and New York.

A.67:  Well,  

B.68:  The, the two,  

A.69:  You didn't miss anything.  I've been to both places. 

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  You didn't miss anything.  

B.72:  (( )),  

A.73:  Just lots of people.  

B.74:  The only thing that really, I've, I've been in California, but I've never
vacationed there.  Got on an airplane here in Dallas and landed in California
and, uh, then got on a cruise ship, went up and down the coast a couple of
times.

A.75:  Oh, shoot, you went on a cruise?  

B.76:  Yeah, my,  

A.77:  You've done everything.  

B.78:  My parents took me on a cruise when I was in the sixth grade. 

A.79:  [Laughter]. 

B.80:  [Breathing] It was such a good deal, they just couldn't pass it up.

A.81:  Yeah.  

B.82:  Yeah.  It, it wasn't that great of a cruise actually.  It was, it was seven
days and I was fairly bored.

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  At, at my age, it, it wasn't that much fun because there weren't a lot of
kids on there at that time of year.  I was --

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  -- it was during the school year, so,  

A.87:  Oh.  But I'll bet it was interesting out there on the boat in the water --

B.88:  Yeah.  

A.89:  -- and everything.  

B.90:  Yeah, seeing the dolphins and -- 

A.91:  Yeah, you still,  

B.92:  -- stuff like that.  

A.93:  Uh-huh.  

B.94:  #It was great at the time# -- 

A.95:  #You still learned a lot.#

B.96:  -- though, because I got out of school for a week. 

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  [Laughter].

A.99:  Well, then you haven't been to Disneyland in California, then, have you?

B.100:  No, I haven't.  

A.101:  Well, now, that's someplace you should go.  That's really neat.

B.102:  Yeah.  

A.103:  I moved over there, I,  

B.104:  [Cough]. 

A.105:  lived there for a little while real close to there and we, we were just
like five miles from there --

B.106:  Yeah.  

A.107:  -- and we would drive down there and, and the kids, they, I have two sons
and they were on the newspaper route and they'd keep giving them, uh, passes
to get in.
