==========================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  Uh, I guess, uh, you know, I really, I remember what school was like
when I grew up, and, uh, you know, back then, I believe, I really do believe
people had more respect for teachers back then.

A.2:  Well, that's what I was thinking.  The discipline just isn't there 
anymore --

B.3:  Uh-huh.  

A.4:  -- like it used to be.  

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  And they've lost, the teachers have lost control.   

B.7:  Yeah, I agree.  And, I don't know, you know, I think some of that stems
with the parents but,

A.8:  I think so, too. 

B.9:  I, I think some of it also stems with just society in general because
teachers aren't looked, looked upon as, you know, like, with as much respect
as they use the to be.

A.10:  That's right.  

B.11:  Because back then, you know, if you were a teacher, people used to think,
oh, you know, that, you know, that's great.  And nowadays if you're a teacher,
it's like, oh, you had nothing else that you could come up with to do so you
decided to go into teaching.

A.12:  Yeah.  

B.13:  You know, it's like,

A.14:  Well, they didn't used to sue the teachers like they're doing now.

B.15:  Yeah, that, too.  

A.16:  And that's why the teachers are in so much trouble.  

B.17:  That's true.  That's true.  

A.18:  That's really too bad that the teachers don't have control over the
students like they used to.

B.19:  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, my wife's a teacher, but she teaches preschool.

A.20:  And, see, the, uh, parents used to back up the teachers, too. 

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  They would sit, they would tell the kids, now, you do what your teacher
says.

B.23:  Uh-huh.  

A.24:  And -- 

B.25:  That's right.  

A.26:  -- the teacher would let them know if they weren't doing the right thing
and the parents would be right there on the kids but,

B.27:  That's right.  And it seems to me like now it's just the opposite.  In, in,
in a lot of cases.

A.28:  That's right.  

B.29:  You know.  

A.30:  That's right.  

B.31:  Uh,

A.32:  Parents are behind their kids now.  

B.33:  Right.  

A.34:  And they believe the things that they say about the teachers so,

B.35:  Uh-huh.  Yeah I,

A.36:  I don't know how they would correct it.  

B.37:  [Breathing] Yeah, yeah and I also don't believe that, you know, uh, you
know, physical punishment is, is really the answer, either.

A.38:  No.  

B.39:  Uh,

A.40:  I don't believe that, either.  

B.41:  Uh, because, you know, a lot of kids, and, you know, they get that at home.
You know, they don't need it at school either.  They need some other way of --

A.42:  Right.  

B.43:  -- of discipline that's, you know, it's going to, uh, more or less, you
know, snap the child around and, and get them, you know, just, just earn some
respect.

A.44:  Right.  

B.45:  I mean, anybody can beat up -- 

A.46:  Well,

B.47:  -- on anybody else.  

A.48:  They should just, for the discipline at school, they should just, uh, take
away some of their things that they enjoy the most.

B.49:  Yeah, yeah, I guess it really would, it doesn't matter what age the child
is, you know, anywhere from preschool to, you know, teenagers.  You know, you
take away what they, what they want and enjoy, then they're going to pay
attention to you.

A.50:  Right, right.  

B.51:  That's true.  

A.52:  I have a sister that's a first grade teacher.  

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  She teaches first grade.  

B.55:  Uh-huh.  

A.56:  And she just, she thoroughly enjoys the kids.  

B.57:  Yes.  

A.58:  She really likes them.  

B.59:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.60:  And I'm going to, I'm going back to school.  I'm going to start back in
January and get my teaching certificate.  I'm going to teach high school.

B.61:  Ooh [laughter], you're brave.  

A.62:  [Laughter] I'm going to be a home ec teacher.  

B.63:  Uh-huh.  

A.64:  [Laughter]. 

B.65:  You know, I, I think maybe it might not be too bad of an idea.  I don't
know if you've seen the movie where the, the principal cracks down on the kids
and he says, okay, let me know who all the trouble makers are and they're out
of here.  And I'm wondering how practical that is to apply to, you know, to
all the schools.

A.66:  Yeah.  

B.67:  I mean, I wonder if that would work or not or what kind of alternative they
could provide for these, you know, troubled kids and trouble makers, that type
of thing.

A.68:  Well, you know the ma-, there's a, really, another big problem and that's
the drop out problem now.

B.69:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.70:  All the kids of dropping out and I think it's because the parents don't
tell them they can't.

B.71:  Yeah, that's right.  

A.72:  Parents don't, don't, uh, you know, the kids say, well, I don't want to do
that anymore and then the parents say, well, okay, whatever you think.  And
that's was, that wasn't that way when I was a kid.

B.73:  Yeah, that's true.  

A.74:  We'd say, why do we have to do that and the parent would say because I told
you so.

B.75:  [Laughter]. 

A.76:  [Laughter]. 

B.77:  Right.  

A.78:  And you do what I say.  

B.79:  Right.  

A.80:  And they f-, they've, they've, uh, lost whoever is supposed to take charge
here.

B.81:  Yeah it, it's getting to the point where, you know, where, well, you
know, it's kind of, with both parents having to work, it's really hard to, 
uh --

A.82:  That has a lot to do with it.

B.83:  -- # to have the strength. # 

A.84:  Uh-huh, they can't watch over their kids anymore like they used to.

B.85:  Yeah, yeah.  And then when mom and dad do give notice at home, then, you
know, they're too tired from working all day long.  They just as soon let them
do whatever they want and --

A.86:  [Laughter] Yeah.  

B.87:  -- don't bother me, I'm tired.  

A.88:  Yeah.   It's really too bad.  

B.89:  And that doesn't help either.  That's true.  

A.90:  Because it depends on what they do in school as how they're going to do
their future things in life.

B.91:  Yeah, that's true.  Especially, I think at the younger ages, uh,
elementary, you know, I think maybe, you know, I hate to even say, you know,
one teacher teaching a certain grade is, is higher priority than another
teacher, but, there's so much of, of what they experience in their early 
years --

A.92:  Oh, that's right.  

B.93:  -- sets the pattern.   

A.94:  They need the basics, too, in the education.  They need that reading and
writing.

B.95:  Uh-huh.
