REMARKS:        Speakers sounded similar.  They also used a lot of
computer terms that were hard to understand.

=======================================================================

B.1:  Hi, well, I guess, w-, which one have you got right now?  Or,

A.2:  Well, I, uh, couple of them, I, at the moment, use an A S T two eighty-six
and I got a leading edge and I got a American one and had a I B M one, but
[laughter],

B.3:  [Laughter]  My, my, just a couple.  

A.4:  What do you have [laughter]?  

B.5:  Uh, I've got an Omega and I've got a, uh, generic three eighty, or four
eighty-six machine.

A.6:  Oh, yeah?  

B.7:  Yeah, it's very, very generic.  

A.8:  What did you do, put it together?  

B.9:  Yeah, and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and
dabbled and --

A.10:  Well, that's,  

B.11:  -- now, now it's, now it's a fast machine [laughter].  

A.12:  Yeah.  

B.13:  That's all I got to say for it.  

A.14:  Yeah.  What do you use it for?  

B.15:  [Noise] Huh?  

A.16:  What do you use it for?  

B.17:  Uh, work, uh, I'm a contract programmer.  

A.18:  Oh, yeah?  What kind of programs do you,  

B.19:  Uh, anything [laughter].  

A.20:  Okay, I mean like business programs or,  

B.21:  Uh, I've done business programming, scien-, you know, scientific
applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and,

A.22:  Man.  

B.23:  Uh, uh, test equipment and I did the, I, I did one that was, the
demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch
screens.  It was kind of fun.

A.24:  Uh-huh, 

B.25:  Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display.

A.26:  Huh.  

B.27:  And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and ((
)), and --

A.28:  Well, that's, 

B.29:  -- all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen
for.

A.30:  [Laughter] Well, that sounds interesting. 

B.31:  [Throat_clearing].

A.32:  Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there,
I imagine, huh.

B.33:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  

A.34:  That's where the speed helps out.  

B.35:  Uh, yeah, unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the
back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six.  It's like
slow {dragged out the word}.

A.36:  Yep, that will, that will,

B.37:  [Laughter]. 

A.38:  slow you up [laughter].  

B.39:  Huh?

A.40:  Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and --

B.41:  Uh-huh.  

A.42:  -- uh, cat cam system type things and, uh, really need a faster system.
Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam
systems, and tooling, et cetera.

B.43:  Uh-huh.  

A.44:  Uh,  

B.45:  I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.  

A.46:  Who is that?  

B.47:  [Breathing] Uh, his name is T Q or something like that.  And my notebook
is somewhere around here [groan].  See if I can make my telephone cord stretch
far enough.

A.48:  I've tried to do is get this outfit to -- 

B.49:  Uh, he's, uh, up in,  

A.50:  -- give me one [laughter].  

B.51:  Huh?  

A.52:  That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them.  They not
only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.

B.53:  Uh-huh.  

A.54:  And as they,  

B.55:  Oh, that works.  

A.56:  And as they go to the next one I just keep the, [laughter] that's why I
have so many different levels of P C -s around at the moment.

B.57:  Uh, here it is.  A T S Computers.  

A.58:  A T S?

B.59:  Uh-huh.  

A.60:  And where are they at?  

B.61:  Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?  

A.62:  Oh, yeah.  

B.63:  Okay, he's, uh, uh, south of Renner on, on Custer.  

A.64:  (( )).  

B.65:  And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of
center.

A.66:  In Richardson there.  

B.67:  Huh?  

A.68:  In Richardson?  

B.69:  Uh-huh.  

A.70:  I know where you mean.  There is a Mobil and all that kind of s-, uh, on
that one corner, that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.

B.71:  Right, it's, it's, it's just south of there.  

A.72:  Yeah.  

B.73:  It's a little place, looks like a castle.  

A.74:  Yeah.  

B.75:  Kind of, uh, little guy in there.  He, [throat_clearing] he, uh, gives
reasonable prices.

A.76:  Oh. 

B.77:  Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about
six hundred.

A.78:  Really?  Well, that's a good deal.  

B.79:  Yeah, it was pretty reasonable.  

A.80:  Yeah.  

B.81:  But, uh, uh, he, and he does a good job and he, s-, he, he, uh, guarantees
everything he sells.

A.82:  Uh, there is a lot, you ever go by Lucky Computer there?  

B.83:  Uh-huh, yeah.  

A.84:  I used to, when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd
go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff
with our systems.

B.85:  Uh-huh.  

A.86:  Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so.  So I, I don't
know where those guys are at these days.  But I, (( )),

B.87:  Uh, they, they're up there in that mall.  Uh, just below Campbell.

A.88:  Yeah.  

B.89:  Or that strip, strip, center.  

A.90:  Yeah.  

B.91:  They're still doing business.  Big business, apparently.  

A.92:  [Laughter] I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.

B.93:  Uh-huh, oh, yeah, I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for
six hundred even with a trade in, you know, it's like, wow [laughter].

A.94:  Yeah.  

B.95:  That works, I'll go do that [laughter].  

A.96:  [Laughter] I,  

B.97:  And boy that thing screams now.  

A.98:  Yeah, I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed,

B.99:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.100:  the three eighty-six.  That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.

B.101:  Uh-huh.  Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three
eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.

A.102:  Is that right?  That's it?  

B.103:  Yeah, it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.

A.104:  I'll be darned.  

B.105:  Yeah.

A.106:  Huh, well,
