========================================================================

A.1:  Well, what, uh, what kind of recycling have you got in your community?

B.2:  Well, in our community we recycle everything.  

@A.3:  Really?  

B.4:  Oh, yeah, we recycle plastic, we recycle aluminum, we recycle paper, we
recycle everything.

A.5:  Well, now, do you participate in all of that?  

B.6:  Well, my wife does.  I'm not real high on it myself.  How about,

A.7:  Well, I think, I think that's great that she does that.  I, I'll applaud
that.  Uh,

B.8:  Do you do that?

A.9:  No, and I, I, as a matter of fact, I kind of cringed a little bit whenever
I heard the topic, because I think it's admirable, and I think it's something
that eventually we're, we're all going to have to do it.  Uh, I don't, but, I
know the,

B.10:  Do you realize, Glen, that, the latest FORBES magazine pointed out that it
actually costs more to recycle than it does not to recycle?

A.11:  Uh, it costs more in what way?  

B.12:  Well, newspapers, for example, for recycling papers to get rid of the ink
it costs about thirty-two percent more to recycle paper than it does to have
new paper.

A.13:  Well, that's interesting, and I've, you know, I wouldn't, I, I mean, I
hadn't heard that, Bob, and that's, that's a little surprising, but, you know,
I think about the amount of, of newspaper that I throw away in a week, and,
you know, you multiply that with all the people, uh, I'm in Houston that are,
that are tossing out newspapers and it, I remember I, I was in New York
several years ago and I took the wrong turn [noise] and I went over into, uh,
Staten Island where the, uh, uh, landfill is for New York City --

B.14:  Yes.  

A.15:  -- and, of course, that's not where I wanted to be, so I turned around and
beat it by hasty retreat,

B.16:  [Laughter].  

A.17:  but, you know, just the, the amount of garbage that we generate, uh, is, is
staggering.  And I just, I don't know how much longer we can continue to just
dump everything.

B.18:  Well, it's, uh, it's a problem that, uh, is probably at the moment
overemphasized because there is apparently more landfill available than, it's
a matter of economics.

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  And economically right now, uh, it's more of a scare tactic, it appears,
that we are running out of things and in fact in some cases are.

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  Particularly paper, which, trees obviously, by being a renewable resource,
and being a crop no more different than corn, in effect.  It's a situation
that, of economics, where it's less expensive to have new newspaper than using
and, recycling old paper.

A.23:  Yeah, and I can, I can understand that.  I think, I think about, uh, you
know, and they say that now, uh, a lot of the new cars, for instance, I read
an article not long ago about this, uh, uh, new Honda that they had come out
that they're identifying on the car those, uh, particular different parts, uh,
uh, that are plastic so that, that whenever the car is worn out and
dismantled, uh --

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  -- they can recycle the, the plastic components.  

B.26:  Those are, uh, plastic, is very recyclable and, uh, should be.  Uh, that's
something that just won't go away when you dispose of it and, uh --

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  -- plastics and, and your metals are very worthwhile being recycles.  It's,
uh,

A.29:  It's just a matter right now of who's going to take the time, uh, to do it.
And I, I mean, it's something that I personally feel is, it, it's worthwhile,
I just, uh, I haven't gotten into it and, uh, I, I think I'm probably like a
lot of people in that, uh, until it gets to the point that it's kind of
mandated, uh, I don't think I'm, I'm going to do it, unfortunately.  Uh,

B.30:  What, what city do you live in?  

A.31:  In Houston.  

B.32:  Well in, I live in Plano and, uh, they have a very big recycling program
where, uh, for your grass clippings, for example, if you don't put them in a
paper sack, they won't pick them up.  They have special pick up days for, for,
uh, leaves and debris, uh, you know, clippings type thing.  And if you put it
in a plastic one, they won't pick it up.

A.33:  Really?  

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  I saw an article, I mean, a, a program on a T B S not too long ago that,
uh, [throat_clearing] they were talking about, uh, recycling and they, uh,
were showing [breathing], uh, in a city, I think it was Portland, Oregon, if I
remember, it was either, but i-, it was either in Washington or Oregon, and,
of course, you know, those people up there are very, uh, uh, environmentally
conscious, and they were talking about the, the recycling effort up there and
how they've got, uh, uh, all these different bins and containers and,

B.36:  That's what they're coming out with here -- 

A.37:  Really?  

B.38:  -- matter of fact.

A.39:  Yeah.  

B.40:  I haven't received ours, yet, but, uh, that's the plan in Plano, also.
They, uh, bring out these ((Humpty Dump-,)) bins and you're supposed to
[laughter] fill it up with,

A.41:  And I [laughter], and you know, and I'll tell you, when you, you know, and
I've been accustomed all my life to throwing everything in one bag and then,
uh, dumping it in the dumpster, it's going to be a rude awakening to have to,
uh, start sorting everything.

B.42:   Well, I, I frank-,
