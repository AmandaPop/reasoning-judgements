=======================================================================

B.1:  had to, uh, face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home?

A.2:  Well, it's a topic that, um, my husband and I often discuss because, um, I
don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased, so, um, we think about
that often times with my father, but there's plenty of other siblings to help
out.  However, on my husband's side, um, he has one sibling who is mentally
retarded, and, um, and then his parents, and so we wonder, you know, how we're
going to make ends meet once they're gone.

B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  Um, you know, my mother-in-law constantly says things like, you know, well,
I wish, if one of us goes, I wish we'd all go, like in a car [laughter]
accident, so that nobody would help, nobody would have to worry about it, but,
uh --

B.5:  Yeah.

A.6:  -- um, it's a scary issue I think. 

B.7:  Well, I've been very fortunate.  Uh, my father, uh, was very careful in,

A.8:  [Throat_clearing].

B.9:  laying plans for his, uh, latter years --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- and he was very concerned that, uh, mother be provided for, so he went
through a process over a period of about five years deciding where he wanted
to be, and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm and, uh, invested
in a, uh, nursing home in Central Virginia --

A.12:  Um.

B.13:  -- and, uh, moved in there, and, uh, he made that decision on his own, and,
uh, he made a good choice.  He found one that had, uh, pleasant conditions
for, for him and mother living together, and it had a, uh, nursing home
attached to it.

A.14:  Um.

B.15:  And everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because, uh, they moved
into the, uh, to the retirement home in August, and he died in September --

A.16:  Wow.

B.17:  -- just, just before his, uh, uh, eightieth birthday.

A.18:  Wow, wow.

B.19:  And, uh, it was fortunate that, uh, uh, he had made those provisions
because at that point, uh, mother had, uh, Alzheimer's disease --

A.20:  Um.

B.21:  -- and her mental faculties were going very rapidly, and that's, that's
something that's very stressful to handle.

A.22:  Yes, I know.

B.23:  So, uh, we were very --

A.24:  One.

B.25:  -- fortunate in having her in the right spot.

A.26:  Um, I think that's kind of the ideal situation, is to have a combination
retirement home, nursing home, and even, you know, if they need special care,
um, my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home, and I don't think they've
termed what she has as Alzheimer's, but it's, you know, she reverts a lot back
to her childhood, and she doesn't know who you are.  Often ti-, often times
she does.  The one thing that she retains, as far as her memory is concerned,
is, um, hymns --

B.27:  Uh-huh.

A.28:  -- you know, religious hymns.  She can sing them, um, and remember all the
verses, but when you talk to her, she [laughter] doesn't know who you are.
But, the home that she is in, uh, it seems like a nice home, but there are a
lot of people there that are really bad, badly off.  And they have them all
combined together.

B.29:  Uh-huh.

A.30:  And so her roommate, um, is, um, a person who entered herself into the home
because she has really bad arthritis, but mentally she is completely there.
So [whistling] {mechanical}, you know, I don't know about that type of
situation where, you know, you have a mixture, but there is a home here in
Dallas that, um, it's a Methodist home, um, for the elderly,
[throat_clearing], and they have that kind of situation it seems like what you
were talking about with your parents.

B.31:  Uh-huh.

A.32:  Retirement home and a nursing home, you know, and even a hospital,
somewhat, attached, you know, for those who need, you know, really special
care.  And I think that would what, be what I would desire if, if I had to,
one of those.  Um, that's about,

B.33:  Yeah, my, uh, I have, uh, an aunt who's in a, uh, home in Charlotte, North
Carolina, and they, they had planned on that for a number of years, and
actually, uh, made the payment on the condominium or the apartment, uh, oh,
fifteen years before they moved in --

A.34:  Oh, really?

B.35:  -- and, uh, so when my aunt finally got to the point, her eyesight
deteriorated, and she could no longer drive, and it was getting awkward to get
to the store for groceries and things like that --

A.36:  Um.

B.37:  -- and, uh, she moved in.  It was only about, oh, it's walking distance to
where she lived [laughter] --

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  -- so she retained all her old friends and, uh, they, they look after her,
and they serve pretty good meals.  Um, it's kind of amazing the disparity that
exists between some,
