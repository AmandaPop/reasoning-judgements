============================================================================

A.1:  Yeah, what do you think about our level of funding to the Middle East
((trust))?

@B.2:  Oh, I, I think we could use a lot of it at home.  But definitely a hot
spot is the ((poor last year)) (( )).  A lot of,

A.3:  Yeah, I was, I was thinking while I was waiting to be connected with, uh,
uh, another party.  You know, I got real ambivalent, uh, kind of mixed
feelings about it.  I mean I agree with you.  I think, you know, jeez, there's
an awful lot of money that we go over there to people that [breathing] seem to
be [breathing], uh, shall we say less than appreciative.

B.4:  I agree [laughter].

A.5:  And at, and, and at the same time, uh, you know, I think it's important for
us that, you know, there is some sort of stability in that region [breathing].
But, I don't know, then again you, uh, historically there has such a history
of, uh, you know, just be-, being constantly in turmoil, that I don't know if
we can throw enough dollars at them to, you know, keep any kind of a lasting
[breathing] peace over there.  [Breathing] So I don't, it's, it's, I, I guess
bottom line if I had to, uh, to call the shot I would like to see th-, the
money spent a little more, uh, judiciously.

B.6:  Uh, I, I agree.  I like the, I like the, the peace process, spend more
money on things like that.  And especially with, um, I don't know, the
[breathing] Palestinian's and the Israelis fighting so much over who is going
to go to this peace conference.  I'd tie some of the money to those peace
conferences.  If they don't want to go to the peace conference, then I guess
they don't want the two billion dollars for the next batch of F fifteens or
whatever.

A.7:  Oh, yeah, yeah.

B.8:  Which we'll never do but --

A.9:  Yep, yep, right.

B.10:  -- I think it is about time.  Especially with the Israelis that we,
[breathing] because many times in the past they've, you know, they're happy to
take our money and stuff, but they often times fail to give us any support in
return.

A.11:  Yeah, well that was exactly who I, I was thinking about whenever I made the
comment of, uh, you know, money going to people that seem less than
appreciative [breathing].  I mean they're, they're ready to take it and we se-,
you know, have, have set, uh, a precedence over the history with them of
always having an open pocket book [breathing].  Uh, and, uh, you know they've
just have grown to expect it.  And, uh, [breathing] I don't mind, uh, helping
people that, [breathing] I mean, I don't expect somebody to gravel but at the
same time don't, uh, you know, take the money and, and then, uh, slap me in
the face.

B.12:  Right.  Well, uh, they, they seem to do a lot of that.  So --

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  -- the problem I have, [breathing] in the past at least, it was, you know,
they were very sta-, strategically important to us.  But I think that's
diminished a lot lately too.

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  Especially with the relationship we've started to develop with Saudi Arabia
#after,#

A.17:  #Right.#

B.18:  the Gulf War and all [breathing].  And I don't know, maybe we could use
that to our advantage [breathing], At least if we are going to be giving them
all this money, then at least, you know, we should get som-, at least some
cooperation or whatever in return.

A.19:  Yeah.  The one good thing about the Gulf War, I, I mean there was several
good things about it, but it was [breathing] one of the few things that we've
ever done as a, as a country that I think practically paid for itself.

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  And certainly there are countries over there that have the ((where
with all)) to, uh, uh, foot their fair share of the bill.

B.22:  Well, that's for sure.

A.23:  Yeah. 

B.24:  And we built some good friends over there now with, uh, time when we can
use them.  #You know, little ru-,#

A.25:  #Yeah, and,# and, we built, we built some good friends and then we've also
built some arch enemies.  So it's, you know, it's one tit for tat sort of.

B.26:  Right.  Well, most of the large enemies were large enemies to begin with
though.

A.27:  That's true.

B.28:  There's not too many people that went from being our friends to being our
enemies #but there's,#

A.29:  #That's right,# that's right.  I, I,

B.30:  quite a few that have been from our enemies to at least tolerating us, #or
whate-,# 

A.31:  #Well,# yeah.  Especially when if you look back at what (( )) you know,
that many years ago, I mean back in the early seventies whenever the, the
Saudi's embargoed, uh, oil to the U S.

B.32:  Right.

A.33:  We've certainly come a long way since then.

B.34:  That's right.  Uh, and I don't know, Ira-, Iran now wants them to
reestablish more normal relationships with us.  I don't know if that is in our
[laughter] best interests either.  But [breathing] it's good that, I don't
know, i-, it seems slightly more stable now, but how long that lasts, you
know, it can, history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm.

A.35:  Yeah, right.  Right.  Well, it's, [breathing] you know, like I say just as,
uh, as, uh, uh, region, I don't know of any, uh, other part of the world that,
uh, i-, is so prone to change quickly.  And, and I don't know this seems like,
you know, they're these, uh, deep seeded hostilities and animosities --

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  -- that are just, uh, [breathing] handed down generation to generation.

B.38:  Well, they have the, all the religious battles.  They have the nationalist
battle.  They just seem to have a lot of different cultures and religions,
nationalisms all packed into that one small geographical area.  They all
believe that they have rights to these lands.  You know these two, three, four
groups that all believe that this portion of land rightfully is theirs.

A.39:  Right [laughter].

B.40:  Hopefully, you know, optimistically, ma-, maybe something, you know, I
don't think it's all going to be rosie after this latest round of peace talks,
but hopefully it can be a start at least in the right direction.

A.41:  Yeah.  Well I do like your idea of tying, uh,
