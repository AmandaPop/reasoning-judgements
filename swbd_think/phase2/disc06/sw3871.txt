=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, what do you think about recycling?

@B.2:  Well, it certainly would, would help things out.  Uh, I don't see a
terribly lot of it going on here.

A.3:  I don't see a lot of it here either.

B.4:  I was actually quite surprised.  I went to, uh, San Francisco, uh, recently
--

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- out to Berkeley and, and, uh, they actually have mandatory re-, well,
uh, no their is not mandatory, I'm sorry, uh, but, you know, it was just
incredible to see, [laughter] everybody with you know with tin bags of things
and they, they have a community recycling center, uh, where rather than, than
having monetary incentives for the, the people that actually bring stuff into
recycling, they are just doing it to help out the city and then the city can
use that money, you know any money that they get from goods recycled [static].

A.7:  Well I think if they had some place up, up in your area, like I know they
don't here.

B.8:  Yeah.  No, I would, I would be glad to, but you know we have no place
convenient at all.  I mean, I am not really concerned about making money off
it.  Uh --

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- you know, I mean that that the amount of money that would come out of it
is not really enough to make it worthwhile.

A.11:  That's right.

B.12:  It's just recycling per se.  Uh, we do very little.  We recycle newspapers,
[laughter] but other than that --

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  -- it's kind of a shame [static].

A.15:  We, we do our cans and stuff but, uh, uh, you know, [sigh] I don't know if
there is someplace close by where you could take everything.  I know in our
neighborhood every so often, every few months, they will put in our
subdivision, they will put out, uh, like dump trucks so you can get rid of your
trash and garbage in your yard --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and they will haul it off for you and it is all free.

B.18:  Uh-huh.

A.19:  If they do something like that and they, they will get a chipper, you know,
like in the spring and in the fall --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- if they did the same thing for recycling, I think that would go over
real well.

B.22:  Yeah.  I think, you know, I think that they would have sort of neighborhood
or semi neighborhood recycling centers.  That is what I saw in Berkeley.  It
was really nice.  It just had, uh, bunches of bins and, and, uh, in dif-, in
each particular thing --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- they even had a pacific, of course, being in wine country, they, they
even had wine bottle recycling.  So you take the wine bottles and the --

A.25:  Wow.

B.26:  -- wineries would actually buy, you know, take those bottles back
#directly.#

A.27:  #And recycle# them.

B.28:  Yeah.  And not, not to have to melt them down.  They just re-, use them.
Uh, but they had things for different types of paper, and they had things for
the aluminum and then for plastic.

A.29:  Were they all over the community?

B.30:  Apparently, yeah.  There there, you know, there is only a matter of maybe
ten, fifteen blocks away from where this friend of my lived and --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- they just gave everything up and took a trip over there and they, they
didn't get anything for it, --

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  -- but, but, uh, you know, the thing is that a center like that I am sure
it would be self supporting.  If, uh, you know, just off the proceeds of the
recycled things.

A.35:  Well, it couldn't like glass companies buy the glass back from, uh, the
city or something like that?

B.36:  Yeah, that is what I am saying.  You know, they could pay for it, you know
if they have to have someone there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on
things or do stuff, you know, that, that salary could easily be paid out of the
money that comes from uh, selling glass or aluminum or whatever.

A.37:  Right.

B.38:  And, uh, you know they even had, uh, they even had a little, little shelf
area for recycled books.  Where people brought books they didn't want.

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  Put them on the shelf and take come take anything you wanted off the shelf.

A.41:  Well, I'll be.

B.42:  It was quite quite an operation.

A.43:  Well that is pretty neat.  Maybe it will catch on all over.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  But, I haven't really seen it around here.

B.46:  No.

A.47:  Or none at all.  Uh, I have seen where, uh, I think trash company {some
static} will put out, you put out a bin, but it it was never explained what
you put in it.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  You know, and do they really, I haven't seen a special kind of a truck, oh
in this area.  Now, I have seen them, uh, around Austin.

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  Uh, some, that they're like three division trucks and, you know --

B.52:  Oh.

A.53:  -- it has three compartments.

B.54:  Oh.  I haven't seen those.  Now I, I think I have seen them actually going
with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans.  People
put them on separately.

A.55:  Huh.

B.56:  And they will toss those in a bag on the side of the truck or something,
but you know.  Yeah, yeah, I think that there is a little bit of you know, of,
I think that they, the emphasis on making money from recycling --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- is, is a little bit wrong.  Certainly, there is money and value to
somebody, but I think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend
the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and
so --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- uh, you know, I think they, they ought to make more of an emphasis on,
on convenience as opposed to, uh, to, uh, you know, trying to give people money
for it.

A.61:  Yeah, I know.  I know if they did something like that at work, if they
separated paper.  Where I work they don't even separate the paper.

B.62:  No.  Now that we do.  Where I work, we, we recycle the cans and bottles and
--

A.63:  Yeah.

B.64:  -- but there is a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know,
generally clean white paper --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- and, uh,

A.67:  Now see they don't even do it where, I work for a private laboratory and
you know, that, uh, ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- and they they shred all of it --

B.70:  Oh.

A.71:  -- I would think, you know, and I have seen them carry them out,
