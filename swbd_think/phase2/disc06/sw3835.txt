A.1:  Well, how you doing?

B.2:  I'm fine.  I want to know where you're from.

A.3:  [Throat_clearing] I, from, um, Plano, #Texas.#

B.4:  #Oh, are you?#

A.5:  Where, how about you?

B.6:  I, I am too.

A.7:  Oh, okay [laughter].

B.8:  Are you at the Christ United?

A.9:  Pardon?

B.10:  Are you in Christ United Methodist?

A.11:  No, um, I, I work for T I.

B.12:  Oh, okay [laughter].

A.13:  [Laughter] So that's how, 

B.14:  Well, okay, well, um, anyway, um, I'm with a, a choir, and, and we've been
doing this as a fund raiser.  I wasn't sure if they were still doing it or
not, but I know that's not what we're supposed to talk about [laughter].

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  Okay, I'm having dinner right now, and, and, on the subject of food, so
just continue and you tell me something you'd like --

A.17:  Well, are you --

B.18:  -- to tell me about food.

@A.19:  -- are you having a Super Bowl party?

B.20:  Uh, no, I'm not, actually.  I wish I were.  

A.21:  Well, I's thinking, now that would be a [TV] good place to exchange a
recipe maybe [laughter].

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Um, we're not having [TV] one this year either but, um, I'm going to one,
and this year it's pretty simple.  All I have to take is cheese [laughter].

B.24:  Oh, that's going to be easy.

A.25:  [Laughter] I know, I don't even have to make anything.

B.26:  Oh.  

A.27:  #But,# 

B.28:  #Well,# I guess my, my favorite recipe that I've seen this week was fried
green tomatoes.  Did you see that in the paper?

A.29:  No, I didn't.  Uh, uh, it's probably in reference to the movie, #I'm sure.#

B.30:  #Right,# right.

A.31:  Um, I know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded
really good.  Are they, I don't even, I've never had fried tomatoes.

B.32:  Well, you know, I don't guess I have.  I mean, I'm from Mississippi
originally, and surely, you know, I don't even know that I've ever seen it
offered, to tell you the truth, and, but, thi-, this [laughter] evidently is a
Southern delicacy that --

A.33:  Huh.

B.34:  -- I didn't know about.

A.35:  I didn't know about it either.  Now we, I have had, um, [throat_clearing]
marinated green tomatoes, you know --

B.36:  Uh-huh --

A.37:  -- where you marinate them with onions --

B.38:  -- uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and #cucumbers.#

B.40:  #Right.#

A.41:  But, that, I've never had fried, fried green ones.

B.42:  Well, I tell you, if you see that movie it'll make you want them.

A.43:  Oh, really?  [Laughter].

B.44:  It just, they just really make it look good.  Now I love things like fried
okra --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- and I try not to ever have fried things, but still, you know, if I,
[laughter] I think, uh, that the fried green tomatoes would be something like
that.

A.47:  Are they pretty, does it look like it's a pretty easy thing to make?

B.48:  Probably.  You probably bread them and, and, uh, you know, like with corn
meal and --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- that kind of thing and then, [inhaling] #fry them in grease.#

A.51:  #Now, I did, I did# go to a dinner this past weekend that was, um, at our
church.  We had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were
auctioned off were, um, services, like a dinner for eight.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  And then if you bought, if you bought it, there were two couples that, two
or three couples that might cater the dinner.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  [TV] And one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines, um, years,
oh, eight years ago, and so they, um, auctioned off a Filipino dinner --

B.56:  Ooh --

A.57:  -- and, um --

B.58:  -- #how nice.#

A.59:  -- #so it was# really fun.  One of the things that we had were, was fried,
um, bananas, but, not fried bananas, I don't know what they're called, but
it's a, it's kind of looks like the dough that they use for egg rolls --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- I don't know what it's called, but, they put bananas in there and, with
cinnamon and, I don't know what else, and sugar and stuff, and then they deep
fry it, and they use green bananas, you know, so that --

B.62:  Oh.

A.63:  -- the bananas kind of stay together [throat_clearing].  And I have fixed
fried bananas before, as a, um, Cuban or Spanish dish --

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  -- you know, and they're really, really good.  But, um, when you were
talking about fried tomatoes, it [laughter] reminded me of this, the fried
bananas, that, you know.

B.66:  Oh, I bet that was good, I know I would like that.

@@A.67:  Yeah, it was really a fun, a fun thing to do, a fun way to raise money.

B.68:  Do you work, um, in any particular, what, what area do you work in?

A.69:  I'm up at Spring Creek.

B.70:  At Spring Creek, in what --

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- what area?

A.73:  Um, manufacturing.

B.74:  Manufacturing, because, my husband is, works for T I also.

A.75:  Oh, really?

B.76:  Uh-huh.  He's at, he's at Spring Creek, but he's manager of, {speaking to
someone in the room} what are you manager of, [laughter] honey, {back to the
phone} telecommunications.

A.77:  Okay, okay, so he's in a different group.

B.78:  Uh-huh.  Always it, it's so funny his job is so complicated that I, to me
it's complicated that I never can exactly describe it to anybody.

A.79:  Yeah, yeah, I never can either.  I, I mean, I never can describe mine to my
family --

B.80:  Uh-huh --

A.81:  -- or anything.  

B.82:  -- uh-huh.

A.83:  Try to, I try to talk real, real basic level --

B.84:  Uh-huh.

A.85:  -- when I get down to them.

B.86:  Well, um, now back to FRIED GREEN TOMATOES,

A.87:  [Cough].

B.88:  you, be sure and see that movie.

A.89:  Okay.

B.90:  We saw it last Saturday, and it was wonderful.

A.91:  Was it?

B.92:  Oh, it really was.

A.93:  Is it a girl movie?

B.94:  Uh-huh, well --

A.95:  I mean, is it --

B.96:  -- it's either one.

A.97:  -- is it something my husband would enjoy?

B.98:  Yeah, uh-huh.  It, it has, it's a story that would appeal to both men and
women --

A.99:  #Because he doesn't like going to see girly [laughter],#

B.100:  -- #uh, Dave liked it a lot.  Huh?#

A.101:  [Laughter]  Like, like STEEL MAGNOLIAS, he didn't like that.

B.102:  Oh, no, now, but my husband liked STEEL MAGNOLIAS, but it was more like,
this is more like (( )) {name of movie}.

A.103:  Yeah, yeah.

B.104:  Did you see that?  

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  And, um, and this probably is even a little more masculine than, than (( ))
even.

A.107:  Okay.

B.108:  But it's that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal.

A.109:  Yeah, I mean like I have to rent BEACHES and, you know, some of those other
#movies.#

B.110:  #Uh-huh.#
