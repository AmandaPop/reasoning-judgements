A.1:  How do you get your news coverage?  

@B.2:  Well, um, most of what I do is, um, listen to the news in the morning when
I'm heading to work.  Um, [lipsmack] we get, uh, we have two different
stations here that run, uh, National Public Radio,

A.3:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.4:  #and# I really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when I'm
driving home from work.  So that's where I get most of my stuff.

A.5:  #Well that's,# 

B.6:  #Uh,# 

A.7:  pretty nice.  

B.8:  Yeah, we, we also subscribe to the newspaper of course, so we get,

A.9:  #Yeah.# 

B.10:  #the WASHINGTON# POST here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper.

A.11:  Right.  

B.12:  And, uh, so it's, you know, it's, it's, uh, between the two I generally do
okay.  Every great once in a while I manage to, uh, listen to the evening news
but not very often.  #How abo-,# 

A.13:  #Yeah,# that's just about all I get is the evening news and the, and the
newspaper, and sometimes I wish the evening news was like an hour long instead
of thirty minutes.

B.14:  Yeah, I don't blame you.  It's, it's, #uh, it's,# 

A.15:  #But# that would be nice to have, uh, um, you know, al-, is it an all news,
uh, radio station?

B.16:  Yeah, and it actually, well, no, I, it's, I guess, what is it?  It's, um,
it's kind of a talk radio station.  It's run by a university here called
American University,

A.17:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.18:  #or at least# that the, the general program that I listen to.  National
Public Radio itself is, um, [lipsmack] a, uh, uh, a syndicated thing that's
run by a group that operates here in Washington.

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  Uh, but if you have any public radio stations in your area, chances are
pretty good, especially in Austin come to think of it, uh, that you're going
to be able to get it down there.  #Uh,# 

A.21:  #I,# I guess I never, I never really tried that.  

B.22:  {Very faint}  #You know.#

A.23:  #It# probably is on the A M.  I know it's not on F M.  

B.24:  Well, I don't know.  Whatever your, you know, it d-, da-, normally the
public radio stations are going to be down at the low end of the dial and,

A.25:  #Yeah.# 

B.26:  #you know,# around eighty-eight and, uh, and so forth and, and, uh, this,
uh, the two radio stations that run here, one is a classical station and the
other, I guess if you had to categorize it, it's kind of a bluegrass station
or something.

A.27:  Yeah.  

B.28:  Um, but, uh, yeah, that, that's, I'm, I'm dead certain some station in your
area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special
features on Austin.  It's a real interesting radio program because they, #they
don't just pu-,#

A.29:  #Well, it's probably# picking up, um, K L B J.  That's a real famous,

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  Um, um, Lady Bird used to own that little radio station here. 

B.32:  Uh-huh.  

A.33:  But, um, they're not so much news as they are, um, uh, ((first)) musicians
and --

B.34:  Uh-huh.  

A.35:  -- and things going on around Austin.  

B.36:  Huh.  

A.37:  You know.  

B.38:  Well that's very interesting.  Well this comes on right in the evening as
I'm driving home.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  And, um, what they do is they, they give you, uh, [lipsmack] about a five
to ten minute news, uh, broadcast and then,

A.41:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.42:  #for the# rest of the half-hour they usually divide it up into two or three
segments where they, they cover, um, topics either of current interests, or
every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on, on
some, uh, particular,

A.43:  #Some subject, yeah.#

B.44:  #thing like# yeah, like perh-, for instance how a particular city is doing
or something,

A.45:  #Well not bad.# 

B.46:  #along those lines.#  Yeah.  

A.47:  #That sounds,#

B.48:  #It's, uh,# 

A.49:  pretty interesting.  

B.50:  Yeah, it's real good and it, it, it, uh, the other thing is, is, i-, my
politics are kind of liberal and, and, uh, so they have a tendency being
public radio to sort of take a look at things from the populus point of view,

A.51:  #Right.# 

B.52:  #as opposed# to being terribly sympathetic to the government.  Although the
yo-, you've got to give them credit.  They do a great job of showing both
sides of the story, and, uh, they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves
either.

A.53:  [Laughter].

B.54:  Uh, which is something [laughter] I really admire.  So if you watch the
evening news, which of the news commentators do you tend to like the most?

A.55:  Oh, I guess Dan Rather.  I'll switch around.  I'm not really partial, you
know.  One, like Monday I might have one and Tuesday I might have another one,
you know, just to get a different view, you know, or just someone different
[laughter].

B.56:  Yeah, yeah.  

A.57:  But, #um,# 

B.58:  #I'm# the same way.  But the, the evening news on T V, it's, it's really,
it's so short that you just, uh, I don't feel like you wind up getting enough
and yet have you ever watched the, uh, McNeil Lehrer report on public T V?

A.59:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

B.60:  I sort of feel like that news program drags on too long.

A.61:  Yeah.  Yeah.

B.62:  And, uh, w-,

A.63:  It's a little #draggy.#

B.64:  #you know# with their little round table discussions and all that sort of
stuff, and I must admit I, I used to try to watch it and it used to make me
feel like, oh, well, this is, uh, something I should be watching.  [laughter]
#You know.#

A.65:  #Yeah.# [laughter] It really gets a little boring though.  I know there is
something better on [laughter].

B.66:  Yeah.  Exactly.  I m-,

A.67:  So it, it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's, it's, it's only,
you only have one newspaper.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  And, um, it's, it's kind of biased, but, um, i-, it's,

B.70:  #Which way?#

A.71:  #all right.#

B.72:  Which, which way does it lean?  Is it conservative or,

A.73:  Yeah.  It's very conservative.  

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  I would say it's very conservative, but you know being it's only, y-, you
don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  And you know I don't, I don't like that but oth-, I have, uh, uh, small
newspaper community, um, that's, oh, i-, it's, um, uh, just in this general
area it serves maybe twenty thousand people.

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  And, uh, it's free and it's real nice.

B.80:  Oh, wow.

A.81:  You know, I really like it.

B.82:  That's good.  Yeah.

A.83:  You know i-, it's like the small hometown newspaper.  You know, you can put
your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or, or something like that,
you know.

B.84:  Well that's inter-,

A.85:  Or some-,
