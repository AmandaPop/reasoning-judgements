========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what have been some, well, I'll start out with some of my, my
vacations.

@B.2:  Okay.  

A.3:  Uh, uh, when I graduated from high school, uh, my, uh, band, my jazz band
and we visited Europe, I visited Germany and Austria, uh, Italy, uh,
Switzerland and that was pretty fun.  I also have visited South America and
just this last summer, one of my favorite vacations is, I went to China.

B.4:  Oh, boy, you're a world traveler here.  

A.5:  So, uh, I, I, we, my wife and I, when we went to China, we visited the
Great Wall and, uh, the Forbidden City.  Uh, [lipsmack] the Forbidden City is,
uh, [lipsmack] right there, Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so
that's where all the killings occurred not too --

B.6:  Um.  

A.7:  -- couple years ago and, uh, also the Forbidden City, if you saw, what was
that one movie that was really famous,

B.8:  Oh, yeah.  

A.9:  Uh,

B.10:  Emperor.  

A.11:  THE LAST EMPEROR, yeah -- 

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  -- that was filmed in the Forbidden City -- 

B.14:  Yeah, that was a,

A.15:  -- so we had to see that when we went.  Anyway,

B.16:  Well, my wife and I are right now saving for a trip to, to England
[breathing].

A.17:  Oh, that's sounds fun.  

B.18:  We would like to stay about a month, uh,

A.19:  You'll need to save for that unless you have some friends there you're
going to stay with because,

B.20:  Well, we do have friends that we can stay at their place for a while, or as
long as we want actually, but, it's, you know, it's in the southern part, so,
but we want us to go all over the countryside.  That's our next big vacation
we've got planned.  And just a few days in the, London itself is all we're
interested in there.  But mostly to this date, uh, our vacations have been
more like, uh, anywhere where there's not too many tourists.

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  I hate resorts [breathing] and things like that.  I like to go where you
can get out by yourself in the mountains.  Done a lot of camping in New Mexico
and, uh, Colorado.

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  And one time we even toured Iowa.  My wife is from Iowa, but actually, the
southern part and, uh, she'd never really seen a lot of the different northern
places and just the lot of the little towns and so we drove around, went to
the Humana Colonies, things like that.

A.25:  Uh-huh, yeah, they're not too far from here.  

B.26:  We really, I think she enjoyed it a, a lot, because she knew more of the
history than, course, than I did of Iowa, but it was, uh, it was interesting.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  Here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas.  It's hard to get out of
Texas on a driving trip.

A.29:  Yeah, got to go a long ways.  Uh, yeah, we also don't like to particularly
go to tourist spots.  Fact, we usually choose to go places where we, at least
for part of our trip, will be visiting someone.  And, uh, even when my wife
is, well, and my ((grad trip organizing)), we knew some people who were in
Beijing and so, uh, we were able to stay with them for part of the time.  In
fact, they spoke English very well and, and helped us around to see some of
the places and even when we went to South America, uh, uh, we kn-, there were
people, contacts we had there --

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  -- so, uh, but most people that I, that I, uh, met, you know, at the
university and so, uh, it makes a big difference to us.  We like to go for, go
on a trip with someone who's from the area because, I don't know, I've, I'm
afraid, especially if I don't know the language.

B.32:  Right, we, h-, had a, we went to Mexico City once by ourselves, uh, mainly
because it was just something we could afford to do and we heard it was
interesting.  Well, we just had a real awful time because we didn't speak
Spanish.  I don't think that would have helped us any, anyway.  It was just a
miserable vacation and we decided, you know, we'll never go anywhere where
they don't speak English or [laughter] somebody that can't help us.

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  It was, by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us --

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  -- and that sort of thing.  

A.37:  Yeah.  

B.38:  And we weren't having the fun, we thought we would.  

A.39:  It really makes a difference, because I know, even when we went to China,
when we crossed the border, we went over to Hong Kong, we were so relieved.
It was so fun to be, uh, you know, it seemed like, returning to civilization
and --

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  -- where a lot of people spoke English and, uh, [inhaling] just the general
living conditions were, were somewhat higher also, so --

B.42:  Yeah.  

A.43:  -- it was, uh,

B.44:  Our last [breathing] major vacation was, uh, well we had to go to Iowa to
see some relatives because of sickness in the family, so we took that in for a
few days and then we went to a, uh, [lipsmack] to a Shaker settlement in
Kentucky and, uh, it's a, it's been rebuilt and we stayed there for three
days, and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things, and
we were able to take our dog with us, and he stayed with us and it was just
the thrill of our life to, it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that
time of the year anyway.
