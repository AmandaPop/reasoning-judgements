=============================================================================

A.1:  And how has your weather been?

@B.2:  Well my weather right now it is rainy.  This is the most rain I think we
have ever seen, uh, over a twelve month period of time since I moved to, uh, to
the Texas area.  Uh, I was, uh, I have seen climates, uh, both rather arid and,
and complete and total, uh, tropical.  So I have seen kind of the gamut, but
this is starting to lean towards the, uh, tropical end.  How about you?

A.3:  Well, this is getting to be, uh, similar to the reason I moved away from
Saint Louis.  Always of these gray gloomy rainy days.  You know?

B.4:  Oh my.  Uh-huh.

A.5:  But, uh, I have been here about, uh, well it's going on five years now and
this is definitely the rainiest January --

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  -- February.

B.8:  Oh this is, this is, uh, a neat year.  You missed the nineteen eight, eight
one, uh, uh, mess.  The nineteen eighty summer that about roasted everybody and
then the eight one spring that, uh, where practically every lake in, uh, north,
north Texas overflowed.

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter] Really?

A.11:  Well, I thought it was bad enough about four years ago when we had the, was
it, uh, three or four years ago when we had the big ice storm?

B.12:  Oh, yes ma'am.  Well that was, that's pretty good.  However, the one in
seventy nine and, uh, and, uh, seventy eight and seventy nine --

A.13:  Yes.

B.14:  -- uh, dwarfed that one.

A.15:  You have been here a while then. 

B.16:  Yes ma'am.  Since, uh, you know I have been, well the firm I am with, uh, I
have been with them, them for twenty three years, so and they are in the north
Texas area.

A.17:  Oh, okay.

B.18:  So [laughter]. Yeah, I have seen quite a bit of, of weather, uh, patterns.
Of course like I say, uh, when I was in the service I got to see plenty of,
uh, different, uh, locals as far as wet and dry, uh, climates and, uh, uh, I
was kind of like you.  I'm I didn't want to go back to Colorado because,

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  because of the tremendous weather we had.

A.21:  Gosh.  I think you are the first person from Colorado I have heard that
didn't say, oh it's wonderful.  It's so dry here [laughter].

B.22:  Uh, no, no, no [laughter].

A.23:  Well this actually isn't far enough south for me.

B.24:  Oh, okay.

A.25:  I would like to get down to, oh, Tampa.  Some place like that where,

B.26:  Tampa, Florida?

A.27:  At least.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  Yes.

B.30:  Well let's see.  My in-laws, uh, winter in the Leesburg area.

A.31:  Is that down the coast of Florida?

B.32:  Well, it's, uh, in the Orlando area.

A.33:  Okay.

B.34:  And Tampa, Saint Petersburg is not that super far away.

A.35:  No.  I think it's a couple hours drive #if I,#  

B.36:  #Yeah# something like that.  I think we made to from their house to, uh,
Bush Gardens in ninety minutes that day.

A.37:  Uh-huh, you may have been speeding a little bit though.

B.38:  Well, no, no, no, no,

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  no not, not at that, not down that, uh, uh, tollway they've got.

A.41:  I see.

B.42:  There's, there's smokies.  You think our smokies are bad with, uh, uh, our
uh, little Mustangs that are hot rods.  They got them there too.

A.43:  Is that right?

B.44:  Oh, yeah.

A.45:  [Laughter].

B.46:  I know.  We, uh, we were, uh, over run by one in, uh [laughter].  We went
down for Christmas and we were cruising along in our little rental car and,
uh, this, this car comes over the hill and [noise] {sounds like a whistle}
pass me and it was one of those puppies and he was flat moving.

A.47:  Do they arrest people there?

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  Uh.

B.50:  Yeah, he's --

A.51:  Unlike Dallas [laughter].

B.52:  -- he pulled [laughter] he pulled one over and was, uh, stead having a
little chat about something, other than the weather,

A.53:  [Laughter].

B.54:  that's for sure.  Because I mean, he didn't look happy when we went by.

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  So, I don't know.  Maybe it was, uh, who knows.  But anyway this weather
here is, is certain evolved from a dryer hotter, uh, nineteen eighty to, uh,
the present.  The last summer we had.  I think we barely what cleared a
hundred.

A.57:  Maybe.

B.58:  I think that was stretching it.

A.59:  Well, I'll, I will tell you.  I will definitely take the hot summers.

B.60:  Oh, well believe you me.  I, I'm not, not,

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  advocating cold summers, no, no, no, no, no, no,

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  wrong, wrong, wrong but, uh, uh, the summer of nineteen eighty, we saw one
hundred fifteen --

A.65:  No kidding.

B.66:  -- and one hundred sixteen and I was running a little heating and
air-conditioning business at the time.

A.67:  I bet you just did all kinds of business.

B.68:  Well, uh, what happened there was that most of our, everybody's customers,
uh, down here about April start to call, call call every-, you know call their
local guys --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and we go out and tune up the systems.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  And we are normally expecting some hundred, hundred degree days --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- so we tune for that.  So we had everybody nice in tune when the hundred
and fifteen degree weather hit.

A.75:  Yes.

B.76:  And so, the only thing that got replaced were the weak systems.  You know,
that would barely make it at one hundred, but when the hundred and fifteen
degree days hit, well it just couldn't couldn't handle the load and they, then
they then the compressors blew like popcorn.

A.77:  Oh, I will bet.

B.78:  I mean just pop, pop, bang, bang [noise].

A.79:  [Laughter].
