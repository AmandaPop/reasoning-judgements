========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, Ashley, uh, do you exercise regularly?  

@B.2:  Yes, I do.  I, uh, go on long walks whenever I can and, uh, well, when I,
when I can fit it into my schedule and the weather's right I like to walk, uh,
oh, three, four miles a day.

A.3:  Uh-huh, well that's, [thumping] pretty good.  I, unfortunately, uh, am not,
uh, exercising regularly at the time.  Uh, I, we recently made a move.  I used
to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and I
regularly played, uh, racquetball.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  But, uh, since we've moved [inhaling] to Iowa now, uh, we don't have as
many facilities like that, uh,

B.6:  Well, that sort of, same sort of thing happened to me.  I used to be a
regular swimmer.  I, I taught at a university and I, you know, could use the
pool every day if I wanted, and since moving away from the university
environment, I've, uh, now it's kind of difficult to find a pool that's
convenient and affordable to swim in.  But, uh, what university were you at?

A.7:  I was at Brigham Young University.  

B.8:  Uh-huh.  

A.9:  Uh, actually, I am working at a university right now.  I just graduated
with my P H D at Brigham Young and I'm working at the University of Iowa.
However, we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at
Brigham Young, but, uh, it's, we, the benefits here, as far as, uh, using the
physical facilities are not free here, so, and plus they're not as convenient.
We're, we're further away, so it's not as convenient for like my wife to come
in, you know, for doing things together.

B.10:  Did you say you're at the University of Iowa?  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  Iowa City, huh.   

A.13:  Right.  

B.14:  #I, I# --

A.15:  #Uh-huh.#

B.16:  -- I visited there once quite a few years ago.  Had a friend who was in the
Linguistics Department there.

A.17:  Oh. I'm in the, at the National Center for Voice and Speech, which is part
of the, uh, Department of Speech Pathology.

B.18:  Uh-huh.  

A.19:  Uh,

B.20:  Well you,   

A.21:  Well, uh,   

B.22:  Do you have contact with any of the, uh, people in Linguistics?

A.23:  I t-, I haven't been here, uh, uh, only for several months and --

B.24:  Yeah.

A.25:  -- uh, I, I'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the
departments, but, uh, I'm not aware of anything as yet.

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  Uh, I,

B.28:  Well, if you ever run into, uh, to Cathy ((Reagan)), say hi to her for me
[laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter] Okay.  

B.30:  I think she's still there.  

A.31:  Okay, usually, when the temperatures are warmer, uh, I live about twenty
minutes from school, so, uh, from the University, so I often will walk and,
which, I guess, it's, I'm not sure how far it is.  Uh, actually it's
twenty-five minutes and it's probably about a m-, I don't know how much that
would be.

B.32:  Well --

A.33:  Maybe a,

B.34:  -- how briskly do you walk, do you think?  

A.35:  What?  

B.36:  How, how fast do you walk, do you think?  

A.37:  Oh, I walk rather briskly, but I don't, I don't do it during these winter
months, it's --

B.38:  Uh-huh.  

A.39:  -- just far too cold.  Uh,

B.40:  Well, a brisk walker can go maybe, what, four or five miles an hour, so if
it takes you a third an hour to get in, you're probably going, oh, I would say
at least a mile and a half, probably.

A.41:  Yeah, so, anyway, I could get a little bit of exercise that way.  Uh,

B.42:  Yeah, the winter, of course, even here in, uh, in northern Texas, we do get
a little cold weather, but most of the winter I can go walking just about
anytime I want to.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  This winter, though, it's rained so much, that, uh, there have been times
where, see, my, uh, favorite, uh, area to walk is a, a greenbelt they have
right through Plano here, and, uh, you know, it's, it surrounds a little
stream over m-, much of its extent.  You can walk for miles there and never
cross a street.  You, you go under the streets, you know.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  But, uh, when the, uh, when the water is too high, uh, you'd get washed
away.  They have signs up there warning people to stay away so,

A.47:  Oh [laughter].  

B.48:  We've had that, uh, a number of times recently.  Not to mention the mud, of
course.

A.49:  Oh, yeah.  

B.50:  [Inhaling] Well -- 

A.51:  But,

B.52:  -- you can get, you can do the other thing I do is, uh, I have a little
exercise bike that, uh, wasn't too expensive.  I got a cheap one, but you can
really work up a sweat on it.

A.53:  Yeah, if I were to be, to begin exercise now, I think it would be something
that I could do, uh, [lipsmack] indoors, something that's convenient, uh, you
know, like an exercise bike or something like that.  Although I haven't
purchased one, purchased one yet.

B.54:  Yeah {very faint}.

A.55:  Sometimes I, I have this little [lipsmack] tramp-, small type trampoline
that I do indoor jogging on, sometimes for exercise, but I haven't really
start-, been doing anything regular,

B.56:  [Throat_clearing].

A.57:  for the last several months since we, since we moved to, to Iowa.

B.58:  Yeah, I, I really prefer outdoor exercise.  I'm afraid that my favorite
indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesn't help very much.

A.59:  [Laughter]. 

B.60:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.61:  Well, outdoor exercise is, uh, more convenient, howev-,
