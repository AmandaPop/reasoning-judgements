============================================================================

B.1:  Well, do you go camping, Glen?

@A.2:  Yes.  Uh, we live, uh, right to the base of the (( )) front so, uh, uh, as
our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the
mountains and different, taking our children with us or deer hunting or
whatever.

B.3:  By camping you, you mean really roughing it?  

A.4:  Well, uh, sometimes we did.  Most of the time we'd, we'd put up tents, and
we'd go up and stay for a week or, uh, weekend or go up into, uh, Yellowstone
Park and, and camp in the campgrounds up there.

B.5:  Oh.  I bet that #was,# 

A.6:  #But# we really had some enjoyable times as a family and, uh, some real
good memories.  How about your experiences on camping, uh, [noise] what have
you,

B.7:  Uh, well, I've, our children were growing up also.  Uh, we had a boat and
we'd go camping on the long weekends, uh, Memorial Day,

A.8:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.9:  #Fourth of# July, Labor Day.  

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  And, uh, we went with some good friends and we'd get as many, you know,
involved as we could and so our kids really grew up all through, uh, you might
say junior high and high school camping.

A.12:  Uh-huh.  

B.13:  And, uh -- 

A.14:  Well that sounds,

B.15:  -- we've really r-, had a good time doing it.  Uh, we went to a lake called
Lake ((Tawakoni)).  Uh, it's just kind of east and south of here in Texas.

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  And, uh, we camped outside.  One time we had a tornado come through our --

A.18:  Oh, wow.    

B.19:  -- campgrounds.  It was kind of interesting.  We had snakes and --

A.20:  Uh-huh.  

B.21:  -- armadillos and,

A.22:  All those fun things, huh?  

B.23:  All the fun things, 

A.24:  [Laughter]. 

B.25:  that, that make memories.  

A.26:  Yes.  I'll say.  Well, we, uh, when we were up in, uh, by Yellowstone Park
we had a moose that went through our campground and we had a, a bear,

B.27:  #A bear?# 

A.28:  #once that went through.#  Uh-huh.  

B.29:  Oh.  

A.30:  Black bear, 

B.31:  #Oh.# 

A.32:  #and then we,# uh, we've seen a lot of rattle snakes -- 

B.33:  Oh. 

A.34:  -- uh, in our camping trips.  ((And)) all of those creatures of the wild
and like you say, those really make memories,

B.35:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.36:  #of things the# kids never forget, but I think the one that really excited
the kids, our kids were quite young and that's when this moose, great big
antlers, come walking right through our campground.  We had a fire going and,
and, uh, it just kind of sauntered through,

B.37:  [Laughter]. 

A.38:  and went over to a stream and was eating and [lipsmack],

B.39:  Didn't, didn't mind you being there a bit, huh?  

A.40:  No, no, no.  He, we, didn't bother it and, uh, everything was fine, but,
uh, it's, uh, camping has really, uh, been a, a great part of our life and now
we're, we're older.  All of our kids are gone and we don't, uh, uh, in fact,
last year was the first year I didn't go out camping on the deer hunt.  Now we
have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and I didn't, first time in, uh,
fifty-four years that I hadn't gone out in the mountains,

B.41:  #Oh.# 

A.42:  #for the# deer hunting so [lipsmack].

B.43:  First time, huh?  Well,

A.44:  But anyway it, uh,

B.45:  Maybe you'll get a chance to go again.  

A.46:  Yeah, when the grandkids, uh, get a little bit older then we'll, we'll,
we'll do that again.

B.47:  Take them.  Well, we kind of gave up camping about three, four years ago
to, and we built a lake house.

A.48:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.49:  And so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  Well, (( )) it's not like camping in a way but yet it is.  You're
still, uh, on the,

B.51:  We're, we're still outside, 

A.52:  #Right.# 

B.53:  #but# we, we figured we're getting a little too old to, 

A.54:  [Laughter].  

B.55:  rough it as much as we used to.  

A.56:  [Cough] Yes.  Well, we got, uh, where we had a, a camper then we got us a
fifteen foot trailer house that we, we took up and, uh, when we were going
camping so we, when we, our kids were young we did, uh, pretty well rough it.
We were in some good snowstorms and, uh, speaking about tornados up in
Yellowstone, uh, one went through there.  Usually they don't have such things,

B.57:  #I didn't,# 

A.58:  #there, but,# 

B.59:  know they did.  Yeah.  

A.60:  it took down pine trees quite a swath and, uh, we were there right after
that happened but, uh --

B.61:  Oh.  

A.62:  -- uh, those tornados I guess are, uh, pretty scary, 

B.63:  #I guess m-,# 

A.64:  #things.# 

B.65:  you know, there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't
experience them every once in a while.

A.66:  Uh-huh.  That was amazing because that was, like I say, right up in
Yellowstone and it's, uh, maybe once every hundred years or something they
have something like that but, uh, and it happened and, uh, that was,

B.67:  I bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in.  We, we went up, we pulled a
trailer out there from Illinois,

A.68:  #Uh-huh.#   

B.69:  #uh,# when, uh, probably about nineteen seventy-four.  I'm tr-, no, no, no,
no.  It was before that.  It was, must have been nineteen seventy-two before
we moved to Texas, and, uh, we had like a sixteen foot trailer,

A.70:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.71:  #that, uh, we# pulled behind the car and all the kids and the dog and,

A.72:  [Laughter]. 

B.73:  everything.  And actually I, I think I liked the camping with the tent
better than pulling with the trailer.

A.74:  Uh-huh.  

B.75:  But we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous.  

A.76:  Oh, it is.  

B.77:  #Never forget that.# 

A.78:  #It's, it's beautiful.# We spent a lot of time up there and that, but
that's a long ways to pull a trailer.

B.79:  Yeah, it was and, uh, we, needless to say we ha-, we haven't done it again
[laughter].

A.80:  [Laughter]. 

B.81:  Pulling the trailer is not the, our favorite thing to do.

A.82:  No.
