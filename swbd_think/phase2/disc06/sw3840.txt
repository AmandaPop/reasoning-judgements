A.1:  Um, Lee, what advice do you have for someone choosing a college?

@B.2:  Well, uh, as a former, uh, professor at a university and having been
through college, uh, and graduate school myself, I guess my own advice would
be to first try to assess the needs of the, the kid.  Um, some kids do very
well in large universities, and other kids do very well in junior colleges,
and other kids do very well in residential college environments.  Um, and I
think it really depends upon the individual.  The safest bet for most people
who want uh, uh, a good quality experience is a private college where they're
going to get an opportunity to have more personal contact and, uh, where
they're going to be forced by the circumstances to learn more than might be
the case in a big university.

A.3:  Uh-huh.  Did you go to a private college for your undergraduate?

B.4:  No, I went to a big university.  I went, um, I went to Pitt as an
undergraduate, and I looked at small colleges, and frankly, uh, I think I had
this sense that it would have been more difficult at small colleges, and I
think it wou-, would have been, definitely.  I mean, I, I graduated Phi Beta
Kappa, summa cum laude and went on to do a P H D, and I think that had I gone
to a small college I might have learned a lot more, but I don't think my
grades would have been nearly as good.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I think you can get away with more in a big, uh, a big university.  Uh,
what, what kind of experience have you had in this regard?

A.7:  Well, um, I went to a private university, although it was a large private
university.  It was Brigham Young University --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- in Utah, and that's, uh, has about twenty-seven thousand students.

B.10:  That's big, yeah.

A.11:  So, it's, it's pretty big, but I enjoyed my experience there.  One thing I
was thinking about this topic is, um, I would try and get a lot of input from,
from other students who had gone to the college in the particular program and
see how they liked it.  For example, I made, we-, I had a bad experience in
graduate school, and I think I would never have gone to the place had I have,
went and visited the place and talked to some of the students --

B.12:  Oh, yeah?

A.13:  -- who were currently in the program.  For example, I, um, started graduate
school, um, in, well I don't know if I should give specific names but --

B.14:  Well, that's all right.  Go ahead.

A.15:  -- it was, [laughter] um, it was just in a physics program back east and,
um, well, it happened to be in Pittsburgh, it was the University, it was
Carnegie Mills University --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- and the teaching assistantship situation just was not very good.  It
turned out that, um, there were six new teaching assistants from the U S who
went, we all quit after our first year of graduate school.

B.18:  No kidding.

A.19:  Um, it turned out that the undergraduates had thrown a big fit, the,
several years before, that they weren't learning from the foreign T A -s, and
they had six new students, fr-, foreign T A -s, also, but the foreign T A -s
could not teach the classes --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- and so there was a huge teaching burden on us, the U S T A -s.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  And so it's, we were really bogged down and,

B.24:  What I think is one of the problems with, with a kid going to a large
university generally, this happens at Stanford, Cal out here [throat_clearing]
I, I think that the, the residential college experience is generally the best
for most kids.  Some kids #are particular-,#

A.25:  #You mean the# community college #type or,#

B.26:  #Pardon me.#

A.27:  Well, by residential college, do you mean,

B.28:  Well, I mean, uh, let me, let me give you an example of a college that
would fit that description.  Um, I would say that, uh, some of the best
colleges in the country are small residential colleges, like Swarthmore
College, like, um, Amherst, Wesleyan, Williams College --

A.29:  Oh, I see.

B.30:  -- um, [throat_clearing] those are places that, that in academia are
generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations.  On the
other hand, you can go to a big university and do very well, and some big
universities, I don't know whether Brigham Young is like this, but some have a
small college feel to them.  You don't get a lot of foreign T A -s, you, I
mean in other words, that the people who teach really know how to teach --

A.31:  Oh, yeah.

B.32:  -- and I think that's what important for a lot of kids.  Uh, in my case, I
went through, uh, between sixty-eight and seventy-two in college, and it was
just this big, uh, grade game for me.  And I learned some things, and I just
luckily stumbled into the right area, um, but I was years out of graduate
school, I'd worked in industry before I ever came back and wanted to use my
training as a scientist to, uh, you know, to get anything done.  And as a
matter of fact, I'm, I'm working on a book and a theory, uh, which has
foundations ultimately in theoretical physics, and I never would have imagined
myself wanting to do something like,
