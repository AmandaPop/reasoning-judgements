======================================================================

A.1:  Now, do you have any pets?

@B.2:  Uh, yes we currently have three.  We have two cats and a
dog.

A.3:  Oh, you do?

B.4:  Wel-, [laughter] we have qu-, a big household here.

A.5:  Oh, my goodness.  Are they, uh, a specialty kind of cats,
or,

B.6:  Well they're, uh, uh, the, we have a solid black one that's
kind of long hair and, uh, but he, uh, he has a little persian in
him, but we are not, not sure how much --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- and that we inherited the neighbors, uh, persian, and when
they had to, uh, move to a place that wouldn't allow pets, so, uh,
he was like a full, full blooded persian.  Uh, and then our dog
is a big old golden retriever.

A.9:  Oh, my.  Uh-huh.

B.10:  How about you?  Do you have some?

A.11:  Well, we have, uh, a cat and a dog and, uh, a turtle.

B.12:  And a turtle.

A.13:  And a turtle.  We have the turtle, uh, but the turtle kind of
was inherited from the school where I teach.  The, uh, children
found it last year [throat_clearing] going out through the, uh,
property.  It's just a small one.  It's not one of those large
ones at all.  It's a very, very small turtle.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  And they had it in their classroom all year long almost and
were going to let it go and I didn't have the heart.  

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  It, it wasn't even my classroom.  It was the next door
#classroom.#

B.18:  #Oh, was it?#  [laughter].

A.19:  I didn't have the heart to watch them let it go so I said I
would keep it during the summer time so, uh, #we are
[laughter].#  

B.20:  #Well, we,# we were in, uh, we kind of did, did a similar
thing.  We inherited a lizard #from my# --

A.21:  #Oh, gee.#

B.22:  -- uh, my son's, uh, uh, class and, uh, it, it finally, it died
about two weeks ago --

A.23:  Oh.

B.24:  -- so my son had a, uh, had a little funeral.  He made it a
little coffin and he buried it in the yard --

A.25:  Oh.

B.26:  -- and he made him a cross [laughter].

A.27:  Uh-huh.  Oh my goodness.  Well you know, and it, it's very
hard for me to have any living, uh, creatures and, and then, uh,
sort of watch them disappear --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- it was no trouble to have this turtle.  It has, uh, a tank
and then they don't do anything and it's not large.

B.30:  Yeah. Yeah.

A.31:  And, uh, our cat, uh, is another little story.  We've had the
cat for several years now but, uh, uh, when my, my children, uh,
started school at ((Sisters)) a school up in Irving,
you might be familiar with it since you're from the general
location.  It's a boys school.  Well, anyway, uh, one of the
persons in the car pool, their cats were always having kittens
and, uh, my husband was driving the car pool one day, he was off
from work, [inhaling] and he said he would accept one of the
cats.  Now I had been avoiding this for years [laughter].

B.32:  Oh had you [laughter]?

A.33:  But he said that when the cats were weaned that we would take one of the
cats.

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  Now I don't really mind.  I don't really mind.  [inhaling] 
But I know that once you take a little living creature there that
there's another responsibility in --

B.36:  Yes.  Yeah.

A.37:  -- in the house.

B.38:  There is and, uh,  

A.39:  And, uh, so we have, uh, a, uh, what do we have, Siamese.  All
the siamese traits came out in this one particular cat.  It's not
a thoroughbred siamese --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- but it looks, if you were to see it you would say oh you
#have a siamese cat# --

B.42:  #It looks siamese, yeah.#

A.43:  -- but I know it's not a thoroughbred, but it, it, and we
have had her for many, oh gosh, I think we've had her almost
eight years now.

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  Seven years or something.

B.46:  Well, we just had a, uh, [door] uh, oh it happened about a
year ago.  We had a cat that we had for, uh, twenty years.  Uh --

A.47:  Oh, my.

B.48:  -- the year we got married,

A.49:  [Inhaling].

B.50:  we got the cat and she finally, uh, died right after, uh,
Christmas a year ago.

A.51:  Oh my.

B.52:  And that was kind of, uh, a sad parting, but she had a little
bit of siamese --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- uh, if you looked at her face you, you would picture
siamese --

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  -- although she was solid black too.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  But, uh, uh, my wife, uh, kind of missed her because she was,
uh, a cat you could hold in your lap and stuff.  The two cats we
have now don't care at all to be [laughter] --

A.59:  Oh, I see.

B.60:  -- held or anything like that.

A.61:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, our, our cat is, uh, is not the most
lap cat.  Although she will, uh, when she is, uh, in the right
mood.  Uh --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- you know let you hold her on her lap and you know, she's
not, uh, uh, a bad cat but, uh, she, she kind of is her own #cat,
in# -- 

B.64:  #Yeah.  Yeah.#

A.65:  -- in her own way.  Although, as I said she, will, uh, she will
come around you and she will let you #hold her, but she's# -- 

B.66:  #On her own terms#  [laughter].

A.67:  -- not really a lap cat.  Huh-uh.

B.68:  And what, what kind of dog do you have?

A.69:  Oh, we have a, uh, a black, uh, lab.

B.70:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, #they're friendly.#

A.71:  #And actually# it's a cross between a golden and a black so
it has longer hair.

B.72:  Oh, okay.

A.73:  And we, we've had her now for, uh, oh about, almost ten or
eleven years now.

B.74:  Is, is she a real friendly --

A.75:  Oh yeah.

B.76:  -- type dog?
