========================================================================

A.1:  Why don't you go ahead and tell me about your last home repair.

@B.2:  Well, let's see.  My last home repair I put an office in my garage.  I,
uh, took down one of my,

A.3:  [Noise].

B.4:  uh, uh, two car garage doors, and I, uh, I made an office out of it, and,
uh, [laughter] the funny thing was, uh, I s-, I didn't think I needed a
permit, you know,

A.5:  #A building permit.  Yeah.#

B.6:  #because I wasn't,# yeah, I wasn't changing the, the looks of the, of the
outside.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And my neighbor [breathing] called the, uh, city on me [laughter].

A.9:  Oh, he turned you in.  [laughter]  Huh.

B.10:  Yeah.  [laughter] He turned me in.  [laughter] And I, I was halfway done
with the office.

A.11:  Huh.

B.12:  And, uh, so,

A.13:  Did they fine you or wha-, th-, 

B.14:  Oh, well what they did was I, I called, I'm a contractor myself,

A.15:  #Okay.# 

B.16:  #and# I'm, I'm a roof contractor so, 

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  #uh, I# went down and got some permits from some, uh, roof work that we
were doing, and I, uh, I talked to them about my, you know, my garage.  And,
uh, so they said, well, you need to get a permit for this and that,

A.19:  #Uh-huh.#

B.20:  #and,# you know, electrical and all that kind of stuff so.  ((Thing is
the)) funny thing, they s-, they, uh, they wouldn't give me the permit because
they needed a, a pre-inspection.  Okay?

A.21:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  #Uh-huh.#

B.22:  #So# they came to do a pre-inspection and they, they didn't pass it because
I didn't have a permit on site [laughter].

A.23:  Oh, you're kidding.  [laughter] So how did you finally get a permit?

B.24:  Oh, we're, I'm still in my office and th-, I still don't have one and,

A.25:  You're kidding?  

B.26:  No [laughter].

A.27:  Did you finish it?  

B.28:  Huh?

A.29:  Did you finish it?  

B.30:  Uh, yeah  [laughter]. 

A.31:  And without a permit?  

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  Yeah, that, that is funny.  

B.34:  [Laughter] So it's, it's quite comical.  In fact, um, I'm starting in my,
I'm actually not starting my bathroom but I couldn't help but start in my
bathroom by, uh, taking a shower one day,

A.35:  #Uh-huh.#

B.36:  #I, I,# uh, put my hand on the, on one of the towel walls to support myself
and put my hand right through it  [laughter].

A.37:  Huh.  You've got to get a permit even to like remodel a bathroom?

B.38:  Well, um, yeah.  I think I,

A.39:  Is that right?  

B.40:  Yeah.  Here in, in Plano that's, uh, yeah.  

A.41:  #(( )) Christmas.#

B.42:  #It's pretty strange.#

A.43:  Huh.  I didn't realize they were that stringent.  I, uh, done a little bit
of remodeling on my house.  I'm, I'm an accountant but I sure enjoy, um, you
know,

B.44:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.45:  #((messing around))# and doing some things tha-, I finished a couple rooms
in the basement, and I built a real nice storage shed on a concrete
foundation, and, and, uh, I've never got a building permit.

B.46:  Is that right?  

A.47:  Yeah.  In fact, I,

B.48:  Well here, you know, even, uh, even just putting the little, uh, uh, patio
walks (( )) you have to have a permit.

A.49:  [Laughter]  Huh.  

B.50:  Yeah, it's, it's pretty strange.

A.51:  I'm thinking about building a room on my house and I, you know, I haven't
thought twice about getting a permit.

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  [Laughter]. 

B.54:  Yeah, you have a, I, I think things, you know, are, are different from city
to city,

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  #or from# state to state but,

A.57:  Well, I'm not sure.  I think I'm supposed to have one.  I just never have
gotten one.

B.58:  Oh [laughter]. 

A.59:  (( )), [laughter] maybe my neighbor will turn me in too [laughter].

B.60:  [Laughter] Well, I, I think my neighbor was a little bit, uh, putout
because he came over to, you know, he, he asked to, to help me and he's a
pretty busy guy I thought anyway,

A.61:  #Uh-huh.#

B.62:  #and I# said, well, I've, I've got my guys from work.  They're going to
come over and do most of the work, you know.

A.63:  #Uh-huh.#

B.64:  #I said# I appreciate your, your asking, but it was funny because the-,
right, that just the day after, he called.

A.65:  Is that ri-, huh.  

B.66:  Yeah, you know, I, I guess I should have let him come over and,

A.67:  #I can't# [laughter],

B.68:  #and did# my garage.

A.69:  #Uh-huh.#

B.70:  #I mean# I wouldn't have mind but I, you know,

A.71:  #Yeah.#

B.72:  #I# thought he was, he was pretty busy and, and wouldn't have time to do
it.  But, that's how things are.

A.73:  Well, that's interesting.  Well, I know you don't have any good horror
stories about home repair then because you probably, uh, don't have any
problem if you're in the profession.

B.74:  [Laughter]  No.  

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  Actually, um,

A.77:  Do you install metal roofs?  

B.78:  We do, um,

A.79:  #Or, or just the asphalt type shingle?#

B.80:  #Yeah.  Well, w-, we don't install# we, we do mostly repairs. 

A.81:  #Oh.#

B.82:  #We# do some, uh, reroofing, ((built)) up roofs and, uh, but we do repair,
uh, metal roofs.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  Yeah.  

A.85:  But, but like if you were doing a ro-, if somebody, a residential person or
house wanted you to come in and reroof their house --

B.86:  Uh-huh.  

A.87:  -- would you do that, #kind of stuff?# 

B.88:  #We do that.#  Yeah.  

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  Uh, we do work, we do mostly commercial stuff.  Uh, and we do work on a lot
of metal roofs, but we, we don't install them we just, uh, uh, repair them.

A.91:  What's your opinion about those?  I'm, my, my home is going to need to be
either reshingled or reroofed in the near future.  We don't have a lot of
heavy snow right here in Twin Falls --

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  -- but, uh, I was looking towards getting a whole aluminum, you know, or
#metal or whatever is,# 

B.94:  #Uh, I'd be# real careful.  Extreme temperature changes, uh, effect the
metal roofs.

A.95:  In, in what way?  

B.96:  It, it expands and retracts and, um, just,

A.97:   Huh.  More so than the asphalt shingles?  

B.98:   Yeah.
