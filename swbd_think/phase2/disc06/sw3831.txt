REMARKS:        Speaker A interjected a lot of "uh-huh"s and "um"s
throughout the conversation.  Speaker B was very hard to understand
because he mumbled and spoke very fast and stammered a lot.  Lots of           simultaneous speech.  JSS

======================================================================

B.1:  Okay, uh, yeah, Middle East and w-,

@A.2:  Yeah, uh, well, you know, it's really ironic because it's just about a
year ago today we were involved, you know, actively in that war that was going
on at this time.

B.3:  Yeah.

A.4:  And, uh,

B.5:  I guess last week was the, uh --

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- anniversary of everything.  

A.8:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.9:  But, uh -- 

A.10:  Uh-huh.  

B.11:  -- that's, that's one of those [laughter] messed up areas.  

A.12:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.13:  #I mean,# it's just, I, I, I think that the whole op-, you know, the idea
of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a, I don't know, I
mean --

A.14:  Um.

B.15:  -- that we're going to have peace, you can have maybe, s-, little more
stability that what they have right now but --

A.16:  Uh-huh.  

B.17:  -- it's just, that's pure hatred between the Israelis and the, uh, Arabs.
I mean, it's just, I just don't think they can coexist, I mean because they're
not ever going to, you know, it's just too many problems that,

A.18:  Yeah, well, it, it, it certainly, is not a, an easy situation to deal with,
but, uh, I, uh, I, I remember last year when the war was going on that I
actually was, uh, if one can be in any way relieved when a war is going on,
but at least Israel listened to the, uh, admonitions of the United States
about not retaliating, uh, when those missiles #were# --

B.19:  #Right.#  

A.20:  -- dropped on them and amazingly, we, we had those weapons that would
counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage.  Uh, the
whole thing was very amazing to me.  I don't think any, any of it is right, I
mean, we should be doing any of that stuff, oh, it's such an awful misuse of
what we are as people, but under the circumstances, I could not help thinking
that probably, uh, you know, five or ten years ago, I don't, I don't even
think that same kind of, uh, respect, uh, sufficiently for the United States
would have been there.  That Israel wouldn't have just gone ahead, you know,
uh, like that, uh, Arafat and the, and the, the P L O and everything would
just, you know, be so rambunctious as to, to retaliate and --

B.21:  Uh-huh.  

A.22:  -- e-, even cause worse damage.  I, oh, it was a very terrible thing but,
uh, it's, uh,

B.23:  Yeah, I'm, I'm amazed, uh, Israel didn't even, uh -- 

A.24:  Uh-huh.  

B.25:  -- #retaliate.#  

A.26:  #They did,#

B.27:  That, that, that's one of the -- 

A.28:  Yeah.  

B.29:  -- most surprising things.  

A.30:  Yeah.  

B.31:  I'm, uh, but,

A.32:  Well, I guess, you know, so long as our, uh, missile systems were holding
out to counteract what was being thrown in and things seemed to be working, I
guess it's, it's really worth trying for peace, or at least coexistence, like
you said, uh, and they have actually gone to peace talks, uh, since the time
of that war to try to hit some kind of a, a common ground for coexistence.

B.33:  Yeah, in #fact# -- 

A.34:  #So,#

B.35:  -- Baker was, uh --

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  -- a speech yesterday trying to get them back.  They're supposed to be
going back to tables pretty soon, the next week or two, I guess but, 

A.38:  Yeah, uh-huh.  

B.39:  Uh, they'll, you know, they'll work out some type of an agreement, and
something will pop up in about five years and --

A.40:  Oh, sure.  

B.41:  -- the fact that we never got, uh, Hussein out, hopefully, that will fall
apart on its own in the next year or so, but --

A.42:  Uh-huh.  

B.43:  -- I mean, if he ever gets any type of military power back, I mean, for
that area, that's just going to be same situation again and --

A.44:  Uh-huh.  

B.45:  -- I don't know, Bush -- 

A.46:  Um.  

B.47:  -- I just think, should have gone in and take him out.  That would have,
that was a major problem.

A.48:  #Yeah, well, it amazes me# -- 

B.49:  #Just him ((being)) just,#   

A.50:  -- that the guy #is still,#   

B.51:  #He's powerless but# -- 

A.52:  #Yeah.#  

B.53:  -- #still# -- 

A.54:  #Yeah.#  

B.55:  -- #the# fact that he's #still in power# -- 

A.56:  #Is around.#  

B.57:  -- #it's, over there# -- 

A.58:  #Very strange.#  

B.59:  -- that's a symbol of --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- he stood up to the evil force of the western #world and# -- 

A.62:  #Yeah.#  

B.63:  -- I mean, that's completely different mode of thinking and --

A.64:  Uh-huh.  

B.65:  -- #to them# --

A.66:  #Yeah.#

B.67:  -- what they v-, view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view
but,

A.68:  Um.  

B.69:  So I, it's, I, I don't know, the only thing that keeps us there is the oil
and, I guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying
twice as much more now for gas but,

A.70:  Oh, well -- 

B.71:  I mean,

A.72:  -- that's, hopefully not the essential issue to mankind, but, uh,

B.73:  Well, it is for the money makers out there, I guess but,

A.74:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

B.75:  I don't know, it's, it's kind of hard for me to really --  

A.76:  Yeah.  

B.77:  -- imagine.  I mean, I've never even been over in that part of the world
and, I had a friend of mine that got back and --

A.78:  Oh, really?  Yeah.  

B.79:  -- he's ((sort of there)) and he's just, said that he just really, he
couldn't stand the, the --

A.80:  #Mentality like,#  

B.81:  -- #uh, Saudis at all.#  He said they just didn't have any respect for them
at all.  Just --

A.82:  Oh, really?  

B.83:  -- they didn't, he just really had a hard time, you know.  

A.84:  Oh.

B.85:  I look at it as a, he looked at it as a job.  He wasn't like,

A.86:  Uh-huh.

B.87:  Because he didn't like the people and no one did.  He said they just
didn't, they didn't want them over there, the people they didn't like them 
and --

A.88:  Um.  

B.89:  -- you know, they had all these rules.  You couldn't bring any type of
religious artifacts in, or and --

A.90:  Oh, that's right, that's right.  

B.91:  -- any type of alcohol, anything like that.  

A.92:  Yeah.

B.93:  He's just,

A.94:  Oh, #that, that's# -- 

B.95:  #And they# -- 

A.96:  -- in Arabia.

B.97:  -- they, have like this, they look down at the so-, the American soldiers
and --

A.98:  Um.  

B.99:  -- he said it's just, you have a hard time, you know, fighting for their
cause.

A.100:  Yeah.  
 
B.101:  And to me it's, I don't know, it's just, it's just totally backward,
everything, you know --

A.102:  Yeah.  

B.103:  -- black is white and -- 

A.104:  Uh-huh.  

B.105:  -- white is black to them, I mean --  

A.106:  Yeah.  

B.107:  -- that doesn't make sense but, 

A.108:  Well, it makes you wonder h-, how,
