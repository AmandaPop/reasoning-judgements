A.1:  In dollars,

B.2:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.3:  and lives --

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  -- and the long term effects.

B.6:  Well, uh,

A.7:  [Laughter]  You ready?  I, I'll hit it if you're ready to start.

B.8:  Oh, I'm ready, #yeah.#

A.9:  #Okay.#

B.10:  Sure.

A.11:  My name's Karen, by the way.  What, what's your name?

B.12:  Karen, my name's John Benyak.  Where do you live?

A.13:  San Francisco.

B.14:  Oh, I live in Dallas --

A.15:  Oh --

B.16:  -- just outside of Dallas.

A.17:  -- nice to meet you.

B.18:  Nice talking to you [beep].  What's that mean, we're ready to go?

A.19:  Ready to go.

@B.20:  Okay, well, it, uh, the way it turned out, it wasn't worth anything,
really.  I just don't think, I've always thought that, uh, it just wasn't
carried on the way it should have been, it wasn't carried on like a war.  I
mean, if we were in there to fight a war, regardless of the reason we were
there, it should have been fought like a war.  It just, uh,

A.21:  What would that, how would that have been different, if it had been fought
like a war?

B.22:  Well, I think we'd, uh, we'd, uh, beat them.  I don't think, uh, I don't
know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the
country within and with us, but, uh, I think if we'd, uh, had allowed the
military people to conduct it like a war instead of letting the politicians
and the, and the peace (( )) and people like that dictate the terms of the way
we fought, I think things would have turned out a lot differently.

A.23:  You, you think it was a winnable war then?

B.24:  Oh, yes, yeah, I mean it was just a two bit country, always was and always
will be, and, uh, or at least it is now, and there's no way that if we'd, uh,
been able to take, uh, use the capacity that we had, the potential we had to
fight a war against a country like that, we would have, uh, what would have
lost it as a war.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  The long term effects, well, uh, I don't know, that's, that's a little
tougher to answer.  I think, uh, depends, I guess, on who's in office, but,
uh, I think Bush used that, uh, last year in the Persian Gulf, uh, by taking
some stronger, stronger measures and #when the war# --

A.27:  #You mean the effects of# --

B.28:  -- started --

A.29:  -- of Vietnam being to encourage him to, to be more defensive in his
posture and #go for,#

B.30:  -- #Be more,# or be more offensive.  Well, once the war started --

A.31:  I meant offensive, I'm sorry, uh-huh.

B.32:  -- once they decided to fight the thing, we take a, take a much, uh, run in
there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on.  I
guess what happened back in Vietnam is that, uh, they, we escalated, and, uh,
just, you know, on a gradual basis, and gave the North Vietnamese and Viet
Cong time to adjust to our, uh, increases in, uh, personnel and so forth.
They just didn't go in there, if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in
there at one time, initially, uh, I think things would have been would have
been differently, but, different, but it, they went from having the advisors,
uh, up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of
time, a long --

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  -- a long number of years, and, as I said, I think the, uh, the enemy just
gradually adjusted to that --

A.35:  Um.

B.36:  -- and, they didn't, uh, the people, the country, the people here didn't
want the war.  The way it turned out, they didn't want it.

A.37:  I do think one of the effects was that the, uh, people involved in that
kind of an, um, activity were surprised at the power that the media had on --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- um, intervening, and probably set the tone for medias involved then in
future --

B.40:  Right.

A.41:  -- whether it was a war activity or something --

B.42:  Really.

A.43:  -- along those lines that are going to involve a number of people
[laughter].

B.44:  Right.  Well, there are,

A.45:  Everything changed after that in #terms of media.#

B.46:  #Well, there were,# every, every night you'd come home from work, and, uh,
or school or whatever, and see it on the, uh, the news.  I imagine that wasn't
the case during World War Two or any of the other wars.  Uh, people just
didn't feel like they had the involvement in it, and there were --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- a lot of, lot of,

A.49:  Well, you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to
repeat the mistakes that the media, they felt the media made in --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- Vietnam war.  They weren't about to have people in there reporting.

B.52:  Right, yeah, but, uh, I just, uh, I, I guess I was in my, let's see, my
twenties during, during most of that war, and I --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- I never did think that they were [child_talking], were doing it right.
I'm just not a, uh, a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her.  I mean, that
she'd go around speaking on different campuses and getting people, uh, aroused
about the whole thing, and of course, uh, they always talked about the vocal
minority, and I guess that's what it was.  The solid majority and the vocal
minority.

A.55:  Um.

B.56:  People were listening to, to her, and I guess politicians were too.  But I
just felt, I was in the service at that time.

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  I wasn't over there, but I just felt that they fought the thing.  I mean,
they just didn't fight it like they should have.  And, it's a war, whether a
war is right or wrong, you, I mean, if you're over there, and people, or young
people, men or women are dying, they ought to fight it as a war and either win
or lose based on the fact that it's a war, and not just, uh, mealy mouth
their, their way through the thing and try to get the other side to give up on
the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth.

A.59:  That approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over
there, too, at least.

B.60:  Oh, yeah.  It would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of
casualties and so forth.  We might have lo-, I, I, I just don't think we could
have lost,

A.61:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.
