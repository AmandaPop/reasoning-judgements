A.1:  Have any great vacation spots to share with me?

B.2:  Uh, [laughter] well, 

A.3:  [Laughter]. 

B.4:  most, I'm fifty-three.  Most of my big vacations I think are probably in
the past.  I've been, you know, to Europe a couple of times,

A.5:  #Oh, boy.# 

B.6:  #and# [breathing],

A.7:  #Where in Europe?# 

B.8:  #and to# Rio.  Huh?  

A.9:  Where in Europe #did you go?#

B.10:  #Oh, okay.# England, uh, Holland, France, uh, one of the, it, most
interesting ones was Berlin.  We were there for five years and this was back
in eighty-five before, you know, the wall came [laughter] down.

A.11:  Wow.  

B.12:  So that was very interesting to go into, you know, a Communist country #and
all that.#

A.13:  #((That's not)),# 

B.14:  Of course, it's kind of laughable now, but you know that's the way it was
then.

A.15:  You say you were there for five years?  

B.16:  Five days [laughter]. 

A.17:  Oh, five days.  

B.18:  Five days.   

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  My husband's brother was the commander of the Air Force base in Berlin,

A.21:  {Very faint}  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.22:  and so we were visiting them.  

A.23:  I'm sure I interrupted you.  You was alway-, sa-, also saying that you had
gone to Rio?

B.24:  Yeah.  Uh, another brother [laughter] all my, my brothers and sisters used
to live in all these interesting places  [laughter].

A.25:  That's wonderful.  

B.26:  Uh, they're all retired and back in the states now but one lived in Rio and
that was, we went there for about ten days and that was quite a beautiful
place.

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  And, uh, so,

A.29:  So a lot of your big vacations have been --

B.30:  To,

A.31:  -- international.  

B.32:  Yeah, and to visit relatives.  My brother worked, lived in Jamaica for a
number of years so we went there,

A.33:  [Laughter]  #That's,#  

B.34:  #you know for,#

A.35:  wonderful [laughter].   

B.36:  a [laughter] week so.  A-, 

A.37:  Do you like to travel domestically as well?  Do you, do you take vacations
around the country now?

B.38:  Uh, yes.  Uh-huh.  In fact, that's probably where we'll go [laughter] in
the remaining years [laughter].

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  We'll probably just stay right here in this country.  For s-, we, I think
we could afford more back then than we can now.

A.41:  [Laughter]. 

B.42:  We're caught in this economic crunch [laughter].

A.43:  Yes.  I can relate to that.  

B.44:  We also had a time share condo, if you're familiar with,

A.45:  #Oh, yes.# 

B.46:  #those so# we use-, and it was, our home unit was in Vail, Colorado.  And
then if you didn't want to go there, you could switch and go actually
anywher-, where in the world.  #And,#

A.47:  #Did# you ski when you were there?  

B.48:  Uh, 

A.49:  In Vail?  

B.50:  Yeah, a little but we waited, we were too old when we started going to
really learn the, you know, like our children learned --

A.51:  Uh-huh.  

B.52:  -- well, and skied, 

A.53:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.54:  #well,# but, you know, that's something you really I think should learn
when you're younger [laughter].

A.55:  [Laughter]. 

B.56:  You know, you wait until you're forty-five and start [laughter] learning to
ski well then you're afraid you're going to break something.

A.57:  It's true.  It's true.  

B.58:  I've done all the talking.  You tell me what you've done.  

A.59:  [Laughter] Yours are much more exciting than mine.  Um, I think probably
finances has limited us, um, primarily.  My family, um, because I'm the
oldest, when I left, um, my family went on some really fun vacations so it's
more the things that I've done with my husband and, and more recently our
child that, uh, that we, that I could,

B.60:  #Well, you're much younger.# 

A.61:  #probably talk about.# 

B.62:  What age are you?  

A.63:  Well, I'm not actually.  I just started my family younger [laughter].

B.64:  Oh [laughter].

A.65:  I mean started my family later.  Um, I'm thirty-six and my, 

B.66:  #Well, that is young.#

A.67:  #daughter is only,# 

B.68:  Go ahead.  

A.69:  Well, but my daughter is only two so [laughter] at my age I think that my,
my mother, I mean when my mother was my age I think that I was probably twelve
or something like that.

B.70:  Yeah.  But, but that was the trend back then, you know.

A.71:  [Laughter]. 

B.72:  You had your children in the early twenties.  

A.73:  Right.  At any rate we've really enjoyed camping vacations.  I think that
that's probably the thing that we've, uh, done most each year.  Probably four
to seven times a year we'll,

B.74:  #Oh.#   

A.75:  #take short,# short little vacations maybe three days, maybe four days.
And there's so many places in the San Francisco Bay area that you can camp
that you don't really have to go very far.  You can drive as little as an hour
and get into a redwood forest,

B.76:  #Oh, and such,# 

A.77:  #and feel like you're just,# 

B.78:  beautiful country, 

A.79:  #It is,# 

B.80:  #up around you.#

A.81:  really nice to have that very close.  Um, there are some places up the
coast near ((Mendocino)) and in ((Marin)) that have what they call
environmental cabins so you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a
couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway.

B.82:  Oh.  

A.83:  So we've done that a few times too.  You know, it's very rustic.  You
don't, you bring all your own things and you bring your, your, your cooler
almost as if you were camping,

B.84:  #Right.# 

A.85:  #but there's# a stove and there's a, a table and, and, uh, platforms for
your bed mattress and that sort of thing so it's somewhat set up.  Those we've
really enjoyed.

B.86:  Oh.  

A.87:  I think what I'd like to do when our daughter is a little older and if we
have other kids is, uh, the kind of club me-, med vacations that my husband
and I enjoyed several years ago because there's,

B.88:  #Uh-huh, and# 

A.89:  #so many different activities.# 

B.90:  and like you can take children now, can't you?  

A.91:  Yes.  They call them club kids [laughter].  

B.92:  Yeah.  Okay.  I knew, I knew something about that.  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  Yes.  They have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored
for kids and baby-sitters if you have children that are, you know, in,
