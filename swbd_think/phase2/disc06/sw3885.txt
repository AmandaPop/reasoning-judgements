===========================================================================

A.1:  Declined that San Francisco has more crime than Texas  [laughter].

B.2:  Than Plano, Texas.  Yeah, I sure am [laughter]. 

A.3:  It's a, it's a difficult question.  I don't know that I, uh, can easily
come up with an answer to #what can be done.#

@B.4:  #I don't think# there is an answer of what would make crime go away.
There's no such thing.

A.5:  I think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in, 

B.6:  #Yeah, I think you're right.# 

A.7:  #our society today,# so.  

B.8:  Have you ever had your house broken into?  

A.9:  No, #no.#

B.10:  #I haven't# either.  

A.11:  [Lipsmack] It's, it's hard to know actually whether the crime, um, impact
would be better or wou-, would decrease or would increase if there were some
changes in the way drugs are legislated.  I don't know if,

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  I have, uh, an opinion yet about, uh, legalization of certain kinds of
drugs but, um, boy, there's certainly a lot connected with that, you know.

B.14:  That's for sure.  {very faint}  #That's for su-,# 

A.15:  #Organized# crime as well as [laughter],

B.16:  I've never really been a victim of a crime.  And I've never had my car
stolen or my house broken into or any of that #so,# 

A.17:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.18:  #I've always lived in,# 

A.19:  #Well, I guess,#          

B.20:  suburbs.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but,

A.21:  [Lipsmack]  Yeah, 

B.22:  [Noise]. 

A.23:  I grew up in a pretty small town, and I'm not sure that, um, [lipsmack]
the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much
to do with it because, because you're seen as an enclave.  You might get hit
by somebody from the outside anyway.

B.24:  Yeah.   

A.25:  Um, I guess on a, on a local level, uh, I, I was thinking when I heard the
question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little
easier now that I think about it if I look at what an individual could do, and
obviously, if you have lights on and you have,

B.26:  [Noise]. 

A.27:  uh, uh, a timing system for your lights in your own home, you're going to
reduce the risk of being broken into.

B.28:  Right.  There's so many things that you can do in that way and you know
going into parking lots with, with your keys out, being prepared.

A.29:  Right.  

B.30:  You know, #being on the defensive.# 

A.31:  #Right.  Looking# less like a victim.  

B.32:  Right.  

A.33:  Neighborhoods watching each other.  

B.34:  Yeah, we have a neighborhood crime watch where I am.  

A.35:  Yes.  

B.36:  Where did you grow up?  

A.37:  In a southern California suburb.  It was outside of Long Beach, kind of
near Huntington Beach.

B.38:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, well my girls and I were just, just down there this
Christmas.  They play soccer and so you were down in that same area
[laughter].

A.39:  Oh, really?  

B.40:  Yeah.  #But,#

A.41:  #Yeah.# I've lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now, and, um,
probably have learned by, uh, indirect and direct experiences about things to
do to, you know, avoid those kind of situations, but I think part of it's just
as you grow [laughter].

B.42:  #Yeah.# 

A.43:  #As you# mature you, you recognize, um, how to present yourself in a public
situation so that you don't look like you are a victim,

B.44:  #That's right.# 

A.45:  #a potential victim.# 

B.46:  Yep.   

A.47:  It's a hard thing to communicate to kids, isn't it?  

B.48:  It sure is.  Do you have children?  

A.49:  I have a two year old [laughter].

B.50:  Yeah.  They're not afraid of much at two [laughter]. 

A.51:  No, no.  But you know, as a child,

B.52:  [Throat_clearing].

A.53:  we were able to, uh, ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our
friends, and those are things that I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with when
she gets to bike riding age, #you know.#

B.54:  #Yep.# I can understand that.  You know, as we were traveling back from
that same toc-, soccer tournament I was telling you about, we stopped in Mesa,
Arizona.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  And I was just amazed at the [breathing] freedom that those kids felt.
They just don't have, I mean even here in Plano, Texas I worry when my kids
walk, you know, a block [laughter].

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  And we talked to some of our relatives there and they said, you know, we
just don't worry about that.  There aren't kidnappings and there aren't,

A.59:  #That's interesting.#

B.60:  #There isn't that element,# 

A.61:  #How large,#

B.62:  #here, yet.#

A.63:  a community is that?  

B.64:  Um, I don't really know.  I don-, it's not real big.  It's right outside of
Tucson.

A.65:  Uh-huh.  And, and Plano, what would you say is the population? 

B.66:  Uh, I don't know that either.  It's,

A.67:  Because sometimes it's hard to, you know, I, I look at small towns that
have had problems with kidnappings and I think well the-, you know, they're
not on the edge of some large metropolis.  Um, you know, it's hard to even --

B.68:  Yeah.  

A.69:  -- look at the factors that influence that happening.  Why, #why in that
particular ar-,# 

B.70:  #Why it would happen here# and not there.  

A.71:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.72:  Yep.  I guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and,
and neighborhood and hope for the best, you know, #and just,# 

A.73:  #Uh-huh.# Do you find yourself teaching your children things that, uh, you,
you know that they need to do but you didn't have perhaps in the way of,

B.74:  #Sure.#  

A.75:  #level# of awareness at an early age?

B.76:  Sure.  I-, and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be
scared all the time.  [laughter] #And to really be cautious.#

A.77:  #Uh-huh.  How, how do they# respond to that when you, 

B.78:  [Throat_clearing]. 

A.79:  tell them about kidnappings?  

B.80:  #Well, they don't know any other way.# 

A.81:  #At what age were they ready for that?# 

B.82:  They don't know any other way.  I mean they weren't raised when I was when
you didn't worry about that.  Everyone worries about that now so they just
assume that you'll always have to be on your guard.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  #How old,# 

B.84:  #And this,# 

A.85:  were, were they when you introduced that --

B.86:  #Oh, real young.# 

A.87:  -- #(( ))?# 

B.88:  I mean I can remember when my, my oldest daughter is thirteen today, and
when she was just three I took her to the Sun Valley Mall.  Do you know where
that is?

A.89:  Uh-huh.  

B.90:  [Laughter]  Yeah.  I grew up there in Concord.  

A.91:  Uh-huh.  

B.92:  Anyway and, um, she had gotten lost and it started right then.  You know
and every person I would see that had a little girl, you know, tucked under
their arm, I'd run, you know [laughter],

A.93:  #Oh, gosh, a,#  

B.94:  #to see# if that was her.  

A.95:  scary #experience.# 

B.96:  #Oh,# yeah.
