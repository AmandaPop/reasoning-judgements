========================================================================

A.1:  Well, are you in the market for a new car?  

@B.2:  Uh, well, yeah, I am as a matter of fact.  Well, act-, actually I'm
looking for another car, but, uh, uh, new, probably not.

A.3:  Oh.  What sort of requirements to you have for your car?  

B.4:  Uh, sports car.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  Uh, usually either black or red.  

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  And electric windows, and power locks [laughter].  

A.9:  I see [laughter].  

B.10:  Now,

A.11:  Top of, [laughter] top of the line.   

B.12:  Well, not so much that as it is, I've had so many times when, uh, uh, you
know, I'll have a friend next to me or I see somebody, uh, guy broken down on
the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window.

A.13:  Oh. 

B.14:  It is just a real pain, or, you know, if I'm driving along and there's
somebody next to me and, uh, somebody that I know and you try to talk to 
them --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  -- it's real difficult to drive, reach over, and try to roll down the
window.

A.17:  Right, right.  

B.18:  And, uh, so, power locks, power windows are just, just things that, uh,
just really help a lot [laughter].

A.19:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.20:  What about you?  

A.21:  Well, I guess I'm, uh, more traditional in that I don't like p-, [laughter]
power windows or power locks,

B.22:  [Laughter]. 

A.23:  because the people that I know h-, who have them always seem to have
trouble with them.

B.24:  Oh. 

A.25:  And, uh, so I don't, I just don't like anything that I can't figure out why
it doesn't work [laughter].

B.26:  Sure.  

A.27:  And then I want, you know, good, uh, gas mileage and I want an air bag and,
uh, I guess,

B.28:  Have you ever had a car with an air bag?  

A.29:  No, I haven't.  Have you?  

B.30:  No.  

A.31:  Somehow I just think, you know, I like the idea [laughter].  

B.32:  Well, it, it see-, sure seems to save lives and -- 

A.33:  Right.  

B.34:  -- uh, yeah.  I, actually, I like the anti-lock brakes.  

A.35:  Right, that's a good idea.  

B.36:  And I have never had a chance to, I have been in cars that have had them,
but I've never tromped on the brakes to see, uh, you know, on ice or water
just to see if they didn't lock up.

A.37:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.38:  But, uh, you think you'd buy, uh, an American car or a European or
Japanese?

A.39:  Well, I, actually I don't know a lot about different brands.  I tend to
have, you know, my requirements like the last time I bought a car I, I guess I
did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically, you know, good
repair record, good mileage, uh, [lipsmack] and I needed air-conditioning and,
uh, [lipsmack] can't remember what my, oh, I wanted s-, uh, stick shift.  And,
so I didn't have a whole lot of choice [laughter].  There was one car in all
of the, the metropolitan area that I could find that, you know, was sort of a
medium priced car with a [laughter] stick shift in it.

B.40:  What was that?  

A.41:  It, it turned out to be a, a Chrysler.  Uh [lipsmack], Lancer.

B.42:  Huh, stick shift, huh?   

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  Did it have, what, a three speed or a four speed?  

A.45:  No, a five speed.  And it, basically, it was something that a military guy
had ordered and hadn't picked up, and so it had been on the lot three months
and they were really eager to sell it.

B.46:  Wow.  

A.47:  So, I guess in this area, at least, you know, if it's not automatic, it
doesn't move.

B.48:  Well, actually, I much prefer a stick shift and, what, I'm, I'm curious.
I, I know why I love a stick shift.  Why d-, [laughter] why did you want one?

A.49:  Well, I just wanted it because, again, I had, I guess traditionally always
had a car that had one and I thought it would be more reliable.

B.50:  Uh-huh.  

A.51:  Uh,

B.52:  It's hard to find stick shift cars anymore.  

A.53:  [Laughter] I found that out.  

B.54:  [Laughter]. 

A.55:  [Laughter] I mean, you know, the people would just sort of look at me
like, you must be crazy when I,

B.56:  [Laughter]. 

A.57:  went in to, and asked and that was a requirement so,

B.58:  Huh, yeah.  

A.59:  So,

B.60:  No, I mean most of the sports cars are stick shift.  

A.61:  Well, I'm not even sure all of them are anymore.  At least in this area.

B.62:  Huh.  

A.63:  Not that I was looking for sports cars, but, now the people I've talked to
don't seem to have stick shift.

B.64:  Huh.   

A.65:  And so why do you like stick shift?  

B.66:  Uh, I guess I, I grew up on it and it's fun.  It's, it's an enjoyable part
of driving.  I do feel like I have, uh, more control --

A.67:  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  -- over the car and it, it, to me, it gives me more, a lot more control in
snow and ice --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- and slick conditions.  

A.71:  Right.  

B.72:  Uh, it, i-, it does, uh, I don't know, it, it's really more fun than
anything else.  As long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic, it's fun
[laughter].

A.73:  Right, and actually it's probably safer on, you know, at long trips because
it keeps you more active.

B.74:  Yeah, yeah [sniffing].  

A.75:  So,

B.76:  Yeah, uh, of course, I like gadgets and, and, uh, fun things,

A.77:  [Laughter].

B.78:  [Laughter] on the cars, which are all the things, course, the c-,
