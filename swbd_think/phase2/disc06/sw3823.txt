======================================================================

B.1:  So have you remodeled your house recently?  

A.2:  I haven't done too much, uh, I mostly get stuck doing repairs like b-,
replacing a broken window where the neighbor threw a rock through the window
with his lawn mower [laughter].

B.3:  Can you do that yourself or do you have it done?  

A.4:  I did that myself and it kind of surprised me.  I just paid attention to
how I took it out and went to the hardware store and got a new one [laughter]
and put it back in.

B.5:  And then you put putty around the edges?  

A.6:  Yeah, yeah, that's all there was to it.  

B.7:  I'm, I'm impressed that you did that, though [laughter].  

A.8:  Well, the screen still has a hole in it [laughter], so don't be too
impressed.

B.9:  We, uh, live in our current house about three years and we've only done
minor repairs like painting, and we did put a new roof on, but previously we
had owned a eighty year old house in another city --

A.10:  Oh, wow.  

B.11:  -- and that's where I got my real experience at repairs and so I've
replaced many windows [laughter].

A.12:  [Laughter] I'll bet you have.  

B.13:  But they had wooden, they were wooden windows.  

A.14:  Uh-huh.  

B.15:  And, uh, I don't know, for some reason it, the putty seems easier or
something because it blended in.

A.16:  Yeah, yeah, what all did you do to your eighty year old home.  Did you
totally remodel it or had,

B.17:  Well, we had a lot of it done.  I can't claim to have done much of it.  It
had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so --

A.18:  Uh-huh.   

B.19:  -- that they were all, uh, even, t-, I forgot what you call that where you
[laughter] skim the top and then revarnish.

A.20:  Oh, yeah.  

B.21:  And we had, it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done.
We bought, when we bought the house, uh, most of the walls were covered in
fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it, once that,
the previous owners had their furniture out, it looked pretty bad.  So we --

A.22:  Oh, yeah.  

B.23:  -- then we took down the, uh, fabric to find huge plaster cracks.

A.24:  Oh, no [laughter].  

B.25:  Not unexpected, I suppose.  

A.26:  Right, right.  

B.27:  So we repaired a lot of that and then, uh, we didn't do any real major, we
moved just a couple walls and we put in new bathroom fixture, not, we kept the
fixtures, but we put in like a new, we did put in a new bathtub and then we
sort of bought the antique looking, you know --

A.28:  Oh the,

B.29:  -- the brass plumbing type thing -- 

A.30:  Oh, yeah.  

B.31:  -- although it was new.  

A.32:  Uh-huh.  

B.33:  I like old houses, but it just, everyone talks about it, it's true, small
bathrooms and small closets.

A.34:  That, that's right, yes, I lived for a while in Ohio and I was so impressed
with the old homes there that [laughter], the big old homes, but I know people
were constantly remodeling them and fixing them up.

B.35:  And plumbing, you have to know a lot about plumbing [laughter].

A.36:  That's right, and those lovely old homes had no insulation whatsoever.

B.37:  That's right.  

A.38:  [Laughter]. 

B.39:  You know, we had, we ran into an interesting complication.  Uh, our house,
it had fifty-six windows, so we decided,

A.40:  [Breathing].

B.41:  you know, with an exorbitant heat bill, we decided one way we would attack
that, we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic, a, a
lot of it --

A.42:  Uh-huh.

B.43:  -- because we didn't have very much.  The problem, and we never anticipated
it, was in the summertime the humidity, it, it would rise and in the
stairwell, at the top of the stairwell, it literally would, uh, the humidity
would condense on the walls,

A.44:  [Laughter].

B.45:  so this the walls would sort of sweat, and when we had an engineer come
out and talk, he just said that we had over insulated our house so it, quote,
couldn't breath [laughter].

A.46:  [Laughter]. 

B.47:  And so the humidity when it would, you know, the, the highest point would
go up there and then, and then would condense and it was, it was really a
problem.

A.48:  I'll bet it was.  Did it damage the walls?  

B.49:  [Breathing] Well, not, you could, I don't know, I'm sure over the long
term it would, and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the, in
the paint.  Uh, we put in, the first thing we tried, we just put in a fan in
that area, so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help.

A.50:  Uh-huh.  

B.51:  Uh, we actually took a screen, uh, doo-, window off one of the [laughter]
windows [breathing] to try and allow a little ventilation in that area.

A.52:  Uh-huh.  

B.53:  And then the truth is, it then became cooler weather and then we sold our
house [laughter].

A.54:  [Laughter].  

B.55:  And I never, I always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem,

A.56:  [Laughter]. 

B.57:  next year.  It's all those things you don't necessarily want to tell them,
I don't know, I mean, we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything, you 
just,

A.58:  Well, you give it your best shot.  

B.59:  We gave it our best shot.  

A.60:  Yeah.  

B.61:  But it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious
and,

A.62:  [Laughter]. 

B.63:  (( )).  

A.64:  And overdid it, huh.  

B.65:  Perhaps we overdid it.  

A.66:  I'll bet that eighty year old house had a lot of pretty moldings.

B.67:  Its prettiest features, it had beautiful wood molding, high ceilings and it
had beautiful cut glass french doors --

A.68:  Oh. 

B.69:  -- and, uh, I suppose that was, is, it's prettiest features, b-, and the,
and the floors were beautiful.

A.70:  Uh-huh.  

B.71:  But, it, much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas.  

A.72:  Uh-huh.  

B.73:  I don't, I only have friends there.  I don't think I have the energy or the
money,

A.74:  [Laughter]. 

B.75:  [Laughter] for those sort of beautiful old homes now.  

A.76:  No, I just recently helped a friend put up crown molding in the, in his
guest bedroom up around the ceiling --

B.77:  That's,

A.78:  -- because it was a ten foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small
room t-,
