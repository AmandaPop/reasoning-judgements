A.1:  Michael, how do you uh feel about the metric system?

@B.2:  Well, uh, I, I was just talking to my dad about that just
uh, a couple of weeks ago and I think, I think it would be great
that we went to it and, uh, the one thing though that I think we
should do, if we go to the metric system, then we should do away
with the other system.

A.3:  Well,

B.4:  And, and have only the metric system.

A.5:  Yeah.  I will tell you.  I was thinking about it while I was
waiting for a connection.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  And I, in my business I have to do conversions back and
forth --

B.8:  Right.

A.9:  -- between metric tons and, uh, then I have converted into
barrels --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- and gallons --

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  -- and then, it was long tons and so forth and so on and I
will admit that it does make it, uh, --

B.14:  Yeah.

A.15:  -- uh, perhaps a little bit cumbersome.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  At the same time, I don't know, it's one of the oddities, one
of the few things that are left, you know, is, it's, as the world
shrinks we become more and more homogenized.  Everybody --

B.18:  Well, that's true.

A.19:  -- yeah, it seems to, uh, uh, [throat_clearing] you know, it,
it's like --

B.20:  Yeah.

A.21:  -- it's like accents even.  You know, there's not, usually
there is great variation across the U S.   Now with television --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- everybody is beginning to sound like, uh, a news, uh,
announcer.  You kn-, 

B.24:  Yeah, that's true.  You are right.  #You're right.#

A.25:  #And, and the# whole, I #don't know,# 

B.26:  #There's no, we're losing,# we are losing our culture.

A.27:  Yeah, #but I# --

B.28:  #Of our area.#

A.29:  -- I don't know I kind have got a soft spot in my, uh, my
heart for feet and inches even though I, I like I say, in, in my
business I do have to, uh --

B.30:  Sure, yeah.

A.31:  -- to work around it.

B.32:  Yeah.  Well, I uh, I work in a hospital and of course that's
all we use #and# --

A.33:  #Yeah.#

B.34:  -- and every thing, we do is metric you know.  And, uh, you
know, weights is in kilograms and, uh, you know, whatever,
whatever happens to be the thing that we are measuring it's in
metric.  #And, uh,#

A.35:  #You know# I think one thing, one of the reasons that I've
got some hesitancy about doing it, is that I still have a
difficult time [sniffing].  I mean there are few
[throat_clearing] of pieces of the metric system that I can
visualize --

B.36:  Yeah. Yeah.

A.37:  -- okay, I, I, have gotten pretty good at and you know I
realize that about long a meter is.

B.38:  Right, right.

A.39:  Okay.  But as far as you know and it's, uh, I've kind of got
the inversion of different parts of the metric system where I am
comfortable with it --

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  -- but I am not with weights --

B.42:  Yeah. 

A.43:  -- and until, I guess it would be something if I had been, uh,
uh, a little more educated in it or forced into using it more.

B.44:  Yeah.  #Yeah, sure.#

A.45:  #Then# I would be more #comfortable# --

B.46:  #Right.#

A.47:  -- with it.

B.48:  Well, uh, uh, what, one of the things that really, I really
think that would be sort of weird is, is the uh, cars, the miles
per hour.  Instead of having not having kilo, kilometers per
hour.

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  Cause it, it's hard to imagine, you know, I, well I think the
problem with us, our generation is that nobody, even if we did go
all the way to the metric system, that we are still going to
think in terms of how it relates to the other system, you know.

A.51:  Well, sure.  It taken #new gener-,#

B.52:  #No# matter what.

A.53:  It would take a new generation to be just, you know,
#completely# --

B.54:  #That's right.#

A.55:  -- metric.

B.56:  That's right.  Because it's hard to, it's just like, uh,
another language I guess.

A.57:  Yeah, I think you're right [sniffing].

B.58:  And when you learn another language, uh, I guess what you
have to do is try to think in that language --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- and not think in terms of translating it to English, you
know.

A.61:  Well --

B.62:  But,

A.63:  -- [Throat_clearing] you know, they are trying, in one of
the, in one of the parts of the question they ask, ask us to
discuss was, uh, uh, why, why the first --

B.64:  Yeah.

A.65:  -- attempt --

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  -- failed.  You know and I think, I don't know, I, I don't
really have a good answer for that other than I guess it was just
that much uh, uh resistance to change.

B.68:  I think so too and I think that, uh, that it was pretty much
optional, wasn't it, at the time?

A.69:  That's true.  #And,# --

B.70:  #And, and, uh,#

A.71:  -- and the other thing too, they, they were going to use both
systems.

B.72:  Yeah, that's right see.

A.73:  You know simultaneously.

B.74:  That's why I think it is.  I think they used both systems and
everybody as long as they had inches --

A.75:  Right.

B.76:  -- they could just transpose back and forth and it made it
difficult for everybody thought well this is too much trouble,
but, uh, of course, if you didn't have anything available but
metric, I think it would be a little easier on you, #you know.#

A.77:  #Yeah, they# didn't until uh, [throat_clearing] you know, uh,
strawberries or anything, but kilograms --

B.78:  That's right.  #That's right.#

A.79:   -- #then you know# rather than pounds.

B.80:  You, you would just quit thinking, you wouldn't worry about
how many ounces is this --

A.81:  Sure.

B.82:  -- you would just say well how many, how many, uh, grams is
it, you know.

A.83:  Yeah, and, and then you could you know, peek at the chart,
but seeing you know a quantity --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- and they would say, well hey that, you know, that's, that
looks to be about two pounds and, uh, hey, that's this much, you
know in metric system.

B.86:  Sure.

A.87:  Yeah.

B.88:  Yeah, yeah and it's, uh, like weight.  You know, I weigh about
a hundred and sixty-five and that's, uh, somewhere in the
neighborhood of seventy something kilograms, you know, and it's
hard to imagine well only seventy something.  You feel like you
don't weigh much, #you know.#

A.89:  #Uh-huh.#  Uh-huh.

B.90:  But, I guess if that's the only thing you knew, well you
would just know, well I weigh seventy something kilograms and
that's it, you know [laughter].

A.91:  Yeah.  Of course, I've, I do think there is always, that,
there's still kind of a [throat_clearing] I don't know, a romance
if you will #with the# --

B.92:  #Well,# that's true.

A.93:  -- idea of a yard being the, uh, uh, link from the king's nose
to the tip of his finger, or, you know.

B.94:  [Laughter]  Yeah. 

A.95:  [Laughter].

B.96:  I understand that.  It's, that's true.  That's very true.
#That's very true.#

A.97:  #So, I, uh,# you know, it it's that and I think I don't know
do all these other old English stories that go back --

B.98:  Yeah.

A.99:  -- you know with #our# --

B.100:  #That's# right.  

A.101:  -- with our uh with our system,

B.102:  [Laughter].

A.103:  of measurement.

B.104:  It's funny that, uh, I guess all that started in England, I
guess --

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  -- all the systems of measurement and now, uh, we are still
using it and they are gone.  They have left it.  You know.

A.107:  Yeah, uh-huh, although there are,
