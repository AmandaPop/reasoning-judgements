===========================================================================

A.1:  Uh, what kind of lawn and garden work do you wind up doing?

@B.2:  I have, um, we own a house that we rent --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- out --

A.5:  Okay.

B.6:  -- and I, I rent the house that I live in.

A.7:  Okay.

B.8:  And the house that I'm rent-, the house that I live in, uh, the landlord
provides the yard work.

A.9:  Okay.

B.10:  The house that we own, I provide the yard work.

A.11:  Okay.  This sounds kind of like, uh, uh, uh, slightly --

B.12:  I know.

A.13:  -- jumbled #situation there.#

B.14:  #[Laughter]# And the, the one that I live in is not nearly so nice as the
one I rent out.

A.15:  Oh.  Uh, good income (( )).

B.16:  I want to preserve the, the value of the house by making sure the yard is
taken care of.

A.17:  Yes.  Okay.

B.18:  So I, I go over to my other house and mow the yard and plant bulbs and
flowers and,

A.19:  Yes.  Do, do you enjoy gardening?

B.20:  I adore it.

A.21:  Yeah, it's real relaxation.

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Uh, my father ran a service station for thirty-nine years --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and his, I mean, when I was a kid I didn't realize how true it was, but
he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind, to wind down
after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And especially, you know, just hoeing, just hoeing up the weeds.  It was,
that was therapy to him.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  I guess it still is, but, uh, somehow it didn't seem that way when I was
like ten years old but,

B.30:  Did you mow the yard when you were younger?

A.31:  Oh, yeah, #yeah.#

B.32:  #(( )) do it.#

A.33:  Um, we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn --

B.34:  Ooh.

A.35:  -- between our, my parents' house, and our next door neighbors.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  They were a rather elderly couple, so we cut their lawn for them.  But, uh,
there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept.  So with the kids and dad,
we kept it worked up pretty well.  It was a lot of fun as long as, you know,
your heart was in it, at least to some extent or another.

B.38:  Do you still do yard work?

A.39:  Well, uh, since I moved away from home, I got to live in a place that #had#
--

B.40:  #Oh.#

A.41:  -- a yard.

B.42:  [Laughter].

A.43:  So, [laughter] not really.

B.44:  Do you do anything, anything like, um, uh, house plants or,

A.45:  Yes, we've actually gotten to the point where, uh, for a while I couldn't
seem to keep anything alive.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  I couldn't even grow weeds in the house.  

B.48:  [Laughter].

A.49:  But about three years ago, my wife and I somehow or another seemed to have
turned into green thumbs.  We got, we pinched off, a, uh, a couple of a twigs
--

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- of a house plant of her mother's.

B.52:  Oh, gosh.

A.53:  We wrapped them in a wet paper towel --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- and brought them home with us, and put them in a jar of Miracle Grow and
water --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- and these, this thing took off, and we planted them, and now it's a
plant, uh, the plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy, but
only about eight inches high --

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  -- off the top (( )).  This thing's about five feet tall now.

B.60:  Ooh, what is it?

A.61:  I don't know.

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  It, it's just, you know, some little broad leaf something or other which,
that, uh, it's, it's got real thick, thick stalks to it that, like I say, 

B.64:  [Laughter]. 

A.65:  there's a couple of those stalks over five feet tall.

B.66:  [Laughter] #Oh.#

A.67:  #But, uh,# they're just growing like mad.  Once we got that thing going we
wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real
well.  Some people gave us some aloe vera, and it's --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- it's doing well, #I mean, it's had it's bad spots but# --

B.70:  #I killed an aloe vera.#

A.71:  -- it, it's had its rough times but, yeah, but it's doing real well now.

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  Um, I brought her a, uh, a couple of, I don't even know what they're
called.  Looks like overly large lawn grass --

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  -- but it's just a broad leaf type of lawn, kind of like a leaf on a stalk
of corn --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- but uh #greener, short house plant,#

B.78:  #Oh, yeah, corn plants.#

A.79:  Pardon?

B.80:  Those are called corn plants, or Dracaena, or they're some kind of
Dracaena, but common name's corn plants, I thi-,

A.81:  Well, it doesn't get a stalk.  It does --

B.82:  Oh.

A.83:  -- the leaves all come out of the center.

B.84:  Oh --

A.85:  It doesn't #really# --

B.86:  -- #huh.#

A.87:  -- resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself, is about like the
shape of a leaf, a leaf on a stalk of corn.

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  But it's not on a stalk, it's just all out of the center.

B.90:  Huh, that's (( )), I know I have one of those that's not doing very well,
but, I think I know what you're talking about.

A.91:  Yeah, and, uh, it doesn't seem to flower any.  And, let's see, we've got a
little, somebody gave us a Fichus, and, uh, #when we first got it.#

B.92:  #You haven't killed it?#

A.93:  No, well, we came close, we got really close.  

B.94:  [Laughter]. 

A.95:  Um, when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from the front
porch to the, uh, inside --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside --

B.98:  Uh-huh.

A.99:  -- and it shed almost all its leaves --

B.100:  Uh-huh.

A.101:  -- it looked really scraggly and rough, and when somebody finally told us
the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them,
