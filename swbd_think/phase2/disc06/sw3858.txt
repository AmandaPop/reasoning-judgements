=====================================================================

A.1:  Why don't you start, because I'm sure you've seen more movies than I have
[laughter].

@B.2:  I don't know.  Um, let's see, have you seen JOHN F. KENNEDY?

A.3:  No, have you?

B.4:  No, I wanted to go see that one.  I was hoping [laughter], my roommate went
and saw it and she liked it.  What about, um, THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE?

A.5:  No, and I, I heard some bad reviews on that.

B.6:  It's supposed to be kind of scary.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  Well, let's.

A.9:  Yeah.  Have you seen any lately?  

B.10:  No [laughter].  #Well, I mean,#

A.11:  #What about videos?#

B.12:  Um, let's see.  Well, actually, I have seen one.  I'm trying to think of
the name of it.  Um, it's got Bruce Willis in it, and, um.

A.13:  Is it a new one with him?

B.14:  Yeah.  But I can't think of who's in it.  But it was real good.

A.15:  It wasn't HUTCH AND HOCK was it?

B.16:  No, that was horrible.

A.17:  Oh, I [laughter] didn't see that one.

B.18:  Um, it's the guy from the IN LIVING COLOR.

A.19:  Oh, even, I mean, Keenan, Winey, uh, [laughter].

B.20:  Oh, you like, well, you know who I'm talking about?

A.21:  Yeah, I guess so.  

B.22:  I'm trying.

A.23:  Ivory was his last name.

B.24:  Well, I can't think of it.  But that was, it was really, I thought, I liked
it because it was funny --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and they had so many, it was, I mean, it was really action packed and it
was bloody, but they had a lot of, um, like one liners and stuff.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  I cannot think of the name.  I'm so bad with names of movies.

A.29:  [Laughter] Well, I had a little more time to think while they were trying
to find somebody --

B.30:  Oh, really.

A.31:  -- and, you know, I haven't seen, I haven't seen, um, any current releases.
My husband and I just don't get out to movies that much.

B.32:  Do you have children?

A.33:  Uh, no, but we, we're lazy.  

B.34:  Oh.

A.35:  [Laughter] We like to rent and watch them and be able to rewind them and
say, What he say?

B.36:  I hear you.  Well, Leslie, there's, um, a ton,

A.37:  We saw, well, we saw FLATLINERS, I like that a lot.

B.38:  Gosh, that's been out a long time [laughter].

A.39:  Yeah, and, um, let's see, AWAKENINGS, did you see that?

B.40:  No.  What was that like?

A.41:  Oh, it was great, it was real good.  It was kind of, and it's a true story,
or so they say --

B.42:  Oh, really?

A.43:  -- yeah, about these people that, that, uh, like near comatose, I guess
you'd say, and they, uh, with medication they're able to wake them up --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- af-, after like twenty, thirty years, and, I mean, it's not a real
action packed movie, but it was pretty neat.

B.46:  I remember the name of that now.  It's called THE LAST BOY SCOUT, with
Bruce Willis, and --

A.47:  #Oh {long and drawn out}.#

B.48:  -- #and I can't think# of the other name, the guy's name.

A.49:  And did you like that one?

B.50:  #Yeah.#

A.51:  #You did.#  

B.52:  It was good.

A.53:  Okay, and.

B.54:  I'm trying to think, well, uh, we liked CITY SLICKERS, since you watch, um.

A.55:  You know, I've been wanting to, I, every time I go to the movie store to
rent that, it's all rented.

B.56:  That's the same w-, same with me.  

A.57:  Yeah, I mean, I've been at least three or four times just to get that
movie, and every time I go, I guess I must be going at the wrong times.

B.58:  Okay, well, um, let's see.

A.59:  I did see BEAUTY AND THE BEAST [laughter].

B.60:  Well, I want to go see that one.  I'll probably wait --

A.61:  #It's beautiful.#

B.62:  -- #until it comes# out on video, because I don't think I can get any of my
dates to take me.

A.63:  Yeah, [laughter].  Just go to a matinee.

B.64:  [Laughter] Well, I told,

A.65:  There's so many kids there nobody will not-, notice that you're not, you 
know --

B.66:  Doing it?  

A.67:  -- with a kid.  

B.68:  Well.

A.69:  I said there's so many people you won't notice you're not, they won't
notice you're not with anybody.

B.70:  Yeah, that's true.  Well, um, what about, did you see DANCES WITH WOLVES?

A.71:  Yes.

B.72:  I saw that two or three times.  And then what's the other one Kevin Costner
was in?

A.73:  Um.

B.74:  ROBIN HOOD.

A.75:  Yeah, I saw that one, too.  

B.76:  Okay.

A.77:  Did you like that one?

B.78:  Yeah.  I've, I've probably seen it about three times.

A.79:  Did you?

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  That was a pretty long one.

B.82:  Yeah, but I like Kevin Costner.

A.83:  How many times did you see DANCES WITH WOLVES?

B.84:  I only watched that once.

A.85:  You did?

B.86:  Yeah, and I cried.

A.87:  Uh, I did, too.  It's so sweet.

B.88:  Uh, I could probably tell you more that I want to see than I have seen.

A.89:  [Laughter].

B.90:  What about, um, FRIED GREEN TOMATOES?

A.91:  Yeah, I want to see that one, too.  My husband kind of when, Um?

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  So he wasn't real excited about going to see that one.  Have, may have to
go with my mom [laughter].

B.94:  Well, a friend of mine went to see is it, what's the name of it, FATHER OF
THE BRIDE, with Steve Martin, and she said that was real cute.

A.95:  Oh, really?

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  Yeah, I'll probably wait for that one to come out on video.  It has to be
real good for me to spend the money.

B.98:  What about the one with, um, Arnold Schwarzenegger or whatever.

A.99:  Which one?

B.100:  TERMINATOR TWO.

A.101:  Oh, I haven't seen that one, either.

B.102:  Well, that's good, I cried at that one, too.

A.103:  You cried in TERMINATOR TWO?

B.104:  Yeah, at the, at the end, I won't tell you, but.

A.105:  Okay [laughter]. 

B.106:  (( )).

A.107:  Let's see, uh, did you say you'd seen FLATLINERS?

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  Yeah, okay, what about, let's see, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS? 

B.110:  That I saw for the first time, uh, probably about two weeks ago.

A.111:  I just loved that movie.  

B.112:  Uh-huh.  #That's cute.#

A.113:  #That was so sweet.#

B.114:  Then there're some, what are some other ones?  I wonder, I haven't really
seen that many new ones.

A.115:  Oh, no, I haven't either.  My, in, in fact, we're supposed to go out to
movies tonight, but I don't know what we're going to go see.

B.116:  No, it's too late, now.

A.117:  Yeah, well, we might be going to a late one.  #Yeah.#

B.118:  #Oh.# Well, um, trying to think what else I've seen, that's, I guess if I
see them, it's because they come on H B O or whatever.

A.119:  Yeah, see, we've got H B O and, you, they have to be pretty old to get on
there.

B.120:  Oh, really?

A.121:  Well, I think so.  I think they have a lot of the same ones run over and
over again.

B.122:  Well, see now, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS has been on there like every week, now.

A.123:  Yeah --

B.124:  #I'm try-,#

A.125:  -- #that's what I# hate, is they overdo it, when, you know, when they get a
major release.

B.126:  And then, well, what about the one with Tom Cruise in it that's an old one?
DAYS OF THUNDER.

A.127:  Yeah, I haven't even bothered watching that one.

B.128:  Really?

A.129:  Yeah, is it good?

B.130:  It, well, it's okay.  Probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan.

A.131:  Yeah, well, my dad is, if you can believe that.  But I'm not a real Tom
Cruise fan.

B.132:  Oh, really?

A.133:  No, he's okay, but I don't think, I don't see, uh, what I guess all the
young girls see in him.

B.134:  [Laughter].
