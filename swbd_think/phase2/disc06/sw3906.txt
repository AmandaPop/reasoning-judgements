=============================================================================

B.1:  Do you feel you are paying too much in tax?

@A.2:  Oh, I've, I always felt I was paying too much for everything [laughter].
That's part of my problem.  I wonder if we wouldn't be better off, uh, with a
little more free enterprise than having the government do some much for us.

B.3:  Yeah.

A.4:  That's one of my, I don't know.  Those are some of my feelings.  I think
free enterprise does it for a better price.

B.5:  I think you are right there.  It might be a little more ruthless, uh, to go
with a free enterprise system.  The government has sort of a habit of
investing in things that don't pay much return and getting into projects that,
uh, there is no yield on the investment.  So it's all money down the rat hole
[children_talking].

A.6:  Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't seem like we really get our, uh, I don't know,
I don't think we get the best for the buck, if that's, that's a good way to
put it [children_talking] but, uh, uh, did, do you live close to, uh, you know,
to a government installation of any kind or,

B.7:  No, I am, uh, sort of in Fairfax County, working for, uh, one of the free
loaders on the government,

A.8:  [Laughter]. 

B.9:  [Noise] government contract group --

A.10:  Uh, I guess you know it from the contract side.

B.11:  -- uh, so, you know somebody once accused, uh, accused us of, uh, being a
welfare program for engineers.

A.12:  [Laughter] Yeah.  My father worked, uh, for the government, uh, here in
Utah, at the Hill Air Force Base --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- for, uh, you know, that was the occupation that he had all the time I
was growing up and we got a good living out of it, but I know, just from
talking with him, there were, it was like you said there are a lot of things
that go on that just make you wonder --

B.15:  Yeah.

A.16:  -- that they don't really even get the best out of the [child_talking]
people that are working for them.  So it makes me wonder where we're --

B.17:  Well,  

A.18:  -- where we're going with that.  

B.19:  I think my father went through his life [noise] saying that he just keeps
paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes and he never got anything out
of the,

A.20:  [Laughter].

B.21:  government for it.

A.22:  Yeah.

B.23:  Yeah.

A.24:  Well, uh, they provide a lot of services that we don't [whistling] --

B.25:  Yeah.

A.26:  -- that you know we don't really fear no others I guess [noise], but it
just seems like if, if we had you know some kind of, uh, private enterprise
system.

B.27:  Well, the welfare is a good example that, uh, [noise] you know, if welfare
is handled at the local level by small groups like the Churches and some of
the organized charities that --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- that get people involved --

A.30:  Uh-huh.

B.31:  -- directly, then the money gets right straight to the people and there is
a lot of volunteer work and supporting that type of operation.  But you let
the government handle it [child_talking] and the next thing you know you are
spending four out of five dollars just to administer it.

A.32:  Yeah.  #Uh,#  

B.33:  #And# it just seems like nothing gets down to the people.

A.34:  I think that's a really good point.

B.35:  [Laughter].

A.36:  I think, you know, welfare is one [noise] one of the big problems and it's
interesting that and, uh, anyway interesting to me that like in the foreign,
in Russia and most areas where they are having their struggles right now, you
know, they are going to have to have [noise] a welfare system --

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  -- in order, in order to improve their life over there.

B.39:  Yeah.

A.40:  And I hope they don't pattern theirs after our [noise].

B.41:  Yeah.

A.42:  [Laughter].

B.43:  Well, I am afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do.  Uh,
I think one of my biggest concerns on taxes is, uh, real estate, uh, taxes
down at the local level.  The federal government seems to be pretty stable.
You know, you can figure out what they're going to charge you next year
[bird_squawk].

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  But, uh, [bird_squawk] since I moved into this house [noise] five years
ago, real estate tax has doubled [children_talking].

A.46:  Um.

B.47:  And I am just afraid that by the time I am ready to retire and, uh, the
mortgage is paid off on this house, I won't be able to afford the taxes on it.

A.48:  Your monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payments.

B.49:  Yeah.

A.50:  Yeah, that is the,

B.51:  Well, that was true on the last house I bought.  I had a thirty year
mortgage on it and by the time I, uh, sold it, the, the tax payment was a
bigger part of the, uh, of the mortgage payment [children_talking].

A.52:  Huh.  That, that is scary.  Cause that really makes [noise] you wonder --

B.53:  Yeah.

A.54:  -- what they are doing with that.  #I, uh,#

B.55:  #And# I figure it's just that when I am ready to retire I am going to have
to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place.

A.56:  Uh-huh.

B.57:  Uh, and there is no control over it.  The accessors just come around and
say okay, you're assessment just went up twenty, thirty percent and, uh,
[bird_squawk] you know there's no recourse.

A.58:  And what, what do you think you get out of your taxes, your property taxes?

B.59:  Well, the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the
county services --

A.60:  Uh-huh.

B.61:  -- uh, and I, I hope that some of that is working efficiently.  We have a
pretty good school system.  I am a little concerned that there's too much
paper work there for them.
