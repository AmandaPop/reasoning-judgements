========================================================================

A.1:  You have kids in the Texas schools?

B.2:  Uh, I don't now.  My children are all grown, but they did go through the
Texas school system.

A.3:  You know, the way the question is worded, it sounds like the person who
made up the questions thinks there is something wrong.  The way they say is
there something seriously wrong indicates that she thought that there was
something wrong to begin with [laughter].

B.4:  Yeah, I guess it is a little bit.  #Do you,#

@A.5:  #Did you# like the schooling?

B.6:  Uh, yes, but it was in a smaller town and, uh, it was in a town where I
knew, uh, an awful lot of the people and kept track of them.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And I think that made a difference.

A.9:  So, they didn't grow up in Irving?

B.10:  No, uh, they grew up in, uh, a town in north Texas, in Sherman.

A.11:  Oh, yeah.

B.12:  Do you have children here?

A.13:  Yeah, I sure do.  I have four, uh, well three of them are in school.  In
the Plano schools and I really like the schools.

B.14:  Well, I think Plano has a fairly good system because, uh, uh, well just
looking by the, uh, some of the scores coming out, uh, my children, well we did
not, uh, they did not go to school until, uh, uh, junior high, but they were in
Sherman, Texas.

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  And one of my cousins was the Principal.  But some of the problems I see
now is I think, uh, some, uh, as I said my children have been out for quite a
while, but a lot of my friends have children and I can see a difference from
between when my sons went through and what their children are doing and it
seems to me that, uh, they, they're spending less and less, uh, uh, well, my
children had to have a lot more respect for their teachers than I think --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- the, the the students now days do.

A.19:  Yeah, I think you are right.

B.20:  And I think, there's the, uh, 

A.21:  [Throat_clearing].

B.22:  that respect hasn't, uh, carried over and, uh, uh, they, they're not being
taught respect.  Uh, unless, and I don't know what you can do about it other
than, you know, that is one of the the samp-, one of the examples I see.

A.23:  Yeah.  And that's such a hard line because parents want to have control
over their children, you know, so they won't, don't want anyone to discipline
them.  And yet, they also want this same person who doesn't have the authority
to discipline them to command respect and the two don't go hand in hand
[laughter].

B.24:  No.  I think also too, you're, you're right in the fact I think parents,
there is a lack of participation among parents.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  It's, uh, too often the school is used as a dumping ground.

A.27:  Not only that, but some of these parents now days work and that's a low
priority, you know.  That is just some place that the kids go while they work
[laughter].

B.28:  Yeah, uh, but you're right.  I hadn't thought about that.

A.29:  So, it's not like they have the time to sit and think about those kind of
things because, you know, they have job, career and you know, and other things
on their mind.

B.30:  But, uh, well also, you're, they don't go to the open houses, to the the
parent-teacher, you know --

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  -- there is just a very small minority of, uh, parents that do
that.

A.33:  That's right.  See my husband is the treasurer of the middle school that my
daughter goes to and they're just always amazed at the lack of participation
of the the parents and the things that they, you know, the programs that they
try to put on and no one comes and they, you know, finally have kind of
decided they're not interested and we, I guess we shouldn't be either and
that's kind of sad [laughter].

B.34:  That is.  I think, uh, one of the things that I see, of course this is, uh,
uh, again an outsider view, is too often that the school system is set up now,
uh, based on the way it was for the last two hundred years on, uh, a gregorian
society --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- uh, culture and the life styles now, like you said, there are too many
two parent, working parents and, uh, a lot of them work, uh, there is not your
nine to five shifts --

A.37:  That's right.

B.38:  -- there a lot of shifts.  And it's a shame,

A.39:  [Cough].

B.40:  they cannot set up school systems that, uh, are not based on a Monday
through Friday, uh --

A.41:  Kind of a job.

B.42:  -- kind of, you know, a job.  Or, uh, I wouldn't mind seeing evening, you
know, uh, utilizing the schools, uh,

A.43:  [Cough].

B.44:  opening up an evening, uh, you know, a morning school and an evening
school.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  That way, the, the buildings would, but now I am looking at other areas
where they're having problems with over crowding and, uh, [noise] of course,
you, you'd have to have more teachers for that also [noise] but, you could
utilize the buildings just as well and it would be based on the life styles of
their families.

A.47:  Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's exactly right [noise].

B.48:  So that's, uh, you know, that's just a possibility.  [noise] And again I
think also a lot of times, they, they,

A.49:  [Cough].

B.50:  there [noise] needs to be more emphasis on some of your basic education.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  Uh, reading skills especially.

A.53:  See, I have noticed with my elementary kids also that they want them to
grow up so fast.

B.54:  Oh yeah.  That's,

A.55:  You know, that they want them to have, it's good to teach them
responsibility but boy the punishment,
