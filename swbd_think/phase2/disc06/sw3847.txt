========================================================================

A.1:  I pushed it.

B.2:  Okay.

@A.3:  So what do you you in your lawn?  Do you do it yourself or do you hire
someone to do it?

B.4:  Uh, no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, uh, find that
it's really a little more economical, and we have, oh, I find that I have the
time, and I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas.  I used to live in Arizona,
and it was very con-, very frustrating, because I didn't have the watering
system and it was, it was just too much work --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- and not enough enjoyment.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  But over here we get enough water automa-, you know, naturally as well have
the automatic sprinklers, and --

A.9:  Yeah, right.

B.10:  -- so it's a lot more rewarding --

A.11:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.12:  -- so.

A.13:  Well, we do our own out here, uh, you know, mow it ourselves and
everything, but, uh, our water supply right now is bad.  We need rain badly
[laughter].

B.14:  Oh, that's right.

A.15:  Uh, we can water, here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays,
Saturday and Sunday, four days a week.

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  So.

B.18:  Is that enough during the hotter times of the year?

A.19:  It was this last summer, yeah.

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  Uh, now if it, we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four
times, you know --

B.22:  Yeah, yeah.

A.23:  -- but, uh, yeah, we do our law-, our, you know, mowing ourselves and
everything, and I do our [chiming] planting of bulbs and things where I can
have some spring flowers --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- and, uh,

B.26:  [Chiming] Yeah, I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting,
which I never did before --

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  -- and it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall,
because our past winters have been so cold, #um# --

A.29:  #Uh-huh.#

B.30:  -- they'd freeze down, and by the time they, the flowers would come back to
life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer
planting [laughter].

A.31:  Oh.

B.32:  So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and, and spending too much
money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding,
so --

A.33:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.34:  -- um, I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type
plantings and --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- see how that, you know, #feels.#

A.37:  #Yeah.# We have quite a few roses.  I just, uh, we, in fact we just pruned
them way down, and I just had to replace one of them, so I just bought that
yesterday, and I'll probably go outside today and plant that.

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  But, um, I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year
long.

B.40:  Yeah, those are enjoyable.

A.41:  I even had, uh, roses on my table for Christmas dinner --

B.42:  Oh, did you?

A.43:  -- which was really pretty, you know [laughter].

B.44:  Uh-huh [laughter].

A.45:  But, um, other than the roses I don't have too many flowers.  I plant
gladiolas --

B.46:  Um, those are nice.

A.47:  -- and those are always pretty, but they get so tall, and they, they bend
over so fast --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- you know.

B.50:  Yeah, yeah.  I haven't done much in, in bulbs.  In fact I received as a
Christmas present a, a planter that had bulbs in it, that we were supposed to
go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny
window, and it --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- it just grew like crazy, but I don't have [laughter] any flowers on it.
I don't know how long that takes, or --

A.53:  Um.

B.54:  -- if there's anything I need to do differently.  It's just nice and green
right now [laughter].

A.55:  Uh-huh, well, is it that, one of those Amaryllis?

B.56:  Uh, no --

A.57:  No, huh.

B.58:  -- I'm thinking White Narcissus or something --

A.59:  Oh, okay.

B.60:  -- like a pa-, like a white paper flower or so.

A.61:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.62:  And, uh.

A.63:  Do you have a big yard?

B.64:  No, not really, and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas, uh, they
have just the, the minimum square footage for lots, to where you get a little
bit of a backyard, we have a pool in our backyard, and --

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- we did plan it to where we have some, some play yard left over, but
it's, it's, um, you know, very small.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  But most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything
else in the backyard --

A.69:  Yeah, #right, right.#

B.70:  -- #that's about the size# of most of them.

A.71:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.72:  So, uh --

A.73:  Um.

B.74:  -- I guess we're kind of fortunate.  Everyone looks at that, with our yar-,
at our yard with kind of sense of awe, like wow, you really got, you know,
some grass [laughter] back there.

A.75:  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.76:  Well.

A.77:  Well, that makes it nice.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  Well, it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool,
but we don't have one --

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  -- you know, but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- you know --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- but we just, we just have dogs and, um, [laughter] --

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  -- and grass --

B.88:  Uh, yeah.

A.89:  -- you know, the cement work --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- and a little play set we made for a garden.  So we do have a garden, you
know.

B.92:  (( )).

A.93:  It's just a small one, you know, but we, had lots of tomatoes, and, uh,
zucchini --

B.94:  Oh.

A.95:  -- it's amazing what you can get out of a little --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- you know, it's probably about twenty by, I don't know, twenty by six,
something like that, and it's amazing what you can, you know, how many plants
you can plant in there --

B.98:  Yeah, yeah.

A.99:  -- but it was nice.  Few cucumbers.

B.100:  That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet, and --

A.101:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.102:  -- I don't think this yard is a very,
