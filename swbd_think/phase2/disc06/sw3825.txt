=======================================================================

B.1:  Well, this is an unusual topic.  What do you think about it? 

@A.2:  [Laughter] Yeah, I, at first I, it took eight times to find you
[laughter] so I told my husband, uh, you know, what should I say and then he
reminded me, but, uh, uh, [lipsmack] hi-, in his family, uh, what they usually
do, on his dad's side, his mom or, uh, the aunts will send out little
postcards, like, two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the, the,
where to meet and, you know, just, to bring anything, and so they just notify
everyone by mail, and then they just meet at, like, a park or something to
have like a, a short, uh, or a small, uh, dinner type thing.

B.3:  Well, that sounds great, Ellen.  How far away do they come from?

A.4:  Uh, they come from, well, they all meet in Portland and they come as far
as, oh, Seattle and, and sometimes we've gone and we were f-, we were living
in Utah at the time.

B.5:  Oh, okay.  

A.6:  And, uh, the, his, his dad's family is all around the area and his mom's
side of the family, they all, uh, have their family reunions in southern Utah
and people would come from Seattle to there and, uh, let's see, Nevada and in
that area, Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would, uh, assign a
different person, each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different
person to be in charge of notifying everybody.

B.7:  Oh, okay, that makes sense.  Nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than
once.

A.8:  Yeah, yeah and the people who are down there, like, they'll assign one
person in the Utah area, one person in the Washington area and that person can
call, you know, beforehand and just make sure everyone knows, too.

B.9:  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  And then they just sort of do like a little program or, you know, something
like that so --

B.11:  Yeah.  

A.12:  -- that everyone's sort of involved.  

B.13:  That's interesting.  You sound like you've had a lot of experience with
this, then.

A.14:  Oh, well, [laughter] that's my husband's side and my mom, my mom's, or my
family, uh, we all live in southern California so we just have to either or,

B.15:  [Laughter]. 

A.16:  give a formal invite and we're all there so,  

B.17:  Southern California's still pretty large.  

A.18:  [Laughter] Yeah well, I mean L A, Orange County area.  I mean --

B.19:  I see.  

A.20:  -- everyone's, you know --

B.21:  (( )).

A.22:  -- mostly not farther than an hour away.  

B.23:  Yeah, well, my experience, uh, has been limited pretty much lately to my
mother's side of the family.

A.24:  Uh-huh.  

B.25:  Uh, years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and, uh, they
haven't had a reunion since then.  They just show up at funerals and weddings.

A.26:  Oh [laughter].  

B.27:  It was pretty serious and lot of #yelling# -- 

A.28:  #Wow.#  

B.29:  -- and all that, but, anyway, my mother's side we had our, our first real
reunion that I've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from
out of town and they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and, uh, they had
some activity, they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and people
got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and, you know, a lot
of that sort of thing.  Since it was the first one that we'd had that, you
could do that once.  Now next time we have one, we'll have to think of
something more creative to do.

A.30:  Well, you know, that's interesting because one thing that always brings to
my, uh, husband's mother's side together is, uh, they talk about the genealogy
of the family tree every time and, uh, inevitably everyone is just very
interested and, and they always have, you know, two or three new ones to add
to the list, you know, someone's been born or --

B.31:  Oh. 

A.32:  -- someone passed away or, you know, something like that and so everyone
has to update their little --

B.33:  Well, have -- 

A.34:  -- books or whatever.  

B.35:  -- have you, do you have an interest in genealogy?  

A.36:  Uh, [lipsmack] I do, but not to, very much compared to my -- 

B.37:  Not a -- 

A.38:  -- mother-in-law.  

B.39:  -- passion, huh.  

A.40:  [Laughter]. 

B.41:  [Laughter] Uh, I suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and I, I
suspect we will do more of it.  Uh, I found out some, about some of the
relatives I didn't, you know, I, I didn't even know their names, some of 
the --

A.42:  Um.  

B.43:  -- two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and, uh,
there's a lot of things there you have to stop, their really kind of
fascinating.  I found out my grandmother was one of a twin.

A.44:  Oh. 

B.45:  And we don't even know where the twin, we have virtually no, no background
on, on her --

A.46:  Really?  

B.47:  -- on the twin.  

A.48:  Is it your, your grandma's own sibling and she,

B.49:  My grandmother's, uh, sister who would be somewhere in, in West Virginia.
I'm sure she's, you know, dead now, because my grandmother died in, about
twenty years ago.

A.50:  Oh, I see.  Oh so,

B.51:  I'm, I'm quite a bit, I'm probably a lot older than you are.  Uh,

A.52:  Well, maybe, uh, they just moved away and then sort of lost contact.

B.53:  I don't know.
