========================================================================

B.1:  The federal budget.  

A.2:  Yes.  

@B.3:  [Throat_clearing] Boy.  I was just writing something down that came to
mind as I observed what has happened in our society.  Um, we I think have
become, uh, dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that
really only we can do for ourselves.

A.4:  I agree with that.  

B.5:  And I think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to
that, uh, we have elected people who really don't know how to manage the
money, uh, they collect.

A.6:  [Gasp] Well, what we've got, uh, in my view is, [laughter] is a situation
where [breathing] we've got more people, like you say, that are c-, that are
accustom to being taken care of and #then be y-,#

B.7:  #I mean, I think# it really affects all of us to a, 

A.8:  #Yeah.#  

B.9:  #degree,# Glen.  I think we are, I mean I, I went through a P H D program
that was funded by the office of navel research that's now investigating
Stanford and Harvard and M I T.

A.10:  Yeah.  

B.11:  I mean we're talking about things that have done some good but have
institutionalized corruption.

A.12:  Well, I, I, really I think #if you [laughter] from a dif-,# 

B.13:  #I mean,# you know, I hate to admit that in a way, 

A.14:  #Yeah.#  

B.15:  #but it's,# 

A.16:  #I, I really do,# 

B.17:  #true.#  

A.18:  think that, I think the first thing that we need to do and it, it would be
a hard, uh, a hard, uh, medicine, uh, for everybody to swallow but I think
we're going to have to eventually balance the budget or we're going to sink.
We can't continue to pay the kind of interest that we're paying,

B.19:  #Right.  Well, and we need to,# 

A.20:  #on the deficits.# 

B.21:  spend the money better.  I mean we do not need eight hundred military bases
around the world.

A.22:  #That's true.# 

B.23:  #There are lot of# things we don't, we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco
farmers.  We don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are
wealthy fr-, I mean.  Basically, you know, it, it is really true that this,
this country is suffering because, uh, we are, it's not that we don't have the
resources, we are just squandering them.

A.24:  Oh, yeah, throwing them away.  Uh, it's just like, uh, in programs that are
federally funded that if they, if they don't spend their allotment th-,

B.25:  That's the way it was working on a defense department contract #((up
whe-,))#

A.26:  #Then they're,# then they're subject to losing the next year's,

B.27:  #Right.# 

A.28:  #allotment# [breathing],

B.29:  Well, that's the way the, that's the way the thing works.  

A.30:  Yeah, and go into a spending frenzy #at the year of the en-,#

B.31:  #That's right.# 

A.32:  #at year end.#

B.33:  #I've seen that# happen and it's, it's, what's even sadder and what I think
is the, the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and M I T
and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal
violations [throat_clearing] is that I think the attitude develops that we
deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't
function.

A.34:  Uh-huh.  

B.35:  And that, that's no license to steal.  

A.36:  Right.  That's true.  

B.37:  I mean I, I honest to God believe that's wh-, what's been going on and that
was sort of ((seeped)) into the way we operated in this context.

A.38:  #Well and,#  

B.39:  #And at the# time I, you know, people, I mean, it was, it was acceptable.

A.40:  #Well, and,# 

B.41:  #It's no# longer acceptable.  

A.42:  well, and so many people have, have, uh, the feeling that well, if it's, if
there, if it's federal money, then it's free money.  Well it's not.  It costs
everybody.

B.43:  Right.  

A.44:  And, uh, i-, you know, just because you can, uh, get something from the
feds, uh, that doesn't necessarily make it morally, uh, responsible.

B.45:  Right.  And it, it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a
lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do.  For example,
determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive.  And do a,
you know, variety of other things.  If we put the money in the right place
which is investing in people in the development of human capital in retraining
programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got
a high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a
competitive marketplace or went through college #or, or went out into the,#

A.46:  #Well, and, and# [laughter],

B.47:  marketplace and,

A.48:  Well, don't even began to talk about the educational system.  I mean that
is one (( )) where it's being proven that throwing money does not,

B.49:  #Right.# 

A.50:  #create# a good education.  

B.51:  #Well, and,# 

A.52:  #((Nor can)),# 

B.53:  as the product of the academy I can tell you, you know, if it were that
good, how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to
everybody?

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  How come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard, M I T, or Stanford
education?

A.56:  Yeah, but I'm even,

B.57:  #If it's that good, then you really,#

A.58:  #t-, I'm, I'm not even,# I'm not even talking about higher education.  I'm
talking about the, the kids that we've got now.  They come out of high school
that can't read and write.  And then also it just, even the ones that, that do
read and write that really have a very poor, poor grasp of, of what the
secondary education should have given them.

B.59:  Right.  But all the people who, who are responsible for handling these kids
were trained in universities and colleges.

A.60:  ((That's true)).

B.61:  Okay.  And my point is, hey, wait a minute.  Something is wrong here.
These people are claiming this is the best.

A.62:  Uh-huh.  

B.63:  Well, if it's the best, then it should be translated right on down the line
and the general, I mean,

A.64:  [Lipsmack].

B.65:  how long has Harvard been around?  

A.66:  Yeah.  

B.67:  Okay.  So ask yourself some questions.  Why don't we have a higher quality
with one of the world's great universities?  Harvard and Stanford both have
schools of education.

A.68:  Uh-huh.  

B.69:  I mean this is a focus.  It's not like this is an interest of theirs.

A.70:  Right.  

B.71:  This is a specific focus.  Two of the best funded institutions in the
country premier universities in the world, hey, wait a minute.  How come they
can't produce something like M T V,

A.72:  [Laughter]. 

B.73:  which kids want,
