was hard to understand.

===========================================================================

A.1:  #(( )) [TV] [breathing].#

B.2:  #Uh,# I mean, I guess I get it most (( )) or I get it from, uh, the paper
and the T V and, [swallowing] I guess, probably now the T V first, the paper
#second, radio third.#

A.3:  #Yeah.  Same here.# Uh, I hardly ever listen to news on the radio.  I don't
even know if [laughter] they have it anymore.

B.4:  Yeah.  I was just kind of think ((of the order)), #you know.#

A.5:  #Yeah.#  What do you think about, uh, you know, the second part of that
question was are they doing a good job.  I'm beginning to think, you know,
especially this week with all that stuff coming out #about# --

B.6:  #Yeah.#

A.7:  -- Clinton.  Uh [laughter].

B.8:  Yeah, I think it's, uh, I don't know, I mean, it's getting a little bit
ridiculous.  I mean th-, this, I don't know if you saw it yesterday but, uh,
((where I was at)) had it on C N N and, uh, they had that press conference
with that, uh, Jennifer Flowers.  Uh, Clinton's alleged, uh, mistress,
whatever.  And, uh, it just got to be so, I mean, it's ridiculous.  Because 
(( )) one of the questions was, uh, do, did, uh, Clinton use a condom and all
that.  #I mean# --

A.9:  #Yeah.#

B.10:  -- it was, i-, i-, the whole press corp was just #laughing.#

A.11:  #I, I# got a feeling that, you know, cause f-, from what, you know, I got
most of my information from the LARRY KING show and, uh, it was like nobody's
verified her story at all.  #And it# --

B.12:  #Right.#

A.13:  -- just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it witho-, and
nobody's been able to verify that she's telling the truth.  All, the only
thing they know is that she lied about everything else.

B.14:  Yeah.  I think, I mean, he probably did it.  I mean that's my belief.  I
just think that, you know, if he did it, (( )), you know, he should have said
so on SIXTY MINUTES and, cause, I mean, American public is pretty forgiving
and most times, yeah, if you do something, I mean what else #((can you, how
can you)).#

A.15:  #Would you go on# national television and, and, uh, tell the world that
you'd had an affair and, you know, and #your wife# --

B.16:  #Well now with,# 

A.17:  -- and her parents are listening and that would be kind of rough to do.  

B.18:  Yeah.  But I mean, the fact is now that he's left hims-, the fact that he
wouldn't deny it or confirm it was, he's just left himself open to further
digging #from# --

A.19:  #Yeah.#

B.20:  -- other reporters.  Now, you know, you know there's all types of rumors
now that Miss, uh, America, Miss Arkansas, all the way down to Miss Teen
Arkansas wh-, allegedly had a thing with him.  I mean it's just going to keep
dogging him.  I, I think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks.  Just
cause this is going to keep getting, the fact that he won't confirm or deny.
I mean, I mean he, he's, this has been going on for years though.  I mean --

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  -- he's always had rumors and stuff.  And,

A.23:  I thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart,
uh, got caught messing around and --

B.24:  Yeah and he,

A.25:  -- I thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this, the politics
but, uh.

B.26:  No.  It's just, I know, it's just.  I think my horror is just the fact
that he, uh, he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't.  And it was
totally #proven# --

A.27:  #Yeah.#

B.28:  -- wrong and then he challenged, you know, the press to, you know, prove
it.  And they did and that's what killed him.  #And# --

A.29:  #Yeah.#

B.30:  -- #Clinton# --

A.31:  #We're waiting.#

B.32:  -- on the other hand if he, if he, I mean, he took a big risk just even
going on T V the other night with his wife.  But [swallowing] I think his wife
came off better than he did.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  But, in the end I think he's just going to, his people now are, you know,
the, to fund the campaign, you know, they're going to wait and see what
happens.  And, you know, when he keeps, more stuff, more stuff keeps coming
out about him then I think he'll be out, i-, you know, he'll be out of the
race eventually cause the money is what, uh, f-, the only thing that matters
in the end.

A.35:  #Yeah.#

B.36:  #And# if he doesn't have any money #there's not,# 

A.37:  #Well,# when I heard, I guess it was yesterday, I heard that she'd gotten
in excess over a hundred #thousand dollars to talk to the, this# --

B.38:  #Of yeah.  She, she's a bimbo, I mean, you know.#

A.39:  -- tabloid thing.  I thought well, golly gee.  She's got to be lying.  I'd
say I slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks, you know?  Maybe
#[laughter] but,#

B.40:  #[Laughter]# Yeah.  But, I don't know.  I mean, it's just, the press is
alway going to be like that I think.  And --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- you know, I mea-, Amer-, most, I think that most people in America know,
I mean, my, people my age, you know, probably, probably really don't care, I
mean, what they, I really don't, you know --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- care what they do.

A.45:  Why has the #press gone overboard# --

B.46:  #As long as it doesn't,# 

A.47:  -- in telling us things?  And,

B.48:  But when the press says that, you know, some, it's, it's important, it's
got to be important because, I mean, they control, I mean, what's said and
everything and yeah, I think it's, I mean, yeah I think it's totally gone
overboard and I mean, it's su-, (( )) issues and everything and the timing of
this c-, can be more worse for him but he, he's clearly the front runner.
Now, he's about to get blown out of the water at this #time.#

A.49:  #Well,# if, if, if, if somehow he clears himself from this, he is all of a
sudden jumped out in front.

B.50:  #Yeah.#

A.51:  #Because# everybody knows his name and, and knows where he's from and knows
what he looks like.  And I'm not sure everybody knows all the other people at
all #((that are)) [/TV] [/breathing].#

B.52:  #Uh,# he, he, he had, I mean, he had the thing won.  But now I mean, I, I
just don't think he'll be around.  I mean this, this, if you go by past
history and, you know, he's, he's dodging the subject now, you know.  He says
he clearly stated, you know, what he had to say on SIXTY MINUTES.  He didn't
say anything.  All he said was that the American public knows that I'm
((mean)), you know, real hot, okay.  What do you mean, uh, Bill.  And, you
know, I'm not going to confirm or deny anything.  I mean, that's where you,
