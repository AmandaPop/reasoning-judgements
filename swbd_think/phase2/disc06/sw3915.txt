============================================================================

A.1:  Uh, Cissy.  What kind of books do you enjoy?

@B.2:  Uh, I, mysteries, murder mysteries, true murder mysteries.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And uh, tacky romances.

A.5:  Uh, huh.  Sounds like we like the same kind.

B.6:  What do you, what have you read lately?

A.7:  Well, see, I read the, uh, Helen McImes.  I read a trilogy of hers.

B.8:  Oh, I got that [noise].

A.9:  [Laughter].

B.10:  Uh,

A.11:  Uh, a group of three in one book.

B.12:  THE CRADLE WILL FALL, and is that the right gro-, that one? 

A.13:  Um.  She's the one that writes, uh, uh, they are real good.  She has been
writing for a long time and I was trying to remember.  She wrote one, uh, she
writes (( )) that kind of spy, uh, uh, thing, you know, with them, you know
setting in foreign places or, uh, and they're, they always have kind of a twist
to them.

B.14:  I've read, I've read a few of hers.  I was just thinking, I just read a
trilogy of Mary Higgins Clark.

A.15:  Oh, yeah.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  Actually that's why, that's why I got confused.

A.17:  Yeah.  Those are good too.

B.18:  And uh-huh.

A.19:  And then I got, uh, some of Robert Ludlum's. I like those too.  Do you
#like him?#

B.20:  #I've# read all of his.

A.21:  Yeah.  I get the Bourne, supreme, the Bourne ones. I get them all mixed up
[laughter].

B.22:  I can't, oh it's been so long since I have read them but I will buy those
in hardback.

A.23:  Yeah, I have a lot of those in hardback too.  And, uh, do you read FRIED
GREEN TOMATOES?

B.24:  No, is it a good book?

A.25:  Oh, it is wonderful!

B.26:  Where did you get it?

A.27:  Well, my daughter gave it to me.  Uh, quite a while ago to read and, uh,
then, uh, I guess what brought it to mind, uh, was that, uh, when I went to see
the movie and, uh, it did not disappoint me and it's, it's just so well
written.  Of course, Fanny Flag wrote it.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  And, uh, it's, uh, it's got humor in it and a little bit of suspense --

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  -- and, uh, yo-, and you will cry.

B.32:  So, I loved STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  I heard that it's similar to that.

A.33:  Well, I think, I didn't read STEEL MAGNOLIAS but I think it's probably
better than STEEL MAGNOLIAS were.  The movie is anyway.  And STEEL MAGNOLIAS
was tremendous.

B.34:  Yeah, that's one of my favorites.

A.35:  But, uh, this one is just, uh, part of it is, well my husband enjoyed it.
I, I just kind of, you know mixed feelings.  I didn't know whether he would.
It might be a woman's movie.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  But, he just, he just raved about the actors in it.  That they were so good
and everything was real and it was just really good and the reason my daughter
gave it to me is because my mother is in a nursing home --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and I think that, uh, she was trying to, uh, give me something to kind
of make me get a message of some kind [laughter].

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  But, uh, it was good.

B.42:  I might go get it cause I, I am reading NEWSWEEK right now and I am going
to be finished in a minute and BOOKSTOP stays open to eleven.

A.43:  Well, I would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in the first
few chapters.

B.44:  Oh, I, I don't do that.

A.45:  #Because,# 

B.46:  #I read# I read pretty quickly.

A.47:  Well you may have to, I do to and I had to go back and re-read.  Because
you have to get the, they're telling two stories at once.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  And you have to get it straight and get the names straight.  That's the
thing.  Get all the names straight.

B.50:  That could be difficult.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  Where you are working with two stories and once you get that down,
it's flows and you can't wait to get to the next part.  It, uh, it's one of
those that you get caught up in.

B.52:  I read, uh, PRINCE OF TIDES [noise].  I haven't seen --

A.53:  Oh.

B.54:  -- that movie yet.

A.55:  I haven't read that book.  Was it good?

B.56:  Yes, it was.

A.57:  Okay, I will have to see if I can get it.

B.58:  Well, I will bring it next meeting.

A.59:  Oh, all right.

B.60:  [Laughter].

A.61:  Wonderful.  #Wond-,#

B.62:  #Cause I don't# have anything to do with them when I finish with them.  You
can't sell them for anything.

A.63:  No you can't.  I would love to borrow it from you.

B.64:  Okay.

A.65:  All right.  Uh, we're all supposed to say what do we read for improvement.
What have you read for improvement?

B.66:  I read some self help books --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- but, I think, I like to spend my time reading for enjoyment --

A.69:  I do too.

B.70:  -- and, uh,

A.71:  Well, if you're like me there are so many technical things to read that
when I read at home,

B.72:  At work #yeah.#

A.73:  #Yeah.# I just don't want to, to, well of course, I, I garden a lot and I
read a lot of gardening things.

B.74:  I have NEIL by my bed.

A.75:  Oh, yes.  NEIL and then the AMERICAN GARDENING SOCIETY puts out a real good
book on vegetables.

B.76:  I don't have, I have got three dogs.

A.77:  Um, uh, you don't need vegetables.

B.78:  No.

A.79:  You have problems even with [noise] flowers.

B.80:  Well, yeah I do.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  They're in the front yard.

A.83:  Uh-huh.  Good place for them.  If the dogs,
