B.9:  Yeah, I am now [laughter].  

A.10:  Okay [laughter].

B.11:  Wonder what happened?  

A.12:  I don't know, I could hear you fine.  

B.13:  Oh, really?  

A.14:  Yeah.  

B.15:  I couldn't hear a thing.    

A.16:  #Huh.# 

B.17:  #Well,#  

A.18:  I was, I mean the whole time I could hear you say hello and, 

B.19:  #Oh.# 

A.20:  #I was trying to# -- 

B.21:  Gee.

A.22:  -- I, I'm on a cordless phone so I thought well maybe something happened.

B.23:  I was on a cordless when she called, but then I, uh, I never get it to work
so I had to go to my other phone.

A.24:  Oh.  

B.25:  Anyway we're supposed to be discussing clothing, right?  

A.26:  Yes [laughter].

B.27:  [Laughter]  Um, 

A.28:  At work I guess.  

B.29:  Yeah.  Where do you work?  

A.30:  Um, I work for T I.  

B.31:  Oh, you work for T I.  

A.32:  #And, um,# 

B.33:  #Oh, okay.# 

@A.34:  it's pretty casual.  I mean it can be pretty casual.  It seems like, um,
[throat_clearing] well with our weather that we have here in Texas that, um,
you can usually get about three seasons out of clothing.

B.35:  Yeah.  

A.36:  But the only stuff is sometimes I get more casual during the summer --

B.37:  Uh-huh.  

A.38:  -- and it doesn't last, you know, past Labor Day or I mean or what is the,
the one in the fall?

B.39:  Uh-huh.  

A.40:  Yeah.  You know, what I mean.  

B.41:  #Yeah, I know what you mean [laughter].#

A.42:  #Like white shoes [laughter] and that kind of thing.#

B.43:  ((All right, uh,)) yeah, I, uh, well I work for ((Lomas)) Mortgage and, uh,
[breathing] our office is so cold I usually try to wear, I wear suits most of
the,

A.44:  #Uh-huh.#

B.45:  #time,# except on Friday we have casual day.

A.46:  Uh-huh.

B.47:  I mean we can wear jeans.  I'm not a jeans wearer but I wear pants
[laughter].

A.48:  Uh-huh.

B.49:  But, uh, a lot of people in the office dress fairly casual most of the
time.

A.50:  And do your suits carry you through all four seasons or do you have lighter
suits that you wear?

B.51:  Uh, they do carry me through.  Yes.  Uh, most of them I can wear all year.
I just, you know, I just buy them.  They are, uh, Leslie Fay --

A.52:  Uh-huh.

B.53:  -- makes a haberdashery and, uh, I can even wash them in my washing
machine.

A.54:  Oh, great.

B.55:  [Lipsmack] Yeah, and, uh, so they're not too heavy for summer or winter or
just anytime.  So, I, I usually buy maybe a lighter color,

A.56:  #Uh-huh.#

B.57:  #you know,# like for the summer.  Then I won't wear the real light ones in
the winter but [sigh], 

A.58:  Huh.  Uh, well, I know that like my husband wears suits all year long, but,
you know, the men's suits seem to come in different weights like tropical
weight or --

B.59:  Uh-huh.

A.60:  -- you know.  I mean, he wears wool in the summer, but it's a lighter
weight and it i-, is, uh, a lot thinner so it breathes better than a, a
polyester would.

B.61:  Yeah.

A.62:  The wool does and, and I wear suits occasionally at work at, but a lot of
it depends on what I've got going.

B.63:  #Uh-huh.#

A.64:  #Like# if I'm, if I'm going to be meeting with customers then, uh, you
know, get all dolled up or #[laughter] ((whatnot)) dolled up but you know,#

B.65:  #Yeah.  ((Right))# [laughter].

A.66:  what I mean.

B.67:  Yes.  #Uh-huh.#

A.68:  #Um,# but if I'm just going to be sitting at my desk all day, then I don't
--

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  -- um, you know, dress up as much. 

B.71:  #Right.#

A.72:  #And i-,# it depends on what kind of meetings I have.

B.73:  Yeah.

A.74:  But, um, fortunately T I is flexible enough that, um, you know, I can do
that.

B.75:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, that makes it nice.

A.76:  Yeah.  Although right now I'm having [laughter] more difficulty finding
things to wear.  I'm expecting and --

B.77:  Oh, you are?

A.78:  -- and, uh,

B.79:  #Well, congratulations.#

A.80:  #I'm in that,# thank you, I'm in that in between stage where, where not
showing enough to wear maternity clothes but --

B.81:  Oh.

A.82:  -- but, uh, my old clothes are getting kind of tight, so.

B.83:  Yeah [laughter].

A.84:  So I started, um, one friend of mine at work ((lent)) me a bunch of units
stuff.

B.85:  #Oh, yeah.#

A.86:  #You know and,# 

B.87:  That's nice.

A.88:  Yeah, so that will be great to wear, you know, units pants with the
sweaters.  So fortunately, T I is flexible enough that, you know, we can dress
kind of casual like that.

B.89:  Uh-huh.

A.90:  Although I get, I get tired of it,

B.91:  #Yeah.#

A.92:  #you know,# and I don't have, I mean I had jeans but I ((couldn't)), I used
to wear on Fridays.  I think, uh, Friday has been my casual day since probably
high school.

B.93:  Uh-huh.

A.94:  Even through college it was,

B.95:  #Oh.#

A.96:  #just# kind of ingrained in me that Friday was always kind of a casual day.

B.97:  Yeah.

A.98:  So, I do that even at work.

B.99:  #Uh-huh.#

A.100:  #It's more,# i-, if I do wear jeans, that might be the day that I wear
them.

B.101:  Yeah, #well, our company is [laughter],#

A.102:  #But, but they don't fit anymore# [laughter].

B.103:  Our company allows jeans on Friday [lipsmack].  Uh, everybody wears, you
know, most everybody wears jeans, but they are kind of particular, you know,
what kind of jeans or what kind of shirts you wear with them, and, you know,
they want you to look nice.  And, uh, everybody is pretty good,
