=========================================================================

A.1:  you use credit cards.

B.2:  Convenience --

A.3:  (( )).

B.4:  -- uh, [laughter] I, I use them for, uh, everything.  Mostly I confine my
credit card to just one Mastercard --

A.5:  Do you?

B.6:  -- but, uh, I, I carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all
times.  Fortunately, uh, uh, I have a credit card, well, I have two,
Mastercards, one, uh, has a twenty dol-, it's a gold Mastercard, and it, uh,
has to pay a twenty dollar annual fee --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- but as long as I, I pay off every month, there's no interest charge.

A.9:  I see.

B.10:  But, and we never carry over, we pay off every month. 

A.11:  What is the advantage then of a gold card, because, um, you don't pay any
interest if you have a regular Mastercard or Visa?

B.12:  Well, one thing is, whenever we rent a car, we don't have to pay, uh, any
extra insurance, so the, we, uh, my husband's, uh, family lives in New
Hampshire, and, uh, it's about ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to
Boston.  So, uh, as a general rule when he goes up there, he rents a car, so
the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar
annual fee for having a gold card.

A.13:  I see, I see, we use to get the American Express card and stuff like that,
and then we just kind of got back to plain old Mastercard and Visa, uh,
because we never really had any, um, benefit that we thought was worth the,
the price of the special card.  So --

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  -- it may change if we do a lot of car rental, which we don't do --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- or other types of services.  I'm sure there're some things that come
along with the gold cards that are appealing, and, and, uh, I've just wondered
what they were.  They haven't been appealing to us so far.

B.18:  No, uh, unless there's some, no, I, uh, unless there's some advantage,
there's not any pr-, there's no prestige factory involved [laughter].

A.19:  Yeah, that, you know, I think that was my original appeal.  Uh, I was, I
was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on
that basis of, of, you know, you've arrived, you've got this card --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and, uh, you know, it got to what, fifty-five dollars a year or
something like that, and --

B.22:  Oh, dear.

A.23:  -- my wife said, well, this is ridiculous, why are we doing this.

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  And, uh, so we stopped doing it, and we refused to pay, I don't know
whether you know this --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- but my wife discovered this, we started to refuse to pay our banks an
annual fee for the that, for the Visa and Mastercard [laughter] --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- and they said, fine, we'll give it to you anyway.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And we said, you know --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- we're, uh, we're not interested in your card any more.  And they said,
well, wait a minute, is it the price?

B.34:  Yeah, uh-huh. 

A.35:  And we said yeah.  So well, we won't charge you any more [laughter].

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  You know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year, or something
like that, twelve dollars --

B.38:  Yeah.

A.39:  -- something like that.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  So.  They're wonderful.  I mean, I think credit cards are great.  We use it
to get cash, uh, you know, you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San
Francisco and --

B.42:  Um.

A.43:  -- it's wonderful in that respect, and we're glad to have them.  We, we,

B.44:  Can, can you buy groceries with it?

A.45:  Yeah.

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  It's great, #you know# --

B.48:  #Yeah.#

A.49:  -- and it, eventually what we're going to go to is nothing but these kinds
of cards --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- and it'll be Mastercard, Visa, and, and American Express.  I don't think
the Discover card's going to make it in the long term.

B.52:  Uh-huh.

A.53:  Um, you know, we don't need to many cards, and the American Express will
probably survive, but it'll have to become more like these other ones and
become cheaper, #I think, if the price will come down.#

B.54:  #Yeah, I think so too.#

A.55:  I don't think it's worth fifty-five bucks a year --

B.56:  No, it's not.

A.57:  -- when you can use the Visa or the Mastercard everywhere in the world, and
they're pitching that in all their commercials, I notice.

B.58:  Yeah, you really can, and, uh, also, uh, we travel abroad some, and, uh,
um, Mastercard's accepted everywhere --

A.59:  Yeah.

B.60:  -- and, and you get the, a, a good rate --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- a better rate than you do cashing in traveler's checks.  Of course, I,

A.63:  Well, that's, that's interesting.  I can see why, because then they get
some sort of advantage in terms of the conversion fee probably.

B.64:  Yeah, and, and even, uh, converting your traveler's checks at a bank, they
still charge you a fee.

A.65:  Right.  

B.66:  #And, uh.#

A.67:  #Well, and it's# going to come that way, and the reason it's nice is
because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your
financial resources anywhere in the world, and that's where we're headed.  The
technology supports that nicely, and, uh, it makes more sense than, than that,
because you have a card, and if you have insurance, which we have had on the
card, you, uh --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- can have, you lose it, stolen, and you don't get, uh, anything charged
to you --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- and that's great.  #It's just insurance.#

B.72:  #Uh-huh,# uh-huh.

A.73:  We're very responsible with our cards, but nonetheless if we lost them --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or
whatever --

B.76:  Yeah.

A.77:  -- uh, on the cards.  We look for the low rate.  We have U S A A cards, you
know, U S A A?

B.78:  Yeah, we do, too [laughter].  

A.79:  Yeah, U S A is Dallas based, and, uh, that's a great thing.
