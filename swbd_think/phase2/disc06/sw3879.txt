A.1:  Uh, this is about the, Vietnam right?

B.2:  The Vietnam war.

@A.3:  Yeah well, uh, guess I'm, I'm twenty-three.  Are you older than I am?

B.4:  Yeah, I am forty-one so was,

A.5:  So you have a better opinion of, of what,

B.6:  Well, I, uh, was in college when the war escalated to it's height and, uh,
I guess my feeling is consistent with that of, uh, the general public.  That it
was an unfortunate event.  Uh, it's real interesting to, uh, think about it in
the context of this new movie J F K which is --

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  -- apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- uh, uh, that apparently the people who worked for Kennedy say he did
decide that he was going to pull out of Vietnam.  He was not going to commit
more troops that, that had nothing to do with the assassination people say, but
they, that he had come to that conclusion.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  I think it was, uh, particularly in light of recent events, a really
unfortunate mistake.  Communism was self destructing even then and, uh, the
history of Vietnam which has been, uh, represented in a number of different
commentaries and documentaries, one on the public broadcasting system.  Uh, it
seems that it just didn't have to happen and I think its a valuable, uh, if
painful lesson for this country.

A.13:  Yeah, I mean look back now, know what we know now --

B.14:  Right.

A.15:  -- I mean it's just a complete disaster.

B.16:  At the time, I wasn't that, uh, wasn't that sure.  I, I, really didn't know
enough about it and wasn't that politically active.  Uh, but it was, uh,
apparently something that could have been avoided.  And, I, you know, I think
I look at wars generally as falling into that category, uh, people are
beginning to wonder whether or not the, uh, Gulf War could have been avoided
even though that was a --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- remarkably painless war, as wars go.

A.19:  Well, I just think that the Gulf War was just something that was really,
uh, I don't know it's, I kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a
way, because I mean basically what is spent, how many billions of dollars --

B.20:  Right.

A.21:  -- just beat up on it.

B.22:  Third World Country, really.

A.23:  Inferior, yeah inferior army that was just, wanting to quit and didn't have
any food and I mean, it's just I don't know how much pride one can really take
in that.

B.24:  Well, I think what, what's, uh, I, I guess I would use the word relevant to
the Vietnam war, the question is that the Vietnam war was apparently avoidable
too.  It was a time when Ho Chi Minh apparently came to the United States and
said look, if you are willing to provide me with support, all I want to do is
unify Vietnam --

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- and, uh, he was turned away by Truman.  Uh, so it's, uh, a painful
lesson.  I guess one that we are beginning to learn.  I'm really impressed by
how much effects some of these movies have had on public consciousness.  The J
F K movie is ca-, causing one person after another to, uh, call for the release
of the documents that have been sealed.

A.27:  Oh, yeah. That's just, uh, 

B.28:  Did you see any of the Vietnam Wars?  Uh, any of the Vietnam war movies?

A.29:  I've seen, uh, you know, APOCOLYPSE NOW and, uh, what was the one with, uh,
Christopher Waken and, uh --

B.30:  Oh, THE DEER HUNTER.

A.31:  -- THE DEER HUNTER --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- yap and, you know, and just a lot of other I guess inferior ones made,
but I mean --

B.34:  Those two, yeah.

A.35:  -- sorry, I think APOCOLYPSE NOW and, uh, THE DEER HUNTER just (( ))
movies, you know --

B.36:  Yeah they were, they,

A.37:  -- THE DEER HUNTER is a little bit more of an incident but,

B.38:  Yeah.  Well, they were both remarkable films.  As a matter of fact, there
is a new film out about the Vietnam War, about the making of APOCOLYPSE NOW
which its self is suppose to be great,

A.39:  Yeah, HEART OF DARKNESS.

B.40:  Yeah.

A.41:  Yeah, I've seen that.

B.42:  Have you?  Is it good?

A.43:  Uh, it's great.  I had it on Showtime, uh, before they released it to
theaters.  In fact, right this summer, and, uh, it's really something.  It's
almost, it just as entertaining if not more entertaining than the film is
because,

B.44:  That's what people say.  I am really looking forward to seeing it.  His
wife apparently made it.  From documentary,

A.45:  Right.  She just shot documentary, you know, had like a little hand held
camera and you know, the whole thing has been edited together, but when Martin
Sheen had his heart attack.  It's just amazing what #you know Frances is, is,#

B.46:  #Oh, is that# on the film?  Could that be captured on film?

A.47:  Yeah.  It doesn't capture the actual thing.  It captures him getting, uh,
some treatment after it happened, but that she had an, uh, tape recorder
running when he was talking on the phone about it.  He's just really freaking
out, I mean, about he's more concerned about the, you know, how confus-, the
whole time when it was being made, uh, I was just a kid back then, but, I guess
it's just people back in America just want to hear about it.  How it was just
such a disaster.  This is like the last thing he needed was for Marty to have
a heart attack.

B.48:  Right, right, right.

A.49:  Uh, you'll, you'll love it.  I mean it's it's really great.  

B.50:  Yeah, well, I, well the thing I think is really neat about,
