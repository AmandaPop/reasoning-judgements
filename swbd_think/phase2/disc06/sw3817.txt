A.1:  Planned a family reunion recently?

@B.2:  The last family reunion, I did not plan.  I only participated and enjoyed,
about two years ago.  How about you?

A.3:  You know, I really haven't and I know of friends who've done it recently
and have really enjoyed, uh, the, the planning process but, uh, most of our
family see each other fairly frequently so it's, it's, uh, you know, not a, a
major event to, to try and plan it because [laughter] we're all fairly close.
Uh,

B.4:  It often depends on how far you want to go back.  O-, on our particular
family reunion, they went back to my great-great-grandfather so that it was
quite, uh, spread out and there were many families, uh, and there were many
people we didn't know.  I think the total participation, I don't know how many
were invited, but there were about two hundred and fifty people there.

A.5:  That's wonderful.

B.6:  And some of the families, one of the cutest things that some of the, the
families did was to get t-shirts,

A.7:  [Laughter].

B.8:  that identified themselves as that branch of the family.

A.9:  Oh, that's great.

B.10:  It was fun.

A.11:  So your great-grandfather was still living and everyone up to that point
was invited.

B.12:  Actually, he was not.  He has gone [laughter].  But they decided to go
ahead and take the family reunion back that far.  So that it wouldn't just be
people meeting third cousins but people meeting, I guess, whatever --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- sixth and seventh cousins.

A.15:  Wow [noise].

B.16:  And the other thing that I thought was particularly fun was, uh, the huge,
they had a huge family tree, uh, that was posted.  So you could sort of,
everybody could sort of see who married whom and --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- so that was fun.  

A.19:  That's wonderful.  Two hundred people.  Who organized it?  Who was the one
that instigated the, the planning process.

B.20:  You know, in every family, there's usually one person that is gifted to do
these things [laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  I have a cousin who never married.  Who is a librarian.  Sounds like a bad
novel.

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  Uh, and she did.  She was, she's always been interested in genealogy and
she's kind of kept track.

A.25:  I was going to ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was.

B.26:  Uh, I think she just started out writing to key people in the different
branches of families and asking them to contact everyone.

A.27:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.28:  #And I really,# an-, on the family tree, there really was everyone, except
there was just some, one group that had sort of gotten lost in Missouri.  But,
this is, was in Indiana.  And it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in
one area.

A.29:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.30:  So it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country.  But,

A.31:  Now given the size of the group, were there people, were most of the
families fairly large?  Is that what contributed to that?

B.32:  We're a good Catholic German stock.  #And ((so yes)).#

A.33:  #[Laughter].#

B.34:  The original family that I eluded to, my great-grandfather had twelve
children.  And they had some pictures of, that was another thing they did that
I thought was fun.

A.35:  That's #great.#

B.36:  #((Sounds))# like the twelve, {mispronounced} twelve tribes of Israel or
something.

A.37:  That's wonderful.  I'm sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids
too.  And even if they didn't appreciate it at the moment, they'll [laughter]
#probably# --

B.38:  #((Actually))# --

A.39:  -- really appreciate it later.

B.40:  -- they remember most of the games.  They had lots of games,

A.41:  [Clicking].

B.42:  and competitions which were fun.  Well, are you planning a family reunion?

A.43:  No, #uh [lipsmack],# --

B.44:  #No.#

A.45:  -- #uh,# 

B.46:  #Do,# you, how, your rel-, you're from, you're in San Francisco?

A.47:  Yeah.  My folks, uh, moved from Michigan to San Diego and that's where they
raised the three of us.  My daughter, my sisters and myself [lipsmack].  But,
uh,

B.48:  Sometimes when you've moved, perhaps your family reunion, if there ever
would one, would be back in Michigan.  #(( )) where your roots would be?#

A.49:  #I would expect.  Yeah, yeah.#  And I know that my grandparents' families
were fairly large.  But my father has just one brother and my mom has one
brother --

B.50:  Um {very faint}.

A.51:  -- so we've kept in touch, those first cousins, very, pretty closely.  Um,
I'm not quite sure how I'd even pursue #finding the rest,#

B.52:  #[Laughter].#

A.53:  of the folks in Michigan.  #I think, I think each# --

B.54:  #This is little off the,# 

A.55:  -- of grandparents had ten siblings.  #So# --

B.56:  #That# sounds #typical (( )) [laughter].#

A.57:  -- #there's got to be a few of those second,# does that make second cousin
or third cousin?  I'm not sure.

B.58:  I never knew that.  #I, I always,#

A.59:  #[Laughter].#

B.60:  I thought the chil-, like the children of your first cousins, I always
called those second cousins and my children and my cousins' children I called
third cousins.

A.61:  Oh, okay.  #Okay.#

B.62:  #That's# how I've always named it.  Some people have this once removed
stuff.  #I don't know what that means.#

A.63:  #So, perhaps, my# grandparents siblings would be my #great-great-aunts and
uncles?#

B.64:  #They'd just be your great-aunts.#  Great-aunts.  Your grandparents'
siblings would be your great-aunts and uncles.

A.65:  Right, right.

B.66:  So.  But it, it is interesting.  Sometimes a little sad when families
branch out quite so much, but I don't know, that's the American way.

A.67:  Did you find that you had a lot in common?  Did people find out things
about each other that they hadn't been aware?

B.68:  I had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area
[laughter] #that I# --

A.69:  #Really.#

B.70:  -- never had met and didn't know they were here.  And we, we all laughed.
How it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived #ten miles
from you.#

A.71:  #[Laughter].#

B.72:  So that was sort of funny.  In fact, one of them, it's like my f-, I don't
know remember how this was, I guess it was actually just my father's cousin,
so it's not all that far away.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  Turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas.
