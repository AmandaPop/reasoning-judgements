=======================================================================

A.1:  What are you cooking for supper?

B.2:  Oh, boy, that's a good question.  I haven't figured that one out yet.
Personally, I'm thinking of making a goulash --

A.3:  That sounds pretty good.

B.4:  -- but I'm publishing a cookbook right now, so, or getting it ready to go
to the publisher.

A.5:  What type of food?

B.6:  All types --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- different nationalities.  There's going to be a different section for
each nationality.  It ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese.
There's some Scot-, there's some Scottish in it, some Scottish dishes that I
know.  Some Russian.  Some for babies, you know, how to make baby food instead
of buying it --

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- because it's so bloody expensive.

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  [Laughter].

A.13:  Well, I'm kind of a house husband, and, and I cook everyday.  That's about
the only thing.

B.14:  I'm a housewife [laughter].

A.15:  Huh?

B.16:  I'm a housewife --

A.17:  Yeah.

B.18:  -- everyday, too --

A.19:  And --

B.20:  -- I've got two little boys.

A.21:  -- today I made a banana cream pie.  My wife gets testy if I don't have
some sort of dessert in the house.

B.22:  [Laughter].

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  Yeah, I made banana bread two days ago, and it's gone.  Everything I make
disappears real quick, so I guess people like it.

A.25:  Yeah, sometimes I, I make things and they don't work, so I kind of throw
them away before anybody sees them.

B.26:  [Laughter].

A.27:  But, I'm a, I, I don't know, I live out of cookbooks, other than stuff that
I've cooked over and over and over.

B.28:  Yeah.  Well, see a lot of people do live by cookbooks, not just house
husbands, but like bachelors and stuff.  They don't know how to cook anything,
you know, unless they have a recipe --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- to follow.  That's why I'm publishing this cookbook, because it's simple
recipes.  It's nothing that's hard.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  It's just, everything in it is really simple.

A.33:  Sometimes I like to get a hold of a very hard book, uh, and hard recipes,
especially some of the French dishes, and where I've got to read it, reread
it, and then keep it out while I'm cooking.

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  And, you know, something new, not something I'm going to fix every day, or
something.

B.36:  Just something for a special occasion.

A.37:  Right.  But I guess, I know for like twenty years I, my wife and I both
been fixing a, a chicken dish from the Philippines, and it's really, really
strong with garlic and black pepper, and we've always thought nobody would
like it,

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  and, uh, we recently served it to some guests we had, and, and, uh, they
all had to have the recipe.

B.40:  [Laughter] Oh, really.

A.41:  Yeah, and #I didn't go easy on# --

B.42:  #That must have made you good.#

A.43:  -- anything.  Yeah, it's, it's delicious.  It's like when it, when it's
like birthday time, and you say, well what do you want to eat, we always say
Chicken Adobo and --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- it's just, it's very pungent thing, and, and we just didn't think
anybody would like it, but they all went nuts about it, and I've already heard
that two of them have already fixed it at home, so.

B.46:  Huh.

A.47:  [Sniffing].

B.48:  Well, my husband went to chef school before we got married, and he can cook
all kinds of fancy dishes, and I can, because I went to cooking school, too,
but I, I favor the Midwestern kind of cooking --

A.49:  Yeah.

B.50:  -- because I grew up country, #so that's what I like.#

A.51:  #Where, did you grow up in the Midwest?#

B.52:  Well, I grew up in Arizona --

A.53:  Okay.

B.54:  -- on a r-, on a ranch.  And it was a horse ranch, and we cooked country
style, you know, I mean, you don't peel your potatoes when you cook them --

A.55:  Right.

B.56:  -- in the country you just cut them up and there you go.

A.57:  Yeah, #think a lot of the,#

B.58:  #[Laughter].#

A.59:  lot of the things that I cook and that my wife cooks, they're, they're from
Midwest, from Iowa, from her background --

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  -- because that's where we picked up the recipes, and we have a lot of
regional cookbooks from that area.  So it's, especially when we're baking
something, boy, we just go to those,

B.62:  [Laughter].

A.63:  little city cookbooks, and we know they've been tried and --

B.64:  Yep.

A.65:  -- tested and, and everything, so.

B.66:  Well, my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad, which was
about ten years ago, but, um, and she published hers, so now it's my turn.
I'm trying my luck [laughter].

A.67:  Uh, we lived in New Mexico, northern New Mexico for eight years and,

B.68:  Anywhere near Alamogordo?

A.69:  Uh, no, we lived up at Los Alamos --

B.70:  Oh.

A.71:  -- so, and then, up in the mountains, but we picked up a lot of, uh, Santa
Fe type dishes --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- and, uh, that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they,
uh, they expect it.

B.74:  There's some really good food that comes out of there, I'll tell you.

A.75:  Yeah.  We don't even like to go out to the Mexican,

B.76:  [Laughter].

A.77:  restaurants [laughter] around here.

B.78:  There is none around here that's really Mexican.  They're all fake --

A.79:  Yeah, well.

B.80:  -- you know and when you taste the food, you know it [laughter].  #There's
just a difference.#

A.81:  #In this part of the world# there's, you know, there's a lot, and there's
some from the interior of Mexico, and --

B.82:  Oh, really.

A.83:  -- country Mexican cooking and things like that, so, you can get into some
unusual things, but I still find that, you know, especially, even when we go
back to Santa Fe, that I'd rather have the food from there.  They just use,

B.84:  [Laughter].

A.85:  more cheese and --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- more beans and,

B.88:  Well, I live in San Diego, and it's right near the border --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- but you'd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here.  They,
knowing how close we are to the border, I mean, you only have to drive five
minutes to get to the border, you'd think that there'd be good Mexican cooking
here,
