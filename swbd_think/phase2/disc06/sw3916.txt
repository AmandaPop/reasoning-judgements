A.1:  (( )) to face the situation where you were looking at putting
a loved one in the nursing home.

@B.2:  Well, I, we're sort of in the middle of it.

A.3:  Really?

B.4:  Uh, last February, we brought my mother from Florida to up
here in Texas and so far she has been with us, but I really look
to the future that it may be occurring, uh, uh --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- I don't know what I will do.  I am almost inclined to hire
somebody.  Uh, to be in our home with her rather than have to put
her somewhere --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- you know but,

A.9:  You don't feel as though that that's a decision you're
comfortable with because #if you,#

B.10:  #Well, I# think partly and it's not me, it's the, it seems
[cough] {someone in background maybe} to me the older generation,
my mother and father and my in-laws, uh, you know, the stigma use
to be you went there and you died and so they have all kind of,

A.11:  You feel as though they are being abandoned --

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  -- if you leave them somewhere.

B.14:  You know I just, uh, and you try and say, they are nice now,
or [noise] or nicer [noise] and you know I wouldn't want her in
one in Florida because I couldn't check on her, but if she were
in one near here --

A.15:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- I, I would probably be there, you know, several times per
week --

A.17:  Sure.

B.18:  -- and I would stand up and scream if I saw things that were,
you know [noise] --

A.19:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- improper or, uh, you know, her care was not [inhaling],

A.21:  It's difficult.  Boy I really #can appreciate,# 

B.22:  #Have you# had that experience yet?

A.23:  No I haven't --

B.24:  Well.

A.25:  -- but, uh, I work in a hospital and --

B.26:  Oh.

A.27:  -- we see patient's whose families are just not able to care
for them once they have left the hospital, so they have to make
that decision --

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  -- often when the patients still in the #hospital.#

B.30:  #It's, uh#, well my father died several years ago and that
was, you know, he had cancer and eventually the hospital [noise]
comes and says you know, your father [talking] uh, you know,
Medicare says he doesn't need the level of care --

A.31:  Uh-huh.

B.32:  -- to be hospitalized so you are going to, eventually they
will come and tell you will have two days [noise] to, you know,
move him somewhere else and that my mother and I needed to, uh,
think #what do we want to do.#

A.33:  #So, then you begin,# 

B.34:  At that point we did --

A.35:  Right.

B.36:  -- because he was not yet comatose, but real close and he
lived two weeks in the nursing home, so we did do that --

A.37:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- but, uh, at that time, three and a half years ago, my
mother was in such a state of depression, I didn't think she
could handle --

A.39:  Yes.

B.40:  -- even if we had full time around the clock care.  I didn't
think emotionally she could handle #him being there.#

A.41:  #Yes, it's a# challenging job physically.

B.42:  Well, it, yes that too, yo-, you know there is no question
that, uh, just moving [noise] {sounds like hammering} them about is
uh, difficult --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- but it really is and it's just, uh, and I have friends who,
we are all in the age group where we are thinking about --

A.45:  Yes.

B.46:  -- some of these things for our parents --

A.47:  Yes.

B.48:  -- and it really is, uh,

A.49:  What are some of the things that you have looked for?  For
example with your father wh-, wh-, helped you identify an
appropriate #placement# --

B.50:  #With# [inhaling],

A.51:  -- was it, was it geographic?  Was it how close it was to you
or [inhaling],

B.52:  Well, of course this again was in Florida.  Actually the
level of care,

A.53:  Oh, that's right.

B.54:  And in fact two that we looked at, you know, they were all in
mauve and blue and very elegant looking and so on, but I didn't
like the fact that they had, you know, eight patients for one, uh,
you know, nurse --

A.55:  Care giver, uh-huh.

B.56:  -- or one care giver and the one we selected was not nearly
as, uh, up to date.  However, it was clean [noise] and the
patients were well cared for and I like to think because it had a
level of five to one --

A.57:  Yes.

B.58:  -- and I felt [noise] that that would be better care for my
father --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- uh, and several of her neighbors and friends oh, but you
ought to, I said I know, but we are making this decision and my
mom basically let me make the decision so --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- uh, and she was pleased with it, because he did get, uh,
you #know just wonderful care.#

A.63:  #That's a pretty important# factor too.  That really
#influences the degree.#

B.64:  #Oh absolutely.  I don't care what, you know# one of these
had a little ice cream parlor and I looked at the manager and I
said my father, you know, will never get out of a bed, I don't
care about an ice cream parlor.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  You know if you went there and you were in your seventies and
well, you just went there to, uh, #you know a retirement center
yes# --

A.67:  #More transitional setting.#

B.68:  -- you could do all that good stuff.

A.69:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.70:   But this was, I wanted him cared for and not left, you know,
if he spoiled his linens or something, I did not want that --

A.71:  Exactly.

B.72:  -- you know, there.  What do you do in a hospital. #Work
with,# 

A.73:  #My job# is a occupational therapist.

B.74:  Okay, all right.

A.75:  Uh, it a lot of what we are looking at are skills that the
person is going to have to be able to perform to be able to live
independently once they leave the hospital and we sometimes help
the family make that decision.  If it looks like they are going
to be able to, uh, get in and out of bed or on and off the toilet
with just a little bit of help that's something that they can
manage, but you are talking about an elderly spouse and when it
involves quite a bit of assistance and lifting --

B.76:  Right.

A.77:  -- you don't want the other person,
