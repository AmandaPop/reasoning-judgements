========================================================================

A.1:  Let's see, um, have you heard anything in particular about the universal
health care sys-, uh, health insurance program that they're talking about?

@B.2:  Well, I haven't heard any of the specific details of, uh, what they have
planned, but, uh, basically the noise around Washington is that, uh, they're
concerned that, uh, there's not enough health care insurance provided, that,
uh, very few families have, uh, health care insurance or any kind of, uh,
coverage where they're employed.

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  Uh, I'm not sure that there's any real plan afoot to, uh, bring a health
care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in, like, uh, Social
Security --

A.5:  Yeah.

B.6:  -- but, uh, one of the plan that's been circulated about is a requirement
that employers provide, uh, health care insurance for their employees and kick
in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance,

A.7:  [Whistling].

B.8:  and, uh, if they don't do that, then they have to pay into a federal fund
that provides the, uh, health care insurance.

A.9:  And it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of --

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  -- the local plan.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  Yeah, #especially for major corporations.#

B.14:  #I tell you one thing that, uh,# we were discussing this evening here, that
discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system, uh, I
know that certainly in this region, uh, that the number of students graduating
from dental school has been quite large --

A.15:  Yeah.

B.16:  -- and a lot of the foreign students that, uh, came and stayed in this
country didn't go back home --

A.17:  Yes.

B.18:  -- so there's been a kind of, dentists are kind of glut on the market, and
they're having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet.

A.19:  Well.

B.20:  And, uh, physicians, I think, may be facing the same situation, except they
apparently have a very strong organization and they are actually preventing
students from entering medical college.

A.21:  Oh, yeah, they keep, uh, the A M A, you've got to go through the A M A to
get accepted into medical school --

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  -- and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  But, uh, now dental school, that's, yeah, if they've got a glut on the
market of dentists, um, I, I, I don't mean to be ugly about it, but, uh, costs
of dental work are pretty high.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  And if there's something, I don't necessarily think it needs to be driven
down again, but to keep it from shooting up.  Of course dentistry I don't
think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such.

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  That's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the
unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And, it seems to be the burden of proof that, on the doctor that he didn't
do something wrong rather than proving that he did, and if he doesn't prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right, then suddenly
he's got, you know, two or three years wages down the toilet, but, uh.

B.32:  I think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries.  I think
our light plane industry went out of business because the, uh, cost of, uh,
manufacturers' product liability was too high.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Uh, but I think on the other side of the coin, that, uh, maybe the A M A
is,

A.35:  #[Throat_clearing].#

B.36:  #being# a little bit too protective --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- of some of their physicians, uh.

A.39:  Yeah, there are physicians getting away with murder.

B.40:  Yeah, I've, I've got my own set of war stories --

A.41:  Yeah.

B.42:  -- uh, my daughter, uh, turns out she's allergic to gnats, and the first
time I went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars.

A.43:  [Gasp]. 

B.44:  And the second,

A.45:  [Cough].

B.46:  time I went to a different doctor,

A.47:  [Cough].

B.48:  and the doctor said oh, she's allergic to gnats, give her some Benadryl.

A.49:  [Cough].

B.50:  That was a two dollar and forty-five cent treatment for it.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  And so, uh, you know, four days in the hospital, the children's ward on I V
penicillin, uh, was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of
Benadryl.

A.53:  Yeah.

B.54:  And I have other friends that, uh, have really been misdiagnosed --

A.55:  Yes.

B.56:  -- and I think it's probably a shame that there isn't more competition
among doctors and there isn't a little more policing --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- uh, of the results.

A.59:  Yeah, uh, from what I've seen, the better physicians are quick to ask you
to go ahead and get a second opinion.

B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  They're not feeling, you know, insulted.  They're, it's like, that's a
little, you know, sweat off my brow simply because, I mean, you know, they're
covering their own tail legally, and, you know, a second opinion,
