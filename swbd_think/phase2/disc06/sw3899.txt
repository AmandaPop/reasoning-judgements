B.1:  Uh-huh.

A.2:  Okay, I pushed it. 

B.3:  Okay.

A.4:  So what do you think, um, we can do to, uh, prevent air pollution?

@B.5:  Well, um, I worry about incineration.  You know, I worry that we-, we're
doing way too much of that.  Although I'm not sure, the one thing that I have
trouble is wood smoke.  Wh-, how, whether that's a very serious one or not.
[noise] Um, you know, uh, 

A.6:  Yeah, well, you know what, I was talking to my brother in Denver and he
told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace.

B.7:  Well, that's what I've heard, it kills me [laughter].  Because I love
fires [laughter].

A.8:  Yeah.  #I couldn't,#

B.9:  #And I,# and I really, really care about pollution and I don't use anything
that's got the, the, the, s-, stu-, the stuff in it, you know, the --

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  -- spray bottles.  And I, uh, try to do everything I can.  But that's the
one thing that I think is very difficult is, is the wood fires.  Because it
seems to me that they were natural.

A.12:  [Lipsmack] Yeah.  #I can't underst-,# 

B.13:  #It's a,# that's a natural process.  And unlike, unlike, you know all of
the rest of it but,

A.14:  Yeah.  I just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict, uh, you
know, like a fireplace.  Because a lot of places that's all th-, all the heat
they have #in,#

B.15:  #That, that,# 

A.16:  their home.

B.17:  that's what they have, yeah.

A.18:  You know.

B.19:  But, um, I, you know, I, I am really concerned about it because you can,
you beginning, well you're beginning to see the air.

A.20:  Well, I know, yeah.  Isn't that #terrible?#

B.21:  #And,# and that's frightening.  And I know in California, uh, a whole lot
is being done.  I don't know how well that's working and if all those things,
all those laws went through about, about the, for the car manufacturers and
everything.  Has that, do you know?

A.22:  Well, I don't know.  All I know is that we have to have our car ou-, our
car smogged #every,#

B.23:  #Yeah.#

A.24:  two years, you know.

B.25:  Uh-huh.

A.26:  And, uh,

B.27:  But I think what they're going to do is try to get the, try to get the
[noise] car manufacturers to make cars that, you know, use gasoline m-, uh,
better and more cleanly #or,#

A.28:  #Uh-huh.#

B.29:  use cleaner fuel.

A.30:  [Breathing] Well, you think that they would be able to do that.  #You
know.#

B.31:  #I think they can do that.#

A.32:  I think they could too, you know,

B.33:  [Laughter].

A.34:  they just, they don't want to.  They want to use, uh, you know, something
that's going to burn all this gas so we can buy more gas.

B.35:  Yes.

A.36:  [Laughter].

B.37:  I think that's right, I think that's right.

A.38:  #You know.#

B.39:  #But it's# scary what it's doing to, to stone buildings, you #know, the#
[noise],

A.40:  #Uh-huh.#

B.41:  the acid rain.

A.42:  #Uh-huh.#

B.43:  #I mean# destroying things.  Trees are dying.  A lot of forests are, are
dying of (( )) are in Canada.  #And, uh,#

A.44:  #Uh-huh.#

B.45:  and, uh, I don't know about, I don't know about in California.

A.46:  Well, I don't know about that either.  But, uh, I know I took a ride down
southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look, you know
like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this crud, you know.

B.47:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.48:  It's, oh, it's terrible.

B.49:  Yeah.  Well I, I had not experienced it as much.  My son went to Pomona and
he went, the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season.
#So,#

A.50:  #Uh-huh.#

B.51:  when he first went out there abo-, you know, abo-, a long time ago four or
five years ago.  #But,#

A.52:  #Uh-huh.#

B.53:  anyway h-, he called and just said, Mother, [laughter] now I know what
they're talking about, I mean,

A.54:  #Yeah.#

B.55:  #this stuff# you really feel you can't breathe.

A.56:  Yeah, i-, it does.  It burns your eyes and everything.  But --

B.57:  Uh-huh.

A.58:  -- a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to, I think they could do
something to those.  Because some of those trucks just smoke like heck, #you
know.#

B.59:  #Yeah,# yeah, yeah.

A.60:  But it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that.

B.61:  No, I know.  And, and as far as what I, you know, I do think about almost
everything else.  But as far as the air is concerned I am trying to buy a new
car but there are no cars available with clean fuel.

A.62:  Uh-huh.

B.63:  So I can't do that.  #Um, I ju-,#

A.64:  #No.#   The electric cars I think that was a good idea.

B.65:  Yeah, yeah.

A.66:  I would really go for that.

B.67:  Yeah, I would too.  But that i-, i-, it's not affordable and it's not #out
there.#

A.68:  #Yeah, right, right.#

B.69:  And then I have stopped using anything b-, but pump sprays.  So that I'm
trying to get, I'm trying not to use that, whatever that's called, clora-,
some kind of hy-, anyway that hu-, that's hurting the ozone --

A.70:  Huh.

B.71:  -- uh, level.  I'm trying not to do that.  

A.72:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.73:  The bad thing I do is wood fires [laughter].

A.74:  Yeah, well, uh, we have a fireplace here to.  I don't burn it every night.
#Usually,#

B.75:  #Oh, no, no.#

A.76:  #I just have mine on the,#

B.77:  #I don't either.#

A.78:  weekends, 

B.79:  #Yes.#

A.80:  #or# when I have company that we're going to be in the house all day.  You
know --

B.81:  Yeah.

A.82:  -- and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going.

B.83:  Yeah.  #But,# 

A.84:  #But,# uh, other than that I don't use mine.

B.85:  No.  And I, I'm not sure, I'm not sure that this is something that air
pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of
the other ones.  Uh, like recycling or,

A.86:  #Yeah. Ri-,# 

B.87:  #even water,# you know, water use or,

A.88:  #Right, right.#

B.89:  #saving water.#  And that's what scary to me.

A.90:  Yeah, I know.  I think it's going to have to be these large companies and,

B.91:  Large companies, #that's right.#

A.92:  #Uh-huh.#

B.93:  Industry and the car manufacturers.

A.94:  Right, right, right.  So,

B.95:  And, uh, that we have less control, I guess it depends on who we vote for
and how we write you know write letters to them,
