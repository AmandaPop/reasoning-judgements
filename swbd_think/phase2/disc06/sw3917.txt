========================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  Uh, do you want to go ahead or,

B.2:  Oh, sure.  Uh, [lipsmack] well [laughter].  I, uh, went to school at
Madison for two years and they are really big on women's rights.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  And, and equal treatment.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And so I, I've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that.  But, uh,
I'm not that liberated.  I mean my mom is kind of old-fashioned, #you know.#

A.7:  #Uh-huh.#

B.8:  So, I, you know, you pick up some traits from her and stuff.  But, uh, I
think it's, I think it's interesting and better for women to see that there's
more, more of them doing men's fields.  I like to see that.  #And# --

A.9:  #Right.#

B.10:  -- I don't like to see women, you know, like waiting on men hand and foot
but, you know, I, I believe in like sharing and doing things for each other.

A.11:  I do too.  I like the idea.  I see a lot more, uh, my children, I have five
children and they're all married.

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  And, uh, I love seeing the men help the women #so much.#

B.14:  #Right.#

A.15:  And they both cooperate together on, I think it's great.

B.16:  Oh, me too [laughter].  I hope that happens to me someday.  #I mean, I, I
don't mind# --

A.17:  #(( )) [laughter].#

B.18:  -- doing stuff.  Uh, I have a boyfriend and I got to make him dinner and
stuff but, you know, I, he'll help me do the dishes.  I don't want to, you
know --

A.19:  Right.

B.20:  -- expect to help to clean up then #after (( )) [laughter].  Yeah.#

A.21:  #That's right.#  That's right.

B.22:  Yeah.  #So [laughter].#

A.23:  #I've# always taught my men that.  They better clean up with their women
and help them.  If they did that, you know.

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  And they're, they're good about it.  But it is neat to see them all work
together.  #And# --

B.26:  #Uh-huh.#

A.27:  -- a big thing that I see.  All that, most of the, most of the women
getting married now, uh, go back, have gone back to, you know, they, they stay
at work or go back to work.  #Or whatever.#

B.28:  #Right.#

A.29:  And they're well educated.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And I believe we'll see a lot more C E O -s in companies.  They're having a
fit about how little there are.

B.32:  Oh.

A.33:  And I think we'll see a lot more.  Don't you?  Of upper management?  

B.34:  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.35:  [Swallowing] Then we do now, even.  

B.36:  Right.

A.37:  I think it'll escalate.

B.38:  Yeah.  

A.39:  And, uh, and I think black women now i-, in fact I work at a high school.

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  And my boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and
already promoted and she's very sharp.  And I think that th-, and the ethnic
thing will be, you know, is a good thing now.

B.42:  Oh, me too.

A.43:  They're moving them up and they're sharp and they, so you're going to see a
lot, a lot more of that in leadership I believe.

B.44:  Yeah.  I like to see that.  I [clicking] think it's, uh, really neat to see
and all that educated minority, uh, #person# --

A.45:  #Uh-huh.#

B.46:  -- who really knows what they're talking about.  And --

A.47:  Right.

B.48:  -- it's just too bad that some people, you know, still look down on them
just because of their color.  You know.

A.49:  Right.  That's #((a shame)).#

B.50:  #Especially# black women.

A.51:  Yes.

B.52:  So.

A.53:  Yeah.  But they ((wouldn't)) know what they're doing.

B.54:  Right.

A.55:  But I'm not big on subserving as far as #[laughter]# --

B.56:  #Uh-huh.#

A.57:  -- to the men at all.

B.58:  #Right.#

A.59:  #But I# never have gone along with that, you know.  Even far back.  But I
was brought up pretty good in a home that, years ago my mother was that way.
The same.  I, my bo-, ther-, you know, some people say oh the boys shouldn't
have to do those jobs.  The inside jobs.  But we never were taught, they had
to do as much as we did.  So #that was good.#

B.60:  #Right, same here.#  Yeah.

A.61:  So that's, I think that's good.  To keep the equal as far as, as, uh, not,
nex-, nex-, uh, necessarily by sex type thing.

B.62:  Right.  #Same here.#

A.63:  #You know.# You should be able to accomplish as much.  And I think the, uh,
attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now.

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  You see a lot more of the mothers and all saying to the young girls, #you
know# --

B.66:  #Yeah.#

A.67:  -- you can do it.  #If he# --

B.68:  #Yeah.#

A.69:  -- can do it, you can do it type thing.

B.70:  Exactly.  I, I see more men, uh, like participating in like the family
things with children.

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  Like, you know, helping to take care of them more.  And --

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  -- and, uh, uh, doing the jobs equally, you know,

A.75:  Right.  What about politics on it?

B.76:  Oh.

A.77:  Do you think the political scene?

B.78:  I'm [laughter] not that big on politics.  I'm not [laughter] --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- that educated on it.  I'm,

A.81:  I'm real dis-, I'm kind of disgusted this year because I don't see many
women into the political scene and I really think we should have more --

B.82:  Oh, yeah.  I agree with that.  

A.83:  -- political leaders in the women than we do up for, and even for President
and Vice President this year, there's nobody again.  I think they're all
scared out after tha-, [laughter] after, uh, [swallowing] oh, what was the
lady's name that ran a couple of, Fitz-, I forget her name now.

B.84:  Oh, #I don't know [static].#

A.85:  #But you know# who I mean?

B.86:  Yeah, I know who you're talking #about.#

A.87:  #Yeah.#  She took such a rough go of it.  And they t-, their tax deal and,

B.88:  Yeah.  At least she was strong to like try it and #you know.#

A.89:  #Right.#  Right.

B.90:  #So that's good.#

A.91:  #But I wish# they would get some more on that.  I really was disappointed
this year when I see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about.
Uh, [lipsmack] they, I didn't see any of the women in there.

B.92:  Uh-huh.

A.93:  And that disappoints me.  

B.94:  Oh.

A.95:  And right now I don't think we have too many.  Uh, th-, in the forefront.
Schroeder's about the biggest one in Washington.

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  Congress woman.  And, uh, other th-, uh, we really,
