============================================================================

A.1:  Wendy, what's the last movie you saw?

B.2:  The last movie I saw in a theater was HOOK. 

A.3:  HOOK.  

B.4:  And, uh, it was very enjoyable.  Uh, I am trying to think.  There's a lot
of movies I want to see.

A.5:  Oh, yeah.  There seems to be a lot out, especially around Christmas, but we
were kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them.

B.6:  But it, but what the last one you saw?

A.7:  Uh, the last one I went to the theater to see was uh, THE DOCTORS.

B.8:  Huh.

A.9:  And I thought that was real good, but I rent movies all the time.

B.10:  Yeah, we do too.

A.11:  Yeah, the last, that seems to be the way we do it any more.  I saw DYING
YOUNG over the weekend.  And,

B.12:  Is that good?  That's with, uh, I am trying to think who's in that.

A.13:  Uh, what's her name.  Julia Roberts.

B.14:  Oh, okay. Okay.

A.15:  And, uh, it was just really good.  I knew it was going to be sad and I knew
somebody was going to be dying.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  But, it was, is still has an interesting plot twist to it.

B.18:  Uh, we want to go see J F K.

A.19:  Yeah.  Trying to,  

B.20:  I mean, I have heard lots of reviews and stuff, but I still want to see it.
Just to,

A.21:  I have been putting off to go see that one, but my wife wants to see it
too.

B.22:  And, uh,  

A.23:  It just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater.  

B.24:  Yeah, it is.  And Plano has grown so much that, uh, the restaurants and
stuff are all so crowded now.  You use to be able to get out to get a quick
bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  So, we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and I think
probably the last rented movie I saw, well no, I take that back it wasn't
rented.  I think it was just on H B O at my in-laws house or something, but
it was HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER.

A.27:  Oh, yeah.  I,

B.28:  And, I love that movie [laughter].

A.29:  Yeah, I went to the theater to see that one.

B.30:  Yeah.  Oh, #that would have been a good one.#

A.31:  #And then, I rented it,# I think, when it came out too.

B.32:  That would have been a good one to see.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Yeah, but renting them just doesn't do them justice sometimes.

A.35:  Sometimes, you're right, it doesn't, uh, but it beats watching what ever is
on television.

B.36:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean I think like uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES just you
know would be a good movie on television, but it, you know, the scenery and
everything --

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  -- was so beautiful on the screen.

A.39:  We had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the
things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of
the GODFATHER movies.

B.40:  Oh, really.

A.41:  So, we did that.  And [laughter] --

B.42:  All of them?  Did you get,

A.43:  -- it was, uh, you know like fourteen hours of GODFATHER stuff [noise].

B.44:  Oh. In one night?

A.45:  No, it took us about three days.

B.46:  [Laughter]  Okay.  I was going to say, that's a long #movie.#

A.47:  #Yeah.# Well, it was still lots.  I'm telling you when that that the last
hour, you know, uh, number three.  We felt like we were Italians, we were
eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to
stop.

B.48:  How many are there?

A.49:  There's three.

B.50:  Three, okay.

A.51:  Yeah, it's almost #something around# --

B.52:  #Well, that's not as bad as,# --

A.53:  -- fourteen hours.

B.54:  -- as, uh, FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH [laughter],

A.55:  [Laughter].

B.56:  or PLANET OF THE APES [laughter]  or (( )).

A.57:  I think my favorite though are old movies [inhaling].

B.58:  Yeah.

A.59:  Black and white.  Uh, I like the old prison movies.  In the thirties and
things like that.  It's just, I don't know.  There's just something about
them.  I think it reminds me of my childhood.

B.60:  Really.

A.61:  Not really {sounds like}.  I just remember when I was little in the summer,
we got to stay up all night and that's what was on.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.63:  So somehow it reminds me again with all my bother's and sister's and, you
know, making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and
stuff.

B.64:  We went through a stage where we rented a lot of the uh, Alfred Hitchcock
the, you know, like NORTH BY NORTHWEST and REAR WINDOW and all those and those
are really good, I mean --

A.65:  Yeah.

B.66:  -- you know, the old black and whites and,

A.67:  I watched, uh, Doris Day Retrospective on C B S the other night.  A thing
about her and different movies she'd been in and I realized how much I missed
the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies.

B.68:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

A.69:  They were just always, I can remember never missing one at the theater.

B.70:  Um.

A.71:  And, cause, they were like sanity --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and, and they were an escape from the real world I think --

B.74:  Yeah.

A.75:  -- and even if I see one on now or somewhere, I will want to watch it so,

B.76:  Oh there, those are some movies.  And they come on, uh, every now and then.
Are you still there?

A.77:  Yeah, I am #still here.#

B.78:  #Okay, it got real quiet.# #I didn't know.  There was no static or
anything, I thought, oh, I thought I'd lost you.#

A.79:  #Yeah, I was just kind of, [laughter] I am in a rest area and I was just
kind of looking someone went by there.#

B.80:  So you are headed up to Tennessee.

A.81:  Yeah, uh, to Tennessee.  It's my mother's eighty fifth birthday.

B.82:  Whereabouts?

A.83:  Kingsport.

B.84:  Oh, okay.  #That's right.# 

A.85:  #You know where that is?#

B.86:  Yeah.  Uh, I work for T I.  And I have traveled to Johnson City #before
and,# 

A.87:  #Oh, yeah.#  Are they still there?

B.88:  Uh, most of it was sold off to FINA, but there is still about five hundred
employees --

A.89:  Yeah.

B.90:  -- that work, that are T I.

A.91:  Yeah, I remember back when they first open in the early seventies there.  I
worked at UNIVAC.

B.92:  Oh.

A.93:  And, uh, just down the road and boy, all the, everybody just,
