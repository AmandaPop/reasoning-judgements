A.1:  You have pets?

@B.2:  Yes, I have one Chihuahua that is fourteen years old.

A.3:  Wow.

B.4:  Do you?

A.5:  I have two cats.

B.6:  Oh, uh-huh.  There has been a time when we had as many as like four pets
when our children were growing up and everything, you know --

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  -- but they died off one by one.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  #And they,# 

A.11:  #I bet you're# attached to your chihuahua.

B.12:  Yeah, yeah.  Cause they're just they are kind of like a baby, you know.
#They're# --

A.13:  #Yeah.#  They are so little and cute.

B.14:  -- you have to carry them around you know.  They can't do a lot
[laughter].

A.15:  Yeah, they are so little and cute [laughter].

B.16:  Right.  Uh, but well our cat died two years ago and she was eighteen years
old.  Well I am telling you this because --

A.17:  Wow.

B.18:  -- you have cats [laughter].

A.19:  Yeah, #eighteen.#

B.20:  #So she# lived a long time.

A.21:  Was it an inside or outside cat?

B.22:  Well, uh, kind of both. Uh --

A.23:  That's what mine are.

B.24:  -- she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a
little door, you know --

A.25:   Uh-huh.

B.26:  -- where she could come in.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  But, then as she got real old, then she went out less and less.

A.29:  Right.

B.30:  And then not at all, you know --

A.31:  Right.

B.32:  -- the last year or so.

A.33:  Right.

B.34:  So, uh,

A.35:  Huh.  Yeah, mine are two characters.  #They're only,#

B.36:  #What do your cats# look like?

A.37:  Oh, I have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly and I have one
that is, uh, uh, yellow and white long hair --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it is the funniest
looking thing you have ever seen.

B.40:  Oh, yeah.  You you to have him skinned.  I mean,

A.41:  His fur shaved, because he, he mats up so bad.

B.42:  Oh. 

A.43:  And he doesn't lick his coat --

B.44:  [Laughter]  He doesn't?

A.45:  -- and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when
you go pick him up, he looks so funny.

B.46:  [Laughter].

A.47:  He looks like a cat going out for aerobics [laughter].

B.48:  Oh, my goodness [laughter].

A.49:  Cause they don't shave, you know, their legs.

B.50:  Oh yeah.  I don't think I have ever seen a cat -- 

A.51:  No, it's real strange.

B.52:  -- sheared like that.

A.53:  They call it a lion cut.  They shave it all the way to the collar.  It is
really funny.  He is real friendly.  He acts like a dog.

B.54:  Oh, my.  I bet.

A.55:  Yeah [laughter].

B.56:  [Laughter]  Do your cats get along well?

A.57:  No, they don't like each other at all [laughter].

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  They really don't.  That is really strange [laughter].

B.60:  Now we do a lot, uh, we, our daughters are like in their late twenties --

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  -- and one of them has a Shelby --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and uh, so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever
all kinds of reasons, her dog is here a lot.

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  [Laughter]  You know.

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  And, uh, its a very pretty dog, you know. 

A.69:  Right.

B.70:  Looks like a little miniature collie.

A.71:  Oh, really?

B.72:  Uh-huh.  That, looks just like Lassie, except in miniature [laughter].

A.73:  Oh, neat. 

B.74:  But, uh, it is a real pretty little dog, but, uh, I don't know if all of
them are that way or not.  Its a real shy dog.  It really only likes like my
daughter and us --

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  -- you know.  And, uh, otherwise, it will go hide [laughter].

A.77:  [Laughter] Well that is what my cats do when company comes.  They hide.

B.78:  Yeah.  Well, uh I, uh, now cats it is more usual I think to do that --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- I don't think I have ever known a dog that would jus-, I mean she is so
#shy# --

A.81:  #Shy.#

B.82:  -- that my daughter's roommate, uh, what roommates she has had and all, if
the dog comes out and sees it is not my daughter, she goes back under the bed.
She wont's even come out [laughter].

A.83:  Oh, my word.  That is shy [laughter].

B.84:  That is why we have to keep her so much because she won't come out for
anybody else.

A.85:  Wow.

B.86:  [Laughter].

A.87:  Your, your dog and your daughter's dog get along?

B.88:  Yeah, yeah.  They don't, uh, uh, --

A.89:  Get in each other's way.

B.90:  -- I mean, they know each other and all that, but they, I mean, they don't
play or anything --

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  -- but my chihuahua is older.  She doesn't care any thing about playing.
We have promised her that sh-, we are not going to get any more pets until she
is gone --

A.93:  Yeah.

B.94:  -- She is going to be an only child.

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  Because, uh, when we got her, she was like one of four pets.

A.97:  Yeah.  And now this is her time.

B.98:  Right.

A.99:  Well, those are so cute.  I just adore them.

B.100:  Yeah, well, of course this one,

A.101:  Do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff?

B.102:  Oh, yeah.  Trying to make a long story short.  We stopped at a service
station several months ago and then when we got home I said, well you get the
dog, I will get the baby.  I had the grandchild in the --

A.103:  Uh-huh.

B.104:  -- back seat.  No dog.  The dog had hopped out at the service station to go
to the bathroom and, uh, we didn't know it until we got home.

A.105:  [Gasp].

B.106:  And I mean, you talk about somebody being frantic and upset, and it took us
three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody --

A.107:  Oh, my word.

B.108:  -- and handing out posters and, with pictures of #the dog.#

A.109:  #How did you find# it?

B.110:  Well, somebody looked at the picture on the poster, well not poster, I

A.111:  Yeah.
