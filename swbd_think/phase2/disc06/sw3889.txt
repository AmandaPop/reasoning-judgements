REMARKS:        Radio in the background of B.  Speaker A's phone was
acting up a couple of times and making a strange noise.

============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, well, have you had to return anything lately?  

B.2:  Well, yes, I did.  I returned [laughter] a number of things yesterday at,
uh, J C Penney.

A.3:  Uh oh.

B.4:  But it wasn't, um, it was clothing.  

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  And, um, the blouse was, uh, supposed to be a size six but the shoulder
drooped over my shoulder [laughter] and it wasn't, you know, the style of the
blouse it just, I think it was sized wrong.  But, you know, it was a nice
blouse, but, and, um, I took some, uh, lingerie back that wasn't, well, I, the
size that I usually buy did not fit in their, in their brand.

A.7:  Huh.  

B.8:  It was too small.  Uh, but as far as large items goes like appliances or
things like that, no.

A.9:  Yeah, we haven't had to take anything back.  Although, I wonder, you know,
if they, sometimes I think things are made to not [laughter] last as long as
they used to.  You know, so you have to buy them more often.  [noise] Uh,
[lipsmack] and my phone is making a weird noise.  Uh, I'm trying to think.
We have, we just moved into our house about two years ago and [noise] --

B.10:  Uh-huh.    

A.11:  -- we had to buy, um, refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that,

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.13:  #and# so far we haven't had any, any major problems, haven't had, although
I keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about
to [laughter] to, uh, you know.

B.14:  Well, uh, I would like to comment on my washer.  Um, [lipsmack] uh, my
washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise.

A.15:  Oh, uh-huh.  

B.16:  And you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced, but, um, it was
doing it quite frequently and so I had a repairman come out and look at it and
he said, well, you need this and so done to this machine.  And I said, oh,
really.  And I, he says let me show you and I sai-, I said, oh, yeah, I see
that it really needs something bad, you know, but it didn't, uh, have an
affect on the performance of the machine.

A.17:  Huh.  

B.18:  What, what, it was the, um, it was a cap after your, um, after the body of
the machine was in place --

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  -- it was under that, so it wasn't visible.  

A.21:  Oh.  

B.22:  And it was out of sight.  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  And it was rusting out.  

A.25:  Huh.  

B.26:  Although I don't have any rust in my clothes and I said, okay, how much do
you want to, uh, do this repair work.  And he told me almost two hundred and
fifty dollars.

A.27:  Oh.  

B.28:  And I said, hey, I can go buy a new one for that price.  

A.29:  [Lipsmack]  Wow.  

B.30:  And I sa-, and I said, no, I'm not going to do that.  I said the
performance of the machine is not affected by that part.  And I said, and
that's not, that's not the cause of the imbalance.  I said I just have to be
more careful how I put my clothes in.  And, um, so that was two years ago and
my machine is still functioning fine.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  [Laughter]. 

A.33:  [Laughter]. 

B.34:  So I didn't, you know, 

A.35:  [Sniffing]. 

B.36:  and he wanted thirty-five dollars for a service call and I says, hey, wait
a minute.  They didn't tell me that when I called, and I said I'm not paying
it.

A.37:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.38:  #I says# if they had told me up front, I would have paid it, but since they
did not say, ma'am, there's a thirty-five dollar service call.  But they
didn't.  And I says, I refuse to pay it, and so he, he had called his office
and told them what I said and I, I was released from that service charge.

A.39:  Huh.  #((Wow what a)),#

B.40:  #So, you know, they were,# they, to me that was underhanded. 

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  I wouldn't have minded if they had said, okay, uh, we have, that service is
thirty-five dollars or whatever they, they charge.  Maybe it's different, um,
um, charges for different things I don't know.

A.43:  Uh-huh. 

B.44:  But it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything.

A.45:  Right [lipsmack].

B.46:  And then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've
got wrong with your, your item.

A.47:  Oh, they could make lots of bucks that way [laughter]. 

B.48:  Yeah, they really could.  

A.49:  Oh.  We haven't had any, we haven't had to have anything fixed like that.
Although, we do, my husband orders a lot from ((Lands End)),

B.50:  #Yes.# 

A.51:  #um,# catalog.  

B.52:  Oh, they are a fantastic company #to deal with.#

A.53:  #Yeah, yeah.# We've, we've had real good luck with them for the most part
but they have changed their sizing somewhat,

B.54:  #Oh, uh-huh.# 

A.55:  #and# because I had ordered a women's blouse and I wear about a six, but I
usually like to order the next size up.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  And I had ordered a, um, uh, one of those little polo shirts. 

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  Uh, and it's really pretty small and I hardly ever wear it.  But, so I was
trying to decide what size to order this time and I went ahead and ordered the
same size and it is like two sizes [laughter] larger.  I mean,

B.60:  #Oh, my.# 

A.61:  #it's, I love it# because it, you know now they make things a little bit
bigger to where they are not as fitted.  You know, but my husband ordered, oh,
he orders pants, dress shirts,
