========================================================================

A.1:  So you have a child -- 

B.2:  Yeah we,

A.3:  -- two years old in child care right now.  

B.4:  Two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of
searching for child care and --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- uh, finding what we consider to be,

A.7:  [Squeak] [door]. 

B.8:  real good child care at a, uh, pretty reasonable price, we think.

A.9:  Uh,

B.10:  How about you, do you have any children?  

A.11:  Yes, our first and he just turned three months.  

B.12:  Oh, boy.  

A.13:  So, we're [noise] just starting into hunting for child [noise] care.

B.14:  Yeah.  

A.15:  Right now, both of us are students.  

B.16:  Are you?  Where are --

A.17:  Uh,

B.18:  -- a student?  

A.19:  Uh, University of Southern Mississippi.  

B.20:  No kidding.  

A.21:  Uh, she's,

B.22:  I was a professor in a university here in California for a while.

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  Yeah, uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or
two?

A.25:  Uh, probably.  Uh, actually spring semester a year from now he's going to
have to be in child care f-, uh, five days a week more than likely.

B.26:  Yeah.  

A.27:  Uh, depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing
her internship that semester.

B.28:  Uh-huh.  

A.29:  It will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing.

B.30:  Yeah.  

A.31:  [Inhaling] So [breathing], depending on what my class schedule looks
like, he may spend four, si-, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child
care at that point.  Right now we're trying to avoid it, but we just, as a
matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him.  Uh,
[breathing] I get out of class at certain time and my wife is already
supposed to be on her way to her class.  You know, once a day this overlap
happens where we can't, one of us --

B.32:  Yeah.  

A.33:  -- be home.  

B.34:  Yeah.  

A.35:  So for about twenty min-, twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter
comes in.

B.36:  Well, that's a good experience, I think, and, uh, [throat_clearing] there
are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the
topic,

A.37:  [Thumping].

B.38:  are pretty good and they kind of boil down to, uh, any other important
decision you really have to explore the alternative --

A.39:  Uh-huh {faint}.

B.40:  -- and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about,

A.41:  [Clinking].

B.42:  people who were going to be loving -- 

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- and, uh, [throat_clearing] that's more important than anything else.  We
could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  Uh, she goes to a home.  This is a, uh,

A.47:  [Clinking].

B.48:  a couple, uh, emigrated from China early --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- in, in their lives.  They've been here probably thirty, forty years.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  They've got three daughters.  Uh, and,

A.53:  [Child_yelling]. 

B.54:  they have a loving home and, uh, they're both there and they have a kid
that comes in and helps them in the afternoon.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  And our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going --

A.57:  Yeah.  

B.58:  -- to see her friends, so -- 

A.59:  Uh, that makes a big difference. 

B.60:  -- it's a good experience.  I th-, if it's good, I think it's very good for
the child.

A.61:  Yes.  

B.62:  And if it's,

A.63:  [Child_crying].

B.64:  a loving environment, I think it's very good and, and that's really what
we've learned about it.  She'll have to go on to something more stimulating in
terms of preschool in a year --

A.65:  Yeah.  

B.66:  -- but, uh, we feel real fortunate and we were able to, uh, just, uh,
choose in the marketplace.  I don't know what it's like around, uh,
Hattiesburg.

A.67:  There's a lot of child care available, but -- 

B.68:  Uh-huh.  

A.69:  -- invariably there's waiting lists.  

B.70:  Yeah.  

A.71:  And we were a little slow getting on the waiting list -- 

B.72:  Yeah.  

A.73:  -- with the, uh, okay, the university, uh, university's, uh --

B.74:  I'll bet they're involved.  

A.75:  -- uh, department of, uh, uh, their Home Ec Department -- 

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  -- uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, American Family Counseling and
their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus.
But, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list.

B.78:  Yeah [screeching]. 

A.79:  So,

B.80:  Well, that's, uh, I know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for
people in, in, uh, university communities.

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  Out here at Manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility and
there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that.

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  So it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important,

A.85:  [Talking].

B.86:  decision, it's an industry that's still a cottage industry --

A.87:  Yeah.  

B.88:  -- and I think this is #b-, really# --

A.89:  #Well, it's best,# 

B.90:  -- is buyer beware.  

A.91:  Yeah, a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,

B.92:  #Well, it is the best way# --

A.93:  #because if you over,# 

B.94:  -- to do it, interestingly.  I think that, uh, my own interest in, in
development, human development --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that, uh, private
enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a --

A.97:  Yeah.

B.98:  -- fundamental change in the way we learn.  

A.99:  [Clinking] Yeah.  

B.100:  Because, I think what we're going to go to is much more commercial
entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market.  As a matter of fact, my
future is banked on that, uh, professionally because I believe that, that
there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, 
colleges --

A.101:  Uh-huh.  

B.102:  -- universities for, uh, learning a lot of things that kids can learn
watching Sesame Street and in child care.

A.103:  [Noise].

B.104:  Primary skills which turn out --

A.105:  Yes.

B.106:  -- to be the most important skills in life.  

A.107:  And it's amazing how much good things like, uh, Sesame Street will do.

B.108:  It's, it's phenomenal.  

A.109:  (( )).

B.110:  It's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,
