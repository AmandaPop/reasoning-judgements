A.1:  [Laughter]. 

B.2:  [Laughter].

A.3:  Never did.  Worked for a lot of computer companies in my life, but not
that, not T I.

B.4:  Um.  Okay.  

A.5:  #Uh.#

B.6:  #Um.# subject is credit cards --

A.7:  Credit cards.

B.8:  -- and how we use them.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  Okay.

A.11:  Sounds like a good.  You ready to get started?

B.12:  I guess so.

A.13:  Okay [beep].

B.14:  Now what's been your experience with credit cards?

@A.15:  I stay away from them [laughter].

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  [Laughter]  No.  Uh, I keep two, I keep, uh, I got a Visa, and it keeps a
little balance on it, not much, and American Express is the one I use
predominantly.  So I know I have to pay it every month.

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  I know when I was younger, twenty years ago or so, I, I got into quite a
bit of hassle with them, charging to the limit, like to never caught them up.

B.20:  Well, I, I, uh, I belonged to American Express many years ago, and, uh,
they had a reputation, or at least they touted, that, uh, don't go, don't
leave home without it type attitude, that it was good in Europe and
everywhere, and I went on travel in Europe, and I was just absolutely appalled
at, uh, the, they, it was useless.

A.21:  Yeah.

B.22:  And, uh, I think, uh, being overseas for about five weeks, there was three
occasions I got to use the card.  Uh, one little hotel out in the middle of
nowhere in Scotland, one little restaurant in Denmark, and things like that --

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- and, uh, later I, uh, well I get in a scrap with, uh, American Express
because they made some mistakes in my account, and it just took too many
letters to get it straightened out.

A.25:  I've had, oh, one time I had an erroneous charge show up on it from some
credit card protection company or something, and that took me a few months to
get that reimbursed and --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- find out what was going on there.  They had authorized, they had paid
somebody without my authorization, and --

B.28:  Well, it.

A.29:  -- and the final letter was they were sorry that happened [laughter].

B.30:  Yeah.  Well, it was something, I don't remember the exact details, so long
ago, uh, they tried to sell me some kind of a special card, you know, gold
card or super card or diamond card, and so to do that they had to change my
account, and so some bills came in under the old account after they
transferred all the money out, and rather than credit, you know, move the
bills to the new account and pay them off, as they should, they sent me this
statement showing this huge interest charge on, uh --

A.31:  Boy.

B.32:  -- on the account --

A.33:  Yeah, I've --

B.34:  -- and it --

A.35:  -- #never gotten into an interest# --

B.36:  -- #took, took me a while to get# that straightened out.

A.37:  -- never gotten into an interest charge with American Express.  I know they
have it, but I just, you know, if you get it paid within the next thirty days
or something you don't have one. So.

B.38:  Yeah, well, I tried writing letters to get it straightened out, but, it,
uh, it took about eight months, and I finally said, cancel the account --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- and after about four months they quit sending me letters.  Uh, and now,
I only carry one, really, uh, my wife insisted that I get another credit card,
and, uh, so I do have a Visa card.

A.41:  Yeah, it's kind of hard to get by without one, you know, it's, I rent a lot
of videos, you got to have one there, and different places, and so you just
about got to have a major credit card.  My favorites, though, are department
store credit cards.  Uh, you can just stop in and shop when you want and don't
have to worry about your check book, or having cash.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  And I found out, with at least the two department stores we've done
business with for years, they treat you much nicer [laughter].  Uh, when you
have a balance you pay it, and there's never a problem with anything you want
or anything.  Uh, and our, give, give the cards to my sons, say, here, go get
what you want --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- that sort of thing.  So, those kind of particular credit cards I've
always liked.

B.46:  Yeah, well, I have another credit card.  Our company, when you travel, uh,
because of the tax regulations, they don't like to make cash advances, uh,
because there's, uh, they're concerned with the tax liability there, so, uh,
rather than make a, uh, cash advance, they issue a credit card, and you just
charge as you go --

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  -- and, uh, send your paper work in, and by the time the credit card bill
comes in, presumably you have your check from the company.

A.49:  When I work, that's the way we, uh, I had a corporate card with American
Express with my company, and everything was put on that.  They didn't care
what was put on there, just, and I, I usually, I think one time in all those
years I had a situation where my refund check, you know, my reimbursement
checks hadn't gotten here in time to make, you know, a payment of five or six
thousand, I had every month, too, and you just one time,
