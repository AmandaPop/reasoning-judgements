A.1:  Uh.

B.2:  What product did you have to return?

A.3:  I had to, uh, I had to return, uh, that recently I have had to return, uh,
uh, a cassette recorder.  Uh, [lipsmack] my feelings about products made
in the United States uh, recently is they are getting worse.  In fact, I am
kind of disappointment in American made things.  Uh, how about yourself?

B.4:  Well, I am kind of confused about American made products because Ford and
Chevy have Isuzu, Mazda engines [lipsmack] and they're considered American
products.  So I don't understand if we are supposed to not buy Volvos and
Volkswagons and Mazdas because they are foreign or if we are supposed to buy
American because they're foreign, but they are American cars.  You know what I
am saying?

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  I just don't understand that.

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  And it seems that whenever you do have a product, parts of it are both
American and overseas.  That it creates a problem.  Both in, uh, the product
and in the overall warranty or lasting.

A.9:  Ha-, have you recently bought a car?

B.10:  Yes, I did [static].

A.11:  What, what did you buy?

B.12:  I bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance.

A.13:  They are pretty much a hundred percent American made, aren't they #or do
you know?#

B.14:  #No.#

A.15:  Is that right?

B.16:  I was surprised, yes.  Chrysler has some of their parts built overseas also
and I thought that was totally American.  And, uh, that is why I stayed away
from General Motors and find out that the same thing happened to me anyway.

A.17:  I am really surprised to hear about, uh, I, I haven't studied cars probably
as closely as you have.  Uh, I was really surprised that you mentioned, uh,
Chrysler, no it was G M and Ford that are, uh, using Japanese motors and,

B.18:  And engines, that's true.

A.19:  Huh.  Oh.

B.20:  It seems that they're quote, unquote, American made.  Where was your V C R?

A.21:  Uh, it --

B.22:  What was it and what went wrong with it?

A.23:  -- yeah really, it was a Lloyd and, uh, it, it continually, I don't know
if, I think it is Japanese.  I think Lloyd is made in Japan and, uh, it, it was
eating my tapes and, uh, I don't know.  I am totally confounded about, uh, uh,
American made and Japanese and [inhaling] I am not sure which is the best.

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  I use the CONSUMER DIGEST a lot to decide what I want to buy.

B.26:  Yeah.  I do too.  Uh, I don't read it, but sometimes I (( )). Did you know
that Fitzhugh is a Japanese computer company and they deliberately make boards
and parts wrong so you will have to buy them --

A.27:  Huh.

B.28:  -- and it cannot be repaired.

A.29:  Huh.

B.30:  And that upset me when I found that out.

A.31:  Do you own a computer?

B.32:  No, I don't, but my daughter does and she worked with a computer company
that, uh, serviced them and she is the one that told me about that cause, uh,
we were, we are thinking about buying a computer.  We haven't done it yet and
uh, since she works for this compu-, computer company, I asked her what she
thought was best cause if T I was using Macs and I B M clones and this type of
thing.  And, uh, she was saying that she didn't know which one was the best
because of the way they're put together and then she was telling me about
this, uh, uh, co-, (( )) boards, just put in X number of, uh, computers and
then they last for eighteen months to no longer than two years and then
instead of repairing them you have to buy a whole new board.

A.33:  I didn't realize that.  I work for a C P A firm and we have a lot of
computers in our office and, uh, the computers we use mostly are Dale computers
and they are manufactured down in Texas.

B.34:  By whom?

A.35:  Uh, Dale Co-, Dale Corporation.  I'm not,

B.36:  Dale Corporation.  Where do they get their parts from, Fitzhugh?

A.37:  Uh, I, I don't know, ma'am.

B.38:  [Laughter].

A.39:  Uh, I wouldn't be surprised if most of them aren't Japanese parts but, uh,
we've had the Dale computers for four years now and we, we're really happy
with them.

B.40:  Are you?  #Well, maybe you're,#

A.41:  #And, we# use them every day.  We use them probably eight hours a day on
the average every day.  So they get a lot of use.

B.42:  Well, you are probably fortunate.

A.43:  (( )).

B.44:  You've probably got one of the better ones.

A.45:  Yep.

@@B.46:  So you work part time with an accountant also?

A.47:  I, I'm full timing with the accountant's office.

B.48:  Oh.
