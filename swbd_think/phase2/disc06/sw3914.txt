===========================================================================

A.1:  Kay, uh, do you have any strong feelings one way or the other about our
subject?

@B.2:  Oh, [inhaling] I've gone back and forth on this subject, uh, many years.
My husband use to be, uh, when we were dating, [popping] he use to really enjoy
[popping] going out and hunting.  You know, he grew up learning how to hunt.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, so [noise] I had grown up thinking that was an awful thing and then as
I learned more about it I realized some of the advantages and [noise] and then
the real reason people, most people go out there and hunt.  And so, I kind of
got accustomed to the idea.  But, then over the years, and when you hear so
much about, uh, what, what's actually going on out there, it is kind of a
volatile subject and, and I, I tell you at this point in time I cannot give
you, uh, a real answer to how I feel on it.  I think I would agree with the
with some of the, uh, things, the movements out there that are trying to get a,
a time, at least a time restraint on purchasing guns --

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  -- so that, you know, there's some research that can go on before someone
can just walk out with a gun.  I do feel like that's worthwhile and making
sure that that kind of thing goes on.  But as far as not allowing sales of
guns to the public, I think that's a little drastic and not realistic because
as we all know when there's a ban on anything, the people that shouldn't have
them still get it anyway.  So, I don't see where that's going to solve
anything personally  [noise].

A.7:  Well, I guess I feel any of the automatic or semi automatic weapons [noise]
should be [noise], uh, banned.

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  Uh, I am not quite certain about how I feel about hand guns in that I
guess, [sniffing] [inhaling] uh, you know, it's like [noise] do you want to
protect yourse-, [noise] we don't have a hand gun.  My husband has an old,
some kind of a rifle from World War Two or something that I don't think even
has any bullets in it.

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  But, uh, hunting weapons don't bother me.  Uh, I am not particularly for
hunting.  I am not opposed to it.  You know, I am not exactly animals rights
or anything, but I am personally glad my husband doesn't like to hunt.  But,
uh, my dad use to hunt and you know, he hunted for food, basically squirrels
and that sort of thing --

B.12:  Uh-huh.

A.13:  -- and that's, that's fine.  That's fine with me.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  But, uh, I know on the hand gun issue that's, uh, that's one I have a
little bit of difficulty with knowing exactly which way, but I do think that
any of the, uh, the semi automatic weapons and all should be, uh, not allowed
at all.

B.16:  Yeah.  Yeah, I have to agree with you [popping] there.  Uh, yeah I think
that after my husband actually got away from hunting just due to the fact that
he was busy working and all.  He's also kind of lost the, the love of going
out there and hunting like he once use to --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- in fact, I think if he really had the time to get back in the
wilderness, I think he had rather grab a camera now than the, the gun #and
try,#

A.19:  #Good# for him.

B.20:  Yeah [laughter].

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  And try to rather capture it that way than,

A.23:  [/Laughter].

B.24:  uh, because really there's no sense of, uh, the joy of it like he once had
and I think that, you know, what he was use to when he was a kid and what they
did as a family.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Compared to now what his priorities are I think.

A.27:  Uh, to tell you the truth, I was awfully afraid I was going to get hold of
a man that was, uh, radical you know.  [laughter] And we would go in as a
shouting match.  With what's going on with this thing [laughter].

B.28:  Yeah.  There are some real strong minded [noise] people on this issue.

A.29:  Oh, yes.  The American Rifle Association people and all and, I, you know, I
mean they don't want, from what I understand, any controls on anything of any
sort and,

B.30:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.31:  Uh, I just don't think we need free reign and you hear of the people
walking in and [inhaling] shooting, uh, well not even that so much.
[inhaling] Uh, the incident that I heard a few weeks ago on the news about
this lady whose little boys were in the back seat of the car and she had a
semi automatic weapon and the little boy shot his brother.

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  I mean, what are people doing --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- with, with guns like that around little kids?  I don't understand.

B.36:  Yeah, that's the problem.  There are many fools out there that just don't
think --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- you know always, you know, my kids are smarter and they know about guns
[laughter] and what happens then.  It may not happen to their kid, but it will
happen to the neighbor who doesn't understand it --

A.39:  Uh-huh.

B.40:  -- and happens to come by and visit. [noise] Or, you know, that kind of
thing.  Unfortunate that there are many people out there that just don't have
a lot of common sense. [inhaling] And I think that could happen.

A.41:  [Inhaling] I see, do we need to vote on a our one to ten [laughter]?

B.42: [Laughter] Oh, I don't know.  Does it really register what #we're saying?#

A.43:  #I think not# [laughter].

B.44:  Uh,

A.45:  [/Laughter].

B.46:  let's see, I got confused, it was a one to ten on what?

A.47:  Uh, well one is if you want a total ban and ten is, is if you want, uh, no
bans on anything.

B.48:  Oh, uh, you know, I would have to put myself at a five.

A.49:  I probably would go a four.

B.50:  Oh.

A.51:  But [laughter] we aren't too far off there.

B.52:  Yeah.  

A.53:  Well, I usually talk until this is over but Leslie as,
