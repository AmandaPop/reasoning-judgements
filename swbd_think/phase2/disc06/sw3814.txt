REMARKS:        Speaker B was extremely difficult to understand. 
He spoke very quickly and mumbled.

=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, here we go.  

@B.2:  So, uh,  

A.3:  So what's your favorite team?  

B.4:  Uh, a Cowboy fan, die hard.  

A.5:  Naturally, huh [laughter].  

B.6:  Yeah, ever since I was, last sixteen, seventeen years. 

A.7:  Oh, really?  

B.8:  As long as I can remember.  Yeah, was in seventy-six, but, uh, yeah big
time.  They're, uh, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now after the season
they had.  What part of Patterson, w-, s-, n-, uh, California is that?

A.9:  It's, uh, like seventy-five miles from Oakland and San Francisco.

B.10:  Oh, okay, so you're up,

A.11:  It's in the valley.  

B.12:  Okay.  

A.13:  Okay.  

B.14:  So I guess you're, uh,

A.15:  Well, I used to be a Raider fan -- 

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  -- when they were there, but now I'm a Forty-niner fan.  

B.18:  There you go.  

A.19:  You know.   

B.20:  There you go.  

A.21:  And the Forty-niners just went down, down, down this year.  

B.22:  Yeah, but if they would have made the playoffs, I mean, I they were, they
were the hottest team I thought --

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  -- in the season, it's just, it's kind of, it's kind of bad that they miss
out on the playoffs in the tie breaker or whatever but,

A.25:  Y-, yeah, right, right.  

B.26:  Um, I think, uh,

A.27:  So, what do you think's going to happen Sunday?  

B.28:  Uh, I think it's, uh, Buffalo.  

A.29:  I hope it's Buffalo.  

B.30:  I really do, I think it's their time to,

A.31:  You know.  

B.32:  Everyone's -- 

A.33:  I really, I'm,

B.34:  -- taking Washington, but I don't know, I mean, get the A F C and getting
beat up every year, you know.

A.35:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.36:  Lost a few Super Bowls that,

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  They went last year, they should have won it and, you know, missed that
kick but,

A.39:  Yeah, lost by what, one point?  

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  Yeah.  

B.42:  Pretty bad for kicker, but I think they'll do it.  

A.43:  Uh-huh.  

B.44:  I mean naturally Redskins,

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  and the Cowboys don't have much like for each other, but, uh,

A.47:  Well, at least Dallas was in the playoffs, you know.  

B.48:  Yeah, it's, they way they --

A.49:  ((What)),

B.50:  -- went out, they didn't go, they got killed by Detroit but,

A.51:  Yeah.  

B.52:  They're young team, I mean, they got all those draft picks next year, I
mean, their future's, I mean, they're one of the young-, I mean, they got so
many stars.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  Jimmy Johnson, I mean, you never know what he's going to do. 

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  It's just,

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  Guys a wizard at drafting -- 

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- people.  

A.61:  Uh-huh, do you get to go to very many games?  

B.62:  I went to [breathing] four games this year, actually.  Uh,

A.63:  Uh-huh.  

B.64:  Friends of mine have season tickets, we've al-, it's always, uh, each year
we've taken turns getting them and kind of,

A.65:  [Cough] {by someone in the background}. 

B.66:  switched around on them, everything.  

A.67:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.68:  And I just graduated and I moved back, so I got to see more games finally.

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  I went to school at Texas Tech out in Lubbock, Texas for -- 

A.71:  Um.  

B.72:  -- about four years, so -- 

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  -- I saw the games on T V,

A.75:  [Cough] {by someone in the background}.

B.76:  but I haven't been to any since, you know -- 

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  -- Thanksgiving once, I guess.  

A.79:  Uh-huh.  

B.80:  So you make any Forty-niner games?  

A.81:  No, I've never been to a Forty-niner game.  I used to go to all the Raider
games when they were in Oakland.

B.82:  Yeah, I guess, still want them back in Oakland, huh?  

A.83:  That would be nice, yeah, but, uh, I don't think that's ever going to
happen [laughter].

B.84:  Yeah, just, there's not many Al Davis fans out there.  

A.85:  You know, uh, now I'm just waiting for something to come off, out this way,
out in the valley [laughter].

B.86:  Uh, you got the, so many,

A.87:  Sacramento still has a chance, I guess of getting a team someday.

B.88:  Yeah, there's so many teams out in California, though, I mean, that's, the
Rams, Raiders.

A.89:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.90:  Uh, that's just,

A.91:  So, you plan on, uh, watching the game Sunday?  

B.92:  Yeah, uh, going to a Super Bowl party actually.  So,

A.93:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.94:  I'll be out there for,

A.95:  Well, that will be nice [cough] {by someone in the background}.

B.96:  Do it every year. 

A.97:  Yeah, that will be nice.  

B.98:  How about you all?  

A.99:  Yeah, we're going to have a little, few people over to watch the game.  You
know, just serve hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that so we won't have to miss
out on anything.

B.100:  Right.  

A.101:  [Laughter]. 

B.102:  And, there you go.  

A.103:  So,

B.104:  Yeah, I just wish it would start a little bit earlier because I guess,
well, out there it starts at four, but starts at six here, you know, it's, I
don't, I mean, people, you know, that, they're wondering why their ratings go
down every year, because people get, don't like them,

A.105:  I know, it's too late, huh?  

B.106:  Yeah, I mean, a time, because a lot of people, you know, they got to work
the next day.  They don't want to be sitting around at nine or ten at night
and, you know, they start taking off but,

A.107:  Yeah, I was wondering for sure what time it started.  I thought it was
three or something, but you say it's four out --

B.108:  Yeah.

A.109:  -- here, huh.  

B.110:  It's six, six o'clock here, or -- 

A.111:  Six o'clock -- 

B.112:  -- six eighteen.

A.113:  -- your time, huh?  

B.114:  So that will be,

A.115:  That's terrible.  

B.116:  But, it's one good thing about living out there.  

A.117:  Yeah, yeah.  

B.118:  Daylight everything.  

A.119:  Yeah well,

@@B.120:  Well, I guess, that will do it.  

A.121:  Yeah, okay, then.  

B.122:  Okay.  

A.123:  It's been nice talking to you Brad.  

B.124:  Yeah, all right.  

A.125:  All right.  

B.126:  ((Talk to you later)), bye.  

A.127:  Bye-bye.
