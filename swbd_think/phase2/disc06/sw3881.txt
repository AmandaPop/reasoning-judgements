===========================================================================

B.1:  Uh,

A.2:  What, uh, you have some ideas on the to help out the President here?

B.3:  I think that one of the things they are going to have to do is go back and
take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on
investment.  Uh, there's an awful lot of federal programs that, uh, they put a
million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth
of good.

A.4:  Right.  I, I think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what
they throw money at.

B.5:  And there's some things, some programs that just don't seem to be working
at all.  Uh, an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs. They're
just seem to be self perpetuating and, uh, certainly in a lot of the state and
local regulations that are involved just force individuals into perpetuating
the same activity and gives them no incentive whatever to solve their own
problems.

A.6:  Right.  People get get where they depend on the benefit and they don't have
much interest and there is no, uh, uh, enforcing, uh, ability I think to make
sure that it doesn't get continued.  There's there's a lot of waste as a
result.  I think of that.

B.7:  Well, some of the things that happen in welfare programs that, uh, they are
inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a, uh, male
present in the family.

A.8:  Yeah.

B.9:  So that has resulted in, uh, the family [talking] dissolving.  The husband
is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare --

A.10:  Yeah.

B.11:  -- then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance
without, uh, the father roll around #and they# --

A.12:  #Well, uh, I,#

B.13:  -- wind up doing exactly the same thing.

A.14:  Yeah.  I think there's, uh, there's a good opportunity if they will take
advantage of it with the, with the, the defense needs not as great as they use
to be.  Uh, if, and combine the savings there with, with the savings in all
these give away programs and the waste that's in welfare and a lot of other
programs.  I think they can start to get a handle on, on the budget though
what I am afraid is they will just continue wasting money the way they have
and, and, uh, throw, throw potential savings into, uh, more programs that don't
do any good.

B.15:  I think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and
superfluous regulation [noise].

A.16:  #Well, there was, there was# --

B.17:  #I know that,# 

A.18:  -- was a study.  I don't know if you heard of it, it was the Grape
Commission.

B.19:  Uh-huh.

A.20:  Uh, and it, it he was, uh, a private, uh, individual and he did a study on
on cutting waste out of government and he came up with, I forget the figure,
but it was a tremendous [noise] amount of savings that could be cut out
without really cutting benefits.  Uh --

B.21:  Yeah.

A.22:  -- just the waste that went on [talking].

B.23:  Well I know that, uh, well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when
we were writing a proposal to work on some program, we would sit down with an
old Freidman mechanical calculator and work out a one or two page cost
proposal.

A.24:  Uh-huh.

B.25:  And now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program, we have
a Compact three eighty-six and it runs for about three days and generates
about three hundred pages of uh, nonsense to for --

A.26:  Right.  Yeah.

B.27:  -- somebody to go read. 

A.28:  You wonder if all that is necessary and that's the same in government I
guess.  It's --

B.29:  Yeah.

A.30:  -- is it all necessary.

B.31:  And, uh, you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do, why
[laughter].

A.32:  Yeah. Yeah.  And it perpetuates a lot more jobs.  I think is what it does.

B.33:  #And, uh# --

A.34:  #But, but,# 

B.35:  -- uh, I think one of the problems we're having with, uh, schools, uh, is
sort of the same factor that, uh, when I was going to school we had, uh, a
Principal, Assistant Principal and everybody else was teaching except the
janitor.

A.36:  Uh-huh.

B.37:  And now, it seems like there's, uh, as many administrators and
administrative assistants as we have teachers.

A.38:  Yeah.

B.39:  #And, uh# -- 

A.40:  #Well,#

B.41:  -- the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty
percent.

A.42:  Well, with the economy overall getting bad, a lot of companies have had to
really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the
government has really never tried hard to do.  Uh, they just have to learn to
live within their budget, I think and not, uh, allow this bunch to get out of
hand like they have.

B.43:  Uh-huh.

A.44:  Uh, there's no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare
and these programs when you're going into debt to do it.

B.45:  And I think that the government also goes overboard, uh, on the way [noise]
they do things.  Uh, we have a, a new sewage treatment facility near here
that's, uh, one of the fine E P A approved things that does a super job of
cleaning up the water and they have an administrative building associated with
it but, uh, have,
