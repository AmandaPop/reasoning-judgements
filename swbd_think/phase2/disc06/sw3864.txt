==========================================================================

A.1:  That's, that's a timely kind of question, isn't it?

B.2:  Yeah, it was, yes.  What did you think about the uh, former Soviet Union?

A.3:  I really don't thing that I would consider them a threat any longer and I
suppose that is primarily because their economy really won't allow them to
expend a lot of resources on on war.  Uh, if that were the primary concern.

B.4:  Yeah [throat_clearing].

A.5:  And it will be a while before they are an economic threat, for sure.

B.6:  It seems that way.  Sometimes, you wonder if, uh, an economic threat isn't
going to drive people to do things that would be more drastic than, if, uh,
they were a little more peaceful, you know.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh [inhaling].

B.8:  But, I think it would probably not be, uh, a threat to the United States if
that was the case.  It would probably be Europe, uh, other areas of Europe
there.

A.9:  Do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they
would be a threat, but, uh, but given their political changes they would still
be a threat or,

B.10:  Well, that is what it seemed like, even before they, uh, dissolved the
Union which was becoming less and less of a threat to the United States --

A.11:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- uh, more and more of an attempted, uh, you know, relating on more or
less normal basis --

A.13:  Right.

B.14:  -- are you, uh, involved,  

A.15:  There there has been such drastic changes in their political orientation
that it's hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years, but certainly
so far what we have seen is [laughter] --

B.16:  Oh that's true.

A.17:  -- a turn around from where things were fifty years ago.

B.18:  Yeah, that is for sure.  Are you involved in any kind of, uh, #political
analysis# --

A.19:  #No#, no.

B.20:  -- or anything?

A.21:  And yourself?

B.22:  No, not really.  We are involved in some of our company work in the Soviet
Union and --

A.23:  Really.

B.24:  -- but not in, uh, any area of, uh, endeavor that would be of any interest
to, uh, you know, militarily or anything.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  Is that personal interests or business?

B.26:  Uh, linguistics primarily.

A.27:  Uh-huh.

B.28:  And so, it's interesting to see, uh, how, things are going there and, and,
uh, the people there are facing the same kind of economic deprivation that,
uh, you know the Russian citizens are --

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  -- but it does relate to much to military situations.

A.31:  Yes.  Their problems at this point are definitely economic.  It seems that
the whole infrastructure is focused on, uh, organizational, uh, skimming off
the top, you know, especially the government but, um, it is going to be awhile
before the people adopt the philosophy that if you work harder you can also
benefit personally in it.

B.32:  Yeah, I read an int-, an article in the recent, uh, WALL STREET JOURNAL,
interview with a family there and, uh, we think of how great it is to go to,
you know, a flea market, uh, that sort of thing --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and they are facing, uh, something that most people are not even aware,
you know, familiar with.  They don't know how to deal with it.

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  How do you compete when you're whole, you know, life has been built on, uh,
working for the State and everything, you know.

A.37:  And, uh, almost, uh, the philosophy is then, put in as little as you can
because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so,

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  Why spend any extra energy.

B.40:  You face the same, uh, bureaucratic, uh, headaches whether you work or
don't work --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- so now they, you know, so really, it must be, uh, a really traumatic
time for the people --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- as well as the, uh, lack of supplies or anything like that, adjusting to
the new way of thinking about things.

A.45:  I wonder too, if their thinking hasn't been so influenced over the years
that the Western way is bad --

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- that, it's it's hard for them to look at some of the Western market
place strategy as being good --

B.48:  Yeah. Right.

A.49:  -- because they have been,

B.50:  Taught to understand, yeah that is right.

A.51:  Probably not as the other direction, just for so long.

B.52:  Yeah, perhaps the, uh, if we give aid of some sort, you know, maybe it will
turn them around if it is done done correctly.  You know?

A.53:  I think that we are one economy that I feel that, that is worth the
investment.  You know, there are some, uh, places in the world where I am not
sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the
kind of return that, uh, that's going to benefit both parties, but, uh, it
seems that there is such an effort to make it work there, that, but they
really do need is the loans and the uh, strategic assistance from other
countries.

B.54:  Sure.

A.55:  I will be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't
seem as though that is forth coming right now.  Uh,

B.56:  You mean, in our country or in,

A.57:  Well, I think that I was watching something the other day, a news program
that that indicated, uh, the concerns on Bush's part is that if he puts great
interest in that area now, he is going to be accused of not spending enough
time on the domestic issues.

B.58:  Sure.

A.59:  You know, certainly foreign issues are his strength.  So, it is a catch
twenty two [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah, you can't that is right.  Well, I hope, I just hope that we can wait
too long and uh,
