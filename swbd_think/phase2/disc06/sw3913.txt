REMARKS:  	Speaker A talks to dog.

========================================================================

A.1:  (( )) the opportunity to, uh, talk with someone with my name [laughter].

B.2:  No.  There's really not very many.

A.3:  No, there really aren't.

B.4:  When I went to school there was probably three, you know, with various
ages, but you don't, you don't find that name very often.

A.5:  Uh-huh, that's interesting.  Well, are you, uh, involved in any kind of
home repair projects right now?

@B.6:  Uh, we just got through having the ceiling in the kitchen touched up.

A.7:  Did you all have,

B.8:  The roof.  We had a lot of rain and the roof was leaking and it went down
and had a big spot on the ceiling.  And we intended to, to fix it our self.

A.9:  Oh.

B.10:  And that didn't work.  So we ended up hiring just, uh, a handy man.  And it
turned into a huge project for him.

A.11:  Um.

B.12:  And he couldn't, he tried to match the spot.  He couldn't match it and
ended up having to do the whole ceiling over.

A.13:  The whole.  Well, we have a spot just like that in our [laughter] kitchen,
but we haven't, uh, it's just a stain.  You know, it's not really, it's a stain
on the paint.  It's not where water actually leaked.

B.14:  Uh-huh.

A.15:  Uh, on, the, I mean it's not like a hole in the ceiling and, uh, I don't
know, I know there's stuff you can get sealer and stuff that actually has some
color to it, but we are probably going to have to end up repainting the whole
ceiling #too.#

B.16:  #Yeah I# think so.  But we tried, just, at first, just kind of spackling
it. It's one of those type ceilings.  This is an older house --

A.17:  Oh.

B.18:  -- and we trying to just repair that and match the, the, uh, texture --

A.19:  Oh.

B.20:  -- and couldn't do that.

A.21:  #Is it# --

B.22:  #And then,#

A.23:  -- like a, is is like a popcorn ceiling or what's the texture?

B.24:  It's, I'm not even sure what it is.  It's not like the kind at my mother's
house is a blown texture.

A.25:  Oh, uh-huh.

B.26:  And this is an old, older house and it's kind of a sponge is what it looks
like to me [laughter].

A.27:  Huh.

B.28:  That they took the, uh, plaster and kind of sponged it.

A.29:  Huh.

B.30:  But, it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it
and the paint and everything.  He finally just had to redo the whole ceiling
[laughter] repaint the whole thing.

A.31:  Well, that's probably the easiest thing to do --

B.32:  Uh-huh.

A.33:  -- I guess --

B.34:  #But he, uh# --

A.35:  -- #in that case.#

B.36:  -- I was surprised.  He stuck with the price that he had quoted.

A.37:  Wow.

B.38:  Which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he
found out that the beam there was not support to attach his stuff to and it
turned out to be a mess.

A.39:  Huh.

B.40:  [Laughter]  He --

A.41:  Well,

B.42:  --  finally, finally got it finished.

A.43:  And it looks nice.

B.44:  It does.  I was, cause it took several days and I work.  So he would go on
and on during the ho-, --

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  -- during the day and then I would just have to come home and call him at
night and say excuse me, [laughter] this doesn't look good.

A.47:  Yeah.

B.48:  Because he was going to let it go.  If I hadn't said anything at first when
it didn't match and stuff.  He was just going to go with that.  [noise] And I
am sure no body would notice if they come in and they don't look up
immediately --

A.49:  Right, #right.#

B.50:  -- #but I noticed# but when he fixed it.  But this the house it belongs to
my father-in-law and our deal as far as living here and each month we fix
something.

A.51:  Uh-huh [laughter].

B.52:  And we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in
and we put new linoleum and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor
in the bathroom and wallpaper.  But just as soon as you get finished with one
job it's time for another.

A.53:  Well, we are in the midst of all that now.  See we have lived in our house
for, uh, two years and, uh [throat_clearing], we have a dog, it's just, she's
like a child.  She wants to play.  [laughter] As soon as you get the phone she,

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  my dog is trying to, uh, a fifty pound dog is trying to get in my lap.  Uh,
anyway, uh, so we really have not done much to the house.  We kind of worked
on the landscaping outside, but, but this year we've made, uh, kind of a list
of things we want to do and we devote half of every Saturday to our work
projects and then one night a week and, uh, so right now we are painting our
master bedroom.  Actually, my husband.  I can't [laughter].  I am expecting so
I am not suppose to be around the paint fumes [laughter].

B.56:  Oh.

A.57:  #So,#

B.58:  #Well, see# you chose a good job.

A.59:  Yeah, I chose a good job.  #So, I don't have# --

B.60:  #Well, congratulations.  When is your# --     

A.61:  -- to help.

B.62:  -- baby due?

A.63:  When is it due?

B.64:  Uh-huh.

A.65:  July.

B.66:  Well, that good.  #It won't be too long.# 

A.67:  #So, we're,# we're working on the master bedroom first and then we will
eventually get to the baby's room and, you know, try to decide what we want to
do in there but, uh, we have [throat_clearing] the people that lived here
before us, uh, uh, the house is about twelve years old and ouch, she just
tried to bite me {talking to dog},

B.68:  [Laughter].

A.69:  uh, but, it's a custom home and it has a lot of neat things to it, but they
also went I think a cheap route, you know they --

B.70:  Uh-huh.

A.71:  -- on some things.  And there's one wall in this bedroom that, uh, that,
uh, are in, one of our guest bedrooms that was painted gray and the rest of
the walls are white and it looks like it must have had wallpaper on it and
they took the wallpaper off and then tried to retexture it --

B.72:  Uh-huh.

A.73:  -- and it's horrible.  It just looks like it just rained.
