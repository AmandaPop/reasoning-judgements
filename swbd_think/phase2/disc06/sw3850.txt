=======================================================================

A.1:  Okay.

B.2:  So, what are your favorite shows?

@A.3:  Um, I like watching COLOMBO and, um, MATLOCK and --

B.4:  Oh, really?

A.5:  -- QUANTUM LEAP, yeah.

B.6:  QUANTUM LEAP?

A.7:  Uh-huh.

B.8:  Did you see it the other night?

A.9:  Um, uh-huh.

B.10:  That was, that was pretty good.

A.11:  Yeah, that one was.  #What about,# 

B.12:  #What do you,# with the psychic and everything?

A.13:  Uh-huh, yeah.

B.14:  Okay.  Yeah, I like, uh, I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, uh, HOME
IMPROVEMENT.

A.15:  Oh, I, well I haven't seen either of those [laughter].

B.16:  You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE?

A.17:  Huh-uh.

B.18:  [Baby_talking] Oh, it's a great show. 

A.19:  Um, I also like to watch STAR TREK, but it's on so late here, that I don't
always get to see it [laughter].

B.20:  [Baby_talking] Really?  Yeah, we like it, too.  Have you seen the movie?

A.21:  Uh, [baby_talking] I haven't seen any of the movies [laughter] because I
just barely, just like in the last year or so got interested in it, and
they're, you know, already out with number six by now, but.  So I haven't seen
any of the movies, yet, but I.

B.22:  Oh, you haven't seen any of them.

A.23:  [Laughter] No.

B.24:  Oh, well, they're good, they're real good.  They're, uh, they're getting
rid of the old cast for the movies, though.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  Which ones are you watching, the new ones?

A.27:  Yeah, I've seen quite a few of the older ones.  I haven't seen really the
new generation that much.

B.28:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.

A.29:  Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the youn-, the newer one?

B.30:  Well, they're, [breathing] they're a lot different.  But, I like, I like
the older ones because at that time, you know, they were really futuristic,
you know.

A.31:  Oh, yeah.

B.32:  And the newer ones are, I guess the newer ones are real [laughter]
futuristic, too, but I like, I like both of them.

A.33:  Yeah, I do too.  I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a
lot, I mean, he almost hates the new ones [laughter].

B.34:  Really?

A.35:  Yeah, because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the
other one isn't or something, but, [laughter] #I don't [laughter].#

B.36:  #No.#  Not really.  #It's not really like# --

A.37:  #Oh, I think,# 

B.38:  -- #a soap# --

A.39:  #Yeah.#

B.40:  -- opera, but, but it's, but that's true, I mean, you, you learn more about
the characters and stuff, but that's the way all shows are now.

A.41:  Yeah, sure.  Well, let's see.  Um, I like to watch COLOMBO because it's
like a mystery thing.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  That's sort of how Matlock is, but COLOMBO is way tricky [laughter] --

B.44:  #Yeah.#

A.45:  -- #I mean# he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto
them.

B.46:  #[Throat_clearing] Well, it seems like they always# --

A.47:  #Well, did you see the one.#

B.48:  -- show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though --

A.49:  Um.

B.50:  -- you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college, or is
this, is there a series on.

A.51:  Um, yeah, there's like one on, well we see it Thursdays at seven, #and# --

B.52:  #Okay.#

A.53:  -- it was, this last time it was about this, um, movie director, did you
hap-, --

B.54:  Yeah, I #saw that one.#

A.55:  -- #did you see that?#

B.56:  See, that was a rerun.

A.57:  Really?  #Oh, I guess I nev-,# 

B.58:  #Yeah, I wondered if that's# --

A.59:  Huh.

B.60:  -- see I don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what, but it
seems like there's only about four or five different ones, and then, then they
keep showing them over and over.

A.61:  Oh, I guess I've, I haven't #seen it before.#

B.62:  #He was a movie# director, and he had that gal killed.

A.63:  Yeah --

B.64:  Okay.

A.65:  -- yeah, on the set or something.

B.66:  That was pretty good though [laughter].

A.67:  Yeah, it was.  But, yeah, I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those
mystery things.

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  But, um, there's no, never anything good on Saturdays, though [laughter].

B.70:  No kidding.

A.71:  I don't think so.  Well, STAR TREK'S on at five, but I'm never home so,

B.72:  What is it that, there's something I watch, something I watch on Saturdays,
and I can't remember what it is.  Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS.

A.73:  Oh.

B.74:  You never saw that?

A.75:  I've heard of it a lot, I've heard of, a lot of people somehow or something
[clanking].  They'll say, so and so from TWIN PEAKS, or something, you know.

B.76:  Yeah, yeah that was a different soap opera.

A.77:  [Laughter] Oh.

B.78:  But, it was, it was a different type of show.

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  I didn't like the way it ended, though.

A.81:  Oh, did they end the whole series?

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  Oh.

B.84:  Yeah, they didn't, they only did it for, I think, two years.

A.85:  Oh.

B.86:  But it's all over now.

A.87:  Oh, another show I like to watch is MASH.
