============================================================================

B.1:  Okay.  

A.2:  Uh, go ahead.  

B.3:  What are we supposed to discuss again?   

@A.4: AIDS research is something that, 

B.5:   #More money (( )),# 

A.6:  #that, I think# th-, whether our country is putting enough money into it
and actually I'm concerned that they're not.  I have a friend who is working
with, uh, who works with, uh, travel groups,

B.7:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.8:  #and one# of the ones that he's w-, worked with was professionals who came
in for an AIDS, uh, conference in, uh, California.

B.9:  Uh-huh.  

A.10:  And these were from other, people from other countries.  He's a translator.

B.11:  Uh-huh.  

A.12:  And in talking to the people from France he said, you know, he says, one of
the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you
enough about how it ((pervasive)) and frightening this epidemic is.  And
they're letting,

B.13:  #Huh.# 

A.14:  #the information# out slowly about how, you know, how big it is.  Which is
scary, you know, pretty scary when so many people get it.  So, I guess I'm,
I'm, I'd like to see us spend more.  I don't know that spending more always
gets it.

B.15:  Yeah.  I'm, I'm ambivalent about it because, um, uh, i-, well it is very
frightening and scary.  I have no perspective on how it relates to other
diseases, and, uh, I mean whether,

A.16:  You mean more money for that means less for cancer or,

B.17:  Yes.  

A.18:  Y-, yeah.  

B.19:  And, uh, whether those diseases can yo-, some difference could be made if
you did pour more money in like diabetes research --

A.20:  Uh-huh.

B.21:  -- uh -- 

A.22:  Uh-huh.  

B.23:  -- didn't, uh, you know, but I, uh, then t-, part of it's lack of
education.  I don't know whether, whether, you know, where our money would be
most effectively spent.

A.24:  Well it, I, I agree with you there because I know every time that i-,
something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know
whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie.

B.25:  Uh-huh.  

A.26:  Money from, money for taking care of the infants takes money away from
taking care of the elderly, or do they both get served?  Uh, that's a good
point.

B.27:  And I'm, I am concerned a lot about, uh, I'm concerned about, uh, two
things.  One is preventing the spread and the other is for, uh, for, uh,
treating the illness.

A.28:  Uh-huh.  

B.29:  And I'm not certain, I, I, again this, I'm telling you, basically I don't
have any opinion.

A.30:  Uh-huh.  

B.31:  But whether or not it would be, uh, our money would be better spent, uh,
teaching, you know, working on the drug problems and the, and the sex
problems, uh, rather than trying to cure the people that already have it.

A.32:  Well, and one of the things I'd, and I'm with you that I don't know is, is
that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to
tell us and we're going to find out more.

B.33:   Yeah, well, you know, 

A.34:   #That's, that's the part that,# 

B.35:  #t-, d-, whether my dentist or# [laughter],

A.36:  [Laughter] That's the part that scares me, you know.  I mean beginning with
this is, this is just for homosexuals, well no, it's for homosexuals and gays,
well no, actually, it's, I mean, you know.  Did they know that all along?

B.37:  An-, and I heard something the other day, this sounds ridiculous, about
mosquitoes.  And, you know, they've been saying oh, no, absolutely not.  Can't
get it from mosquitoes.  And, uh, and now they are saying well maybe in the
right conditions, yes.

A.38:  Oh [laughter] 

B.39:  And I don't know that's true or not.  I mean, I just heard it in passing,
but so what does that,

A.40:  #Right.# [laughter].

B.41:  #what does# that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with
and [breathing], 

A.42:  And how is it really transmitted, 

B.43:  #Yeah.#  

A.44:  #et cetera.# Which is, I think, what they also don't know.  I mean that's,
I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know.

B.45:  Uh-huh.  

A.46:  It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have
trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway, but, but that
isn't how it was in Africa.

B.47:  #No.# 

A.48:  #In# Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that, and
it's huge over there.  So I, I, you know, and it's beginning, t-, other
countries that's what's his point.  This was an international,

B.49:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.50:  #conference# where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you
know, like this.  And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are
all these different strains of it?

B.51:  Oh.  

A.52:  I mean I don't know.  [laughter] All I'm saying is I think it's scarier
than we know.  Uh, or maybe they understand but, 

B.53:  I think maybe more information should be given out about it.

A.54:  Yeah, and, uh, and then the people that have it, it does seem that there
are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back.  If
you, if I were dying, I'm not sure I would care.

B.55:  I, I, give me cyanide.  I mean, [laughter] #is it (( )),# 

A.56:  #Yeah, right.#  [laughter]  I'll take anything -- 

B.57:  Uh-huh.  

A.58:  -- you know.  I mean if I'm dying, if I know I'm dying, 

B.59:  #Ri-,#

A.60:  #you can# experiment on me.  

B.61:  #Exactly.# 

A.62:  #Go ahead.# 

B.63:  And why can't you, why can't the F D A say, you know, i-, if these people
knowingly consent to be,

A.64:  #Exactly.#   

B.65:  #research# monkeys and well, let them, let them,

A.66:  #Yeah.# 

B.67:  #do it.# 

A.68:  Yeah.  And that's what I think they're saying too.
