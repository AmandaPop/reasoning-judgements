=======================================================================

A.1:  What do you think about drug testing?  

B.2:  Well,

A.3:  [Noise]. 

@B.4:  Unnecess-, a necessary evil, I guess.  

A.5:  Yeah, I think that it's appropriate in some job categories.  Uh, jobs that
involve safety and, you know, that, that performance of which really would
have an effect on the, the, the lives and safety of other people, you know,
health professionals and people who, uh, operate machinery and fly and, or
drive, whatever, I think that those are really important.  I'm not sure how I
feel about, about other jobs, just, uh, for the purpose of determining whether
or not an employee is drug free, you know, on, on general principles.

B.6:  Well,

A.7:  But I can really see the justification for the others.  

B.8:  Yeah, uh, I guess I'm, uh, ((partly)) biased since we just recently, our
company's gone to the, uh, process of initiating drug testing on a random
basis.

A.9:  Uh-huh.  For all job categories?  

B.10:  Everybody, uh, in the corporation.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  So whether you're an executive behind a desk or you're operating a
vehicle or whatever [child_yelling].

B.12:  That's correct.  

A.13:  A-, and how do they, how do they do that?  How often, generally, does
random mean?

B.14:  Well, it's, uh, other than they, uh, they insisted on the, uh, you know,
management and supervision taking the, uh, being done within the first year,
which we've all been done, you know, uh, seems to be,

A.15:  So, in the past month?  

B.16:  The past year.  

A.17:  Oh, since nineteen ninety-one it started.  Is that right?  

B.18:  Uh, right, act-, -- 

A.19:  Uh-huh.  

B.20:  -- late in ninety it was.  But, you know, they, it's fairly infrequent.
It's just that it's there, you know.

A.21:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  When you say infrequent, is it maybe once a quarter 
or,

B.22:  Oh, Lord, no, I don't think, uh, first of all in my group, hardly a fourth
of them have been tested, you know.

A.23:  How large is that group?  

B.24:  Uh, it's about, uh, twenty people.  

A.25:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  So what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do
that, that the company chose to do that?

B.26:  Well,

A.27:  Was it insurance issue or -- 

B.28:  That, uh, and -- 

A.29:  -- safety issue?  

B.30:  -- they want to, you know, social, uh, issues.  

A.31:  Uh-huh.  So, uh, on a performance level, there was actually a problem with
abuse of substances [child_talking] and they wanted to make sure that they
were reducing that or,

B.32:  Yeah, I think that, that was probably the prime motivation -- 

A.33:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.34:  -- #and insurance,# like you say, to get, uh,   

A.35:  Yeah.  What kind of a company is it?  

B.36:  Texas Instruments.  

A.37:  Oh, I guess I should have figured [laughter].  

B.38:  [Laughter]. 

A.39:  Anybody I talk to in Texas i-, is probably [laughter] from T I.

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  Interesting, well, they really, I guess I shouldn't stray from the subject,
but they have some very interesting topics for, for questions.  I often wonder
who has created them.

B.42:  Yeah, I guess there, uh, may have been just a committee throwing out
suggestions.

A.43:  [Laughter] Was the response from the employees regarding drug testing
favorable or,

B.44:  It was, uh, it was received at our site here in Houston fairly easily.
However, in Austin, where they have a lot of engineers and, uh, I guess a
younger set, uh, people, they, uh, they were pretty, uh, a lot of people quit
over it and, uh, quite a --

A.45:  Oh, really?  

B.46:  -- quite a bit of furor, yeah.  

A.47:  Interesting, quit on general principle?  

B.48:  I guess, yeah, there was some people that just actually quit because of
the, their, uh, objection to the policy being --

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  -- forced on them, you know.  

A.51:  Uh-huh, is there some concern that the tests may not be completely
accurate, that you might be taking some prescription medication and --

B.52:  Uh,

A.53:  -- #be interpreted correctly?# 

B.54:  #I don't know how much# of that there is.  I don't think it's that big of
an issue because they've hired a national company and it's, you know, handled
third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that.

A.55:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Do you know if anyone's been, uh, [lipsmack] uh,
disciplined or,

B.56:  Oh, yes, they've, they've, they've been people that have been, uh, the
company has a, you get a two-step process.  The first time if you're caught,
you have to, uh, take a, uh, you know go into a program to, even if you're
not, you know, still have to go into a program even,

A.57:  So even if it's, you know, one time,

B.58:  Yeah, if you're, if you're, you're high, you know, if you fail the test --

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- whatever reason, you have to go in, into a program and, uh, course that
can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user, or whatever.

A.61:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

B.62:  Then, uh, after that first ti-, chance, then the second time it's automatic
termination so,

A.63:  Seems fair.  Certainly, if people are prepared for the fact that there's a
chance they're going to be tested, you think they'd be smart enough, if they
did have a problem, to eliminate [laughter] their use [laughter].

B.64:  Yeah, well, it's, it's almost become a, uh, non-topic any-,
