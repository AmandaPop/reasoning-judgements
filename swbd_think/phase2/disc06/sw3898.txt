===========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Gene [breathing].  So, it's nice to talk with you and, um, food is a
very intriguing thing.  Our lives are, are built around foods that we like
and, an-, nutritionally good for us.

B.2:  Yes, sir.

A.3:  What kind of dining out do you like?

B.4:  [Breathing] Well, there is two kinds.  One I guess I'd say is with my wife
where we enjoy, uh --

A.5:  Oh.

B.6:  -- oh, I guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant.  Uh, you know,
something nice.

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  And the other is with my whole family whom we, uh, go somewhere that the
kids will enjoy [breathing].  Uh, recently we have been hitting Pancho's up.
It's a local Mexican restaurant.

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  (( )) because they have got a good rate on, you know, good prices and
everything.

A.11:  Pancho's, that's,

B.12:  #Yeah.#

A.13:  #a new# one.  

B.14:  #Yeah,#

A.15:  #Uh-huh.#

B.16:  it's, it's a chain down he-, uh, it goes up into Colorado and down here.  I
don't know where else it is.  #What about you?#

A.17:  #We have# one called Chi Chi's in th-, in our area.

B.18:  Oh, yeah.

A.19:  And, uh, we had a restaurant called La Bamba but it's just, it closed
recently.  But Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think.  Isn't it Mexican?

B.20:  #I think,#

A.21:  #Do you# have it there?

B.22:  think it might be.  I've se-, I think I've seen it around.  #Yes, sir.#

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  #Yeah.#

A.25:  #Well,# I love Mexican food myself.

B.26:  Oh, do you?  Yeah.

A.27:  But you go ahead now [laughter].

B.28:  Oh, we, we do too.  We, uh, we enjoy Mexican food.

A.29:  [Throat_clearing].

B.30:  I'm just not impressed with the quality of it.  It's just primarily the
price that's, uh, satisfying at this point.  #But the kids,#

A.31:  #Is that right?#

B.32:  seem to enjoy it.

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  Uh, and, uh, let's see.  We've, uh, just recently discovered a super
restaurant down here but it's, uh, not part of a chain it's just an
individually owned seafood restaurant.  But the first one we've been to that,
uh, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had
that was, uh, not just really super.  It's nice to find a place like that.

A.35:  Oh, boy that is wonderful.

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  Well, I, I agree with you on that.  And I wa-, was really a seafood addict
myself.  I, I love crab meat in particular.

B.38:  Um.

A.39:  I, uh, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if
I [laughter] had to.

B.40:  Oh, boy.

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  Have you ever been to, uh, what is it, Original Book Binders in
Philadelphia?

A.43:  I, uh, know the name but I haven't been there.

B.44:  Uh, that's an old established, uh, restaurant.  I used to go there when I
was in college.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Where did you go to college?

B.46:  Uh, I went to the Naval Academy.

A.47:  Oh, the #((U S)),#

B.48:  #And we used to,#

A.49:  Naval Academy?

B.50:  we use to go up there on, uh, for football games sometimes.

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  And have some liberty.  And, yeah, we would go over there to, uh, pr-,
pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders I think it was, yes.

A.53:  I'll be darn.

B.54:  I haven't been back there in years.

A.55:  Well, we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out, but I'll just
make one comment that, uh, I just retired from Penn State, and, uh, all my
work has been in research for the Navy [laughter].

B.56:  Okay.  What area?

A.57:  Underwater acoustics.

B.58:  Is that right?  Did you have any dealings with the, uh, underwater sound
reference laboratory in Orlando, Florida?

A.59:  I have dealt with nearly all of the, all of the research laboratories that
the country has.

B.60:  Yes, sir.  My dad worked there for years, and years.

A.61:  Uh-huh.

B.62:  That's wh-, that's, uh, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando.  #So,#

A.63:  #Oh,# you grew up in Orlando.  Uh-huh.

B.64:  That's, uh, that's interesting, Well, I was in submarines.  Uh,

A.65:  Well, that's what I worked on.

B.66:  Okay, yeah, must have had some interesting, uh, assignments for you there.
Wh-, when did you retire?

A.67:  The end of last month.

B.68:  [Lipsmack] Well, great.  I'm sure you've seen some interesting developments
in acoustics.

A.69:  I certainly have [breathing].

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  So, wa-, I hate to, uh, I wish I could talk to you about that, uh, but, uh,
I guess we should continue on, uh,

B.72:  Okay. 

A.73:  Okay. 

B.74:  Right.  #Where's,#

A.75:  #How# do you like Chinese food?

B.76:  Oh, we, we do enjoy that.  Yes, sir.  Uh, I don't know if we are
particularly adventurous, we find something we like, uh, like cashew shrimp or
something that's got a good, uh, at a particular restaurant and then we
usually stick by it.  #But do you,#

A.77:  #Uh-huh.#

B.78:  What about you?

A.79:  Well, I, uh, enjoy the Szechuan type of, uh, Chinese food.

B.80:  Hot?

A.81:  Yes.

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:  Yep, uh, it's, uh, I, I do a lot of Chinese cooking myself.  I have in the
past.  I haven't done recently, but, uh, it's in the sweet and sour porks and
things like are just really delicious meals.

B.84:  Um.  Where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking?

A.85:  [Breathing]  Uh, just at home.

B.86:  Uh-huh.

A.87:  I, I enjoyed the food and I bought a lot of, uh, good cookbooks, and I've
been following through on that.  When you find the right cookbook, why it
works out.

B.88:  Uh-huh.  What's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food?

A.89:  [Breathing] Okay, well, that one's a good question.  Here it's right under
my nose if I can find it [laughter].  Oh, boy.

B.90:  I guess one of the things we've, uh, started avoiding is the, uh, run of
the mill chop suey and things like that.

A.91:  Yeah, #right.#

B.92:  #But we enjoy# trying, uh, different kinds of chicken or, uh, sh-, you
know, even, uh, shrimp, uh, dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant.

A.93:  One of th-, th-, this book I have is called CHINESE COOKING MADE EASY.  Uh,
[breathing] it's a paperback and I think it's by someone named Chang.  Yeah,
Isabelle Chang.

B.94:  Okay, thanks for that, uh, reference.

A.95:  Yeah, yeah.  I think you will enjoy that.

B.96:  Okay, good.  Yeah.

A.97:  Well, it certainly is nice talking with you Gene.  And, uh, what is your
phone at home?
