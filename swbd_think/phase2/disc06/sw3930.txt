============================================================

B.1:   Okay.  Hello?  

A.2:   Hello.  

B.3:   Yeah, #okay#.  

@A.4:  #Yeah#.  Yeah, well I, uh, on capital punishment here in Utah
it, uh, and we do have the death penalty for murder and, uh, the
[lip_smack] uh, th-, either the jury or the judge can make that
determination depending on the crime, the seriousness of the crime. 

B.5:   Uh-huh.   

A.6:   It's been, uh, oh, it's been four or five years ago
since, uh, someone was actually, uh, put on Death Ro-, well,
there's some, quite a few on Death Row but, uh, before one was
executed.  

B.7:   Yeah, that's the same way it is here.  

A.8:   And it, uh, we've got some that, uh, have been there for ten
or fifteen years, and I don't know.  My opinion on, on, uh, the
death penalty I think it's, uh, n-, personally I think it would be
a deterrent if, uh, they were able to carry this out without many
appeals, but they appeal and appeal and uh, it just goes on
forever but ... 

B.9:   Right, right.  it's just nothing but cost the taxpayers lots
of money, #huh?#  

A.10:   #Uh-huh.#  It really does.  And, uh, uh, I, I have, I've always
felt that, uh, if they murder someone in cold, uh, in cold blood,
they know what they're doing, and, uh, that they should be, uh, ma-, made to pay for it.  But if we don't have a deterrent of
some kind, then it just gets to the point where, uh, people, it's
just, if they want to do it, they do it and then they, they think
well I'll be out in, uh, two or three years and a lot of them are
and ...  

B.11:   Yeah, and then they end up doing it again.  

A.12:   Uh-huh.  Right.  

B.13:   No.  I think that's very, very, very wrong.  Um, I'm with you. 
I think if they, if they've killed somebody, they should, they
should pay for it.  

A.14:   Uh-huh.  

B.15:   You know, period.  No, you know, none of this going on and on and on 
and on.

A.16:   [cough]  Where it's so clear cut we've had a couple cases here
where they were actually caught and, they, uh, and they had
witnesses where they had killed two or three people, and there was
one that they thought they had killed but they hadn't, and they had
the witness and, and, uh, they did all kinds of things to these
poor people.  

B.17:   Uh-huh.  

A.18:   And this one they thought they had killed him but, uh, they
hadn't, and the, the police were able to get them.  But they did,
uh, were able to, uh, have the one, uh, executed but the other one is 
still appealing and, uh, it's, uh, really a sad thing. Especially for 
the families of all that were involved.  

B.19:   Yeah, you know, I don't, in other countries I don't think they
do that.  If someone does something bad like that they just -- 

A.20:   Uh-huh.  

B.21:   -- do it right now, you know. 

A.22:   Right, and, and they don't have the crime rate that we have
here.  I know my son, uh, was over in Saudi Arabia.  

B.23:   #Uh-huh.#

A.24:   #But,# he was over there during the war and he said, man 
somebody over there, uh, they, they kill someone and the, and,
uh, that's it.  They're killed or ... 

B.25:   Yeah, #they# --

A.26:   #they#

B.27:   -- pay for it right #now#.  

A.28:   #Right#. 

B.29:   #Yeah.#  

A.30:   #And# so he says you really don't have, that he could see,
the crime rate was very low over there because people knew the
consequences.  

B.31:   Right.  

A.32:   But here it's got to the point where I think it's gone too far
the other way.  

B.33:   Yeah, you know, li-, like you say, you know, anything they do
they don't care.  They could go out and rob somebody.  If they get
caught, they know they're just going to be out in just a little
while #anyhow.#  

A.34:   #Uh-huh.#  That's true.  

B.35:   So it's the same thing, you know, but, uh, I just don't think
that they should let it go on and on and on #like they do.#  

A.36:   #((Well I know, made in the))# point you made about the taxpayer
paying for it when you start considering the cost of fifty to sixty
thousand dollars a year to keep them in prison.  

B.37:   Yeah, right.  

A.38:   Plus all the attorney costs.  [cough]  All of that the
taxpayers pay for.  

B.39:   Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.40:   And, uh, the victims they don't get anything other than just
the heartache and going through this and going through it appeal
after appeal, and I don't know I ... 

B.41:   Yeah, they make it wait for so long and then people forget
actually what did happen, #you know.# 

A.42:   #Uh-huh.#  And then they find some little glitch, uh, in the
law and, uh, you either turn them loose or, or put them in prison
for life and then maybe after a few years they're paroled.  

B.43:   Yeah, right.  Right.  

A.44:   So I don't know it's, it's, #uh,# 

B.45:   #[throat_clearing]# 

A.46:   quite a situation I --

B.47:   #Yeah#.  

A.48:   -- #[cough]# I wish they'd get back to that but, uh, every once in
a while there was a fellow that was executed in, uh, Wyoming, the
state next to us, uh, about a month ago.  

B.49:   Uh-huh.  

A.50:   And, uh, of course, he, he said he wanted to be because he, he
had done the, you know, he, he admitted to it and everything.  He
said, I just don't want to stay in prison and so the lawyers
couldn't do anything to stop that one. #[laughter]# 

B.51:   #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#  

A.52:   But anyway it's uh, #I#... 

B.53:   #It# makes you wonder how they can live with themselves when
they do something like that, huh?  

A.54:   Well it does.  And then you try to teach your children respect 
for, for uh ...
