=========================================================================

A.1:  You say you're a Steeler fan?

B.2:  Uh, yeah, not as much as I used to be.  I, I grew up in Pittsburgh.

A.3:  So did I.

B.4:  Did you?

A.5:  No kidding.

B.6:  Yeah, I left there, I went to school out that way, that, about forty miles
east of Pittsburgh, and then, uh, I left in the mid sixties, and right after I
left, well, a few years later, they started having some good teams.

A.7:  Yeah, Chuck Moe, as a matter-of-fact, uh, did the coin flip in, uh --

B.8:  Yeah.

A.9:  -- yesterday's Super Bowl.

B.10:  Yeah, he's looking good.  He's sixty, I think and, 

A.11:  He looks real good.

B.12:  Yeah [laughter] considering.

A.13:  He certainly had a, an unfortunate, uh, end to a brilliant career.

B.14:  Yeah, they just, uh, I don't know what happened.  They just weren't getting
any draft picks and weren't, I guess they just weren't picking the right guy.
(( )).

A.15:  Well, that's what I think.  I think the, the, the sad thing about the
Steelers is that they stuck with the crew --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- a little too long --

B.18:  Right.

A.19:  -- and I think that's the, the biggest problem for dynasties is that you
just really have to cycle people --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- um,

B.22:  Yeah, they, uh,

A.23:  [Throat_clearing].

B.24:  he wasn't alone. There's a lot of those guys that helped, uh, helped him
win those Super Bowls in the seventies and, uh, stuck with him too long, and
then I think that, the draft, uh, picks did fall on hard times, and they just
never were able to get back to where they were.

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  But, uh, uh, we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years, and I've
never become a Cowboys fan.

A.27:  No?

B.28:  In fact I don't, I just don't like them at all.  But,

A.29:  Yeah.

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  How about Houston?  The Oilers any more appealing to?

B.32:  Well, I like them better than the Cowboys.  I don't, I just, uh, other than
the Steelers, I don't have a real, a real favorite.  Uh, like the Eagles, like
the Redskins, but, uh, usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing --

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  -- for the most part.  You're a Forty-niner fan?

A.35:  Well, I, you know, I was a Steeler fan and a Forty-niner fan.  Um, they've
certainly built themselves a, you know, a great team.  As a matter-of-fact if
they hadn't lost so many games early in the season --

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  -- I think they might have been a contender, might have given Washington a
game.

B.38:  Yeah, well, (( )).

A.39:  But, uh, they lost, uh, so many games early that they, that their comeback
made little difference at the end.

B.40:  Yeah, they weren't the same without Montana.

A.41:  Well, Montana made a difference, but as the ana-, analysts have said over
and over again, the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage.  A smart
quarterback makes a big difference, and I really think, for example,
yesterday, Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley
been, uh, a smarter quarterback.

B.42:  (( )).

A.43:  I, I frankly am surprised that, um, Marv Levy would allow him to call all
those plays.

B.44:  Was he calling the plays?  (( )).

A.45:  Yeah, and I think that's just too tough in a, on a --

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  -- uh, uh, you know, a guy, you got to be real, real savvy to do that, and
I don't see Kelley as being that savvy.

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  I don't, I think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense,
myself --

B.50:  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a,

A.51:  -- because they certainly have a heck of a defense --

B.52:  Um.

A.53:  -- although it was picked apart a little bit.  I mean, Washington just
looked phenomenal.

B.54:  Right, yeah.

A.55:  And, uh,

B.56:  Well, couple of those passes, couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped
some important, uh --

A.57:  Yeah.

B.58:  -- passes, too.  They, it would have made, might have made a little bit of
a difference, #not much# --

A.59:  #Yeah.#

B.60:  -- but, uh, uh, I don't, I, I just looked in the paper this, this evening
and trying to figure out when the last time the A F C won a game.  Guess it
was eighty-four.

A.61:  It's, it's --

B.62:  Raiders. 

A.63:  -- it's nine years ago.

B.64:  Raiders beat, uh, the Redskins, I think, as a matter-of-fact.
 
A.65:  Yeah --

B.66:  But boy, it's,

A.67:  -- it's be-, been a while.

B.68:  I was thinking maybe they, uh, ought to just, A F C ought to just give it
up and, uh, when, uh, it comes time for the Super Bowl, the N F C champ plays
an All Star team of the A F C teams.

A.69:  #[Laughter].#

B.70:  #It might be a little more# interesting, because I'm getting a little tired
of (( )) watching the blow-outs, and, uh,

A.71:  Well, it is, it is a little disappointing, and there's some, it's, it's
very interesting to see, you know, what's, what's behind this. Is it, is it
the, uh, I mean, you would think theoretically that the draft picks would, 
uh --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- you know, random and then free agency also makes a big difference.

B.74:  Right.

A.75:  And I don't understand it.  I mean, they just --

B.76:  (( )).

A.77:  -- uh, they, they, Denver, you know, went a few times, and they didn't do
anything, Cincinnati, they didn't do anything.

B.78:  Yeah.

A.79:  Now, uh, Buffalo.

B.80:  Now Buffalo twi-, well, they did get close last year.  They could have won,
Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants.  But, uh, just seems like
there's a big gap in talent between the, or maybe in coaching between the A F
C and the N F C, because it's, like I said, it's been nine years, or eight
years since they, uh, since A F C -s won a game.

A.81:  Yeah.

B.82:  But, uh, I guess they're going to, somebody was saying, uh, I was watching
the game with some people, they were saying that instant replay may be on its
way out.  I guess they have enough votes to, uh, or not enough votes to keep
it going.

A.83:  Well, you know, I think that's sad in a way, because I think, that if you
look, for example, there were a couple of calls yesterday that were
#appallingly# --

B.84:  #Uh-huh.#

A.85:  -- bad --

B.86:  Yeah.

A.87:  -- I mean, I just, it's, it's --

B.88:  Yeah.

A.89:  -- it's shameful, and, and I think that, that once Pandora's out of the
box, you know, so I don't know.  I, I, I think it can complicate things.  I
recognize --

B.90:  Yeah.

A.91:  -- that, but I sure think it's, it's reversed some, some calls that were
bad calls --

B.92:  Yeah.

A.93:  -- although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call.

B.94:  I just don't like it.  It, it delays the game.  It delays, uh, I don't
know, it, it just kind of inter-, interrupts the flow of things, and, uh,

A.95:  Well, there, yeah, there is that problem, and, and, but, uh, I guess that
[laughter] that the real, the real interesting thing is in the age of
television, you're going to get so much analysis of it, that a --

B.96:  Uh-huh.

A.97:  -- that a game really, for example, yesterday, when, when Andre Reid,
