=========================================================================

A.1:  You been doing in your house?  

B.2:  Uh, well, since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in
there.

A.3:  Yeah {very faint}.

B.4:  I had to do most of it since, uh, my wife was working.  

A.5:  Where you live?  

B.6:  Uh, Austin.  

A.7:  Austin, okay, great.  

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  Well we,

B.10:  And g-, getting ready around here to do some, uh, major yard work as soon
as the weather turns a little bit nicer.

A.11:  Yeah, as soon as it stops raining a little bit, huh.  

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  Yeah.

B.14:  Well, actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and
get started, but [breathing] --

A.15:  Yeah, great.  

B.16:  -- I'd just be wasting my time.  

A.17:  Have you done much, uh, much in the way of home repairs?  

B.18:  Uh, I've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that
except maybe I don't do heaters and air conditioners, but --

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  

B.20:  -- I usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and
things.

A.21:  Great, how old a house do you have?  

B.22:  Uh, this house is, was built in, probably, the mid-seventies. 

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  It's kind of a brick ranch [inhaling].  S-, not a whole lot needs to be
done to it.  We've only, we only moved here about a year ago.

A.25:  Oh, yeah, yeah, great.  

B.26:  What about you?  What kind of house you live in?  

A.27:  Oh, well, right now we're not.  We're living in a travel trailer, but, uh,
we've, we've just moved here to Dallas, uh, recently and we're living in that
until we can find a place, but, uh, we lived in a brick homes in, uh, in
Louisiana before this and did some, uh, various kinds of things, uh, made some
storm windows to put up and, uh, uh, really did a major rejob on the inside
of the house, uh, put up some walls and, uh, put in a bathroom and stuff like
that so,

B.28:  About two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville, which is like
forty miles east of Austin --

A.29:  Uh-huh.

B.30:  -- over toward Houston, uh, little old stucco house built in nineteen
twenty-one --

A.31:  Oh, yeah.  

B.32:  -- and, uh, we bought it t-, g-, for a weekend getaway and it needs a lot
of work, but we saw it, when we first looked at it, we can do this and, uh,
sure enough, uh, it's, oh, nineteen months later, we sold it for twenty-six
and we bought it for sixteen, five.

A.33:  Wow, that's pretty good.  

B.34:  And we did things like paint, uh, inside and outside and basically repaired
the garages, we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my
part, but it was something I thought the place needed because it had real high
ceilings and, uh, just, and just, in general did everything.  We, uh, put in a
hot water heater, a new toilet.

A.35:  Oh, yeah.  

B.36:  Things like that, kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets.  

A.37:  Uh-huh, do you think it was worth, uh, the ceiling fans on your resale?

B.38:  Well, [breathing] we weren't th-, talking about reselling it when we
started doing it.  We were looking for something to do on weekends.

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  And it, because my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment.  And if it
doesn't work, try another color,

A.41:  [Laughter].

B.42:  things like that.  So, but, when the offer came to us, it was from a
neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them and we thought, well, you
know, we're not, we hadn't been out here but, what, once in three months and,
and we had just bought this house in Austin, so --

A.43:  Yeah.  

B.44:  -- we thought, well, what the heck, let's make a little money on it
[laughter].

A.45:  Sure, well, so, you think you'll do it again some time?  

B.46:  Yeah, I'd like to, uh, we have bought new homes in the past and, and we'll
never do that again,

A.47:  [Laughter].

B.48:  because it was just boring for, after about a week.  

A.49:  Is that right?  

B.50:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.51:  Yeah.

B.52:  So,

A.53:  Um.

B.54:  Uh, out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down, oh, terribly
run down home and, uh, it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make
almost forty-five thousand in profit on it.

A.55:  Uh-huh.  

B.56:  And that was,

A.57:  Yeah, it sounds like you've got a good bit of experience in that.

B.58:  Yeah, uh, it's just, you know, we map out what we want to do and we go for
it.

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  Uh, whoever's got time to do it and, course, you get the major things done,
like, your, you know, have the floors redone or have carpet put it whatever.
But the rest of it we usually do ourselves.

A.61:  Sure.  We're thinking about possibly building a house now.  We aren't real
sure whether we're going to be able to do that or not, but we just talked to a
builder today, as a matter of fact that, you know, just, uh, beginning to
think about sketching out some plans and talked about some of the different,
uh, ways to go on, you know, different things.

B.62:  Yeah.  I, uh, I think about that from time to time because we've never
actually, you know, built one that we wanted, you know, the way we wanted it
and things like that, but, I'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it
to do something like that.

A.63:  Yeah, it sounds like you're, uh, really into, uh, remodeling what --

B.64:  Yeah.  

A.65:  -- you get.  

B.66:  Reno-, renovation is kind of where we're at.  Like our, our favorite T V
program is THIS OLD HOUSE.  Has been for --

A.67:  Yeah [laughter].  

B.68:  -- many years.  

A.69:  Okay.  

B.70:  And we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it.

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  Uh, then again, we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home
[laughter].

A.73:  Oh, yeah.  

B.74:  And, because they're so, it's a town that time has passed by, so there are
a lot of old, big homes and they're fairly inexpensive.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  So,

A.77:  How far away from Austin is it?  

B.78:  It's forty miles.  

A.79:  Oh, yeah. 

B.80:  Uh, it's on the, it's on the river and it's quite nice little town.
They've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things.  I mean, there's
no K-Marts or anything like that around so,

A.81:  Oh, yeah.  

B.82:  Makes it kind of nice.  

A.83:  Ever, are you, uh, looking to get,
