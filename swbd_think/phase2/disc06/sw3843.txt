============================================================================

A.1:  do you think, do we spend enough on that or,

B.2:  Probably not, from what I've been hearing, I mean, #there's not enough# --

A.3:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.4:  -- getting done.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I just kind of wonder, uh, you know, I've been thinking, I
don't know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and
some of those other things, but it seems like, uh, you know, it needs to be
somewhat equitable, I guess --

B.6:  Yeah.

A.7:  -- as far as the number of people that are affected.  Uh, cancer seems to
affect a lot more people, and you'd think they need to spend more on that
but,

B.8:  Well, you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty
--

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- and I would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- in treatment, and then again, I guess there is, #I mean# --

A.13:  #Uh-huh.#

B.14:  -- there's some drugs that they didn't have and, I'm sure that didn't come
cheap.

A.15:  Yeah, that's true.  And still, I don't know, it's kind of interesting, ((
)), you wonder, now it's gotten so out of hand that, you know, it's not just
the homosexual population and stuff like that.  Uh, you know, it's affected
everybody, just, even if you go to a hospital, it's kind of #hard to# --

B.16:  #Yeah.#

A.17:  -- know what to do, and, #you really, I don't even# --

B.18:  #It's pretty, uh.#

A.19:  -- think they really a decent idea of how many people really have it.  I
would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and, #(( )).#

B.20:  #Yeah,# I keep thinking that myself.

A.21:  It's kind of,

B.22:  I, I last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they
said it costed, you know, like seventy billion or #something# --

A.23:  #Uh-huh.#

B.24:  -- and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could
have found, found a cure.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  So I kind of wondered about that.

A.27:  Yeah, whether (( )).

B.28:  To me that's an astronomical amount of money [laughter] --

A.29:  Yeah, seventy.

B.30:  -- and, uh, but it suddenly comes from somewhere, I don't know where it
comes from but,

A.31:  Yeah, and you just wonder how, you know, I look at kind of now, too, where
we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country, you know,
or to support the Soviet Union, this, that and the other, and, you know, I
sometimes wonder if it's not time we started, you know, maybe turning some of
that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems, and, you
know, AIDS being --

B.32:  Yeah.

A.33:  -- one of them, to, I think, didn't the President put, I don't know if it
was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this, well, I
guess it was in ninety-one, to try and find a cure for it or,

B.34:  There again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- you know, if, to do something like that with,

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  Uh, but I, I kind of agree with you, we should spend more in this country
for not only AIDS but a lot of other things --

A.39:  Yeah.

B.40:  -- before we start helping other countries.

A.41:  Well, it's kind of, kind of ironic ourselves, we're on the down trend and
here we are --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- trying to still pick other people up and seems like that's all we ever
do, and it comes back to haunt us in the long run [laughter].

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  But.

B.46:  I mean, in, in, in your own financial budget, if, if you're not doing well,
you're not going to help out anyone else.

A.47:  Yeah, yeah, it's true, I mean, that you might, that you want to try and
reach out a little bit, yet you got to take care of your own house and put
your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and,

B.48:  But, but that's not the way this country is, or ever been.  I think we've
always --

A.49:  Yeah I,

B.50:  -- they had reasons for it.  I think I heard one just the other day, that
because of all the money he was, you know, giving away right now --

A.51:  Uh-huh.

B.52:  -- uh, the president was, I think his wife said something with, well we've
got to keep these countries in a democratic mode and --

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  -- uh, sometimes I don't think it matters.

A.55:  No, and, and yeah, I, I, I agree that, just, and, and like I say, what do
we really get out of it a lot of times, you know, I guess, if we didn't help
the Soviet Union, there could be just total chaos and go back to the old
order, but, you know, we're either paying for it in weapons and arms or we're
paying, we're giving it to them for nothing, you know --

B.56:  Yeah.

A.57:  -- and then we, you know, at least we have jobs when we're making all the
weapons and stuff, it seemed like, and now we don't even have those, because
we cut back so much, and then we give it away, and, you just wonder what we
really get [laughter] out of it [talking].

B.58:  My wife and I used to work at a research laboratory for the government --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and I know things go slow --

A.61:  Yeah.

B.62:  -- an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing
sometimes --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- so I understand, you know, where the money gets ate up at, and but there
really should just be more #and now that# --

A.65:  #More money spent?#

B.66:  -- yeah, and now that they're, you know, the weapon spending is going down
--

A.67:  Uh-huh.

B.68:  -- but we could put some of these laboratories, even like the one we worked
at, at Los Alamos --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- put them onto, you know, more AIDS things.

A.71:  Yeah.  Well, uh, do you know that much about, I mean, have you ever met
anybody that has AIDS or,

B.72:  Not that I know of.

A.73:  Yeah, I've never met anybody myself but,

B.74:  I think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street, and I
heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS.

A.75:  Uh-huh.

B.76:  But I never knew for sure.  I met them once or twice because they used to
sell plants in the yard, but --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- I never really considered that I knew them.  So.

A.79:  Yeah.  Just more passing, but --

B.80:  Yeah.

A.81:  -- yeah, I just, I haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit
me as bad as some-, you know, you tend to sometimes wonder, well, hey, you
know, you kind of brought it on yourself, but like I say, now it's getting so
much more in, into society that people that, you know, have no intention of
doing anything, you know, kind of end up with it, and, you know, little kids
and stuff like that, that --

B.82:  Yeah.

A.83:  -- that is, it's and I say I don't have any idea how much, and there ought
to be probably a lot more spent to, to find out.  I just, I just hope they
kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other, you
know, type diseases out there.  It seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS
activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and,

B.84:  Well, ac-,
