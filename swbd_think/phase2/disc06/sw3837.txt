=============================================================================

A.1:  Well, have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately?

@B.2:  Yes, took one in October, and, uh, dr-, flew into Los Angeles and drove up
the coast to, uh, through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe,
and flew out of Reno.

A.3:  Okay, so you went up like the Coast Highway --

B.4:  Yeah.

A.5:  -- the freeways and then, then went inland there.

B.6:  Uh-huh.  Was really great.

A.7:  Is, is that, was that a new area for you to visit?

B.8:  Most of it was, because I had, uh, seen parts of northern California, and
I'd been to San Francisco, but never along the Coast Road.

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  It was quite exciting.  My husband said he didn't know whether he wanted to
ever drive it again, though.

A.11:  [Laughter]  #It's sce-,#

B.12:  #Have you been?#

A.13:  It's scenic I guess.  I, I've, I've been to a part of that, on a trip to
San Francisco I, I went up just a short ways up the coast to I believe it was
Point (( )), uh, National Seashore, I think it was.

B.14:  Um, I don't remember that.

A.15:  And I only had about a day, so --

B.16:  Oh.

A.17:  -- it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when I was out,
out for business.

B.18:  Well, we went, uh, we liked Monterey very much, and, uh, it was just kind
of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do, and, and then,
uh, the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco, that's another really
bad drive, but it's, it's worth going to.

A.19:  Uh, the, the Redwood forest there?

B.20:  Yes.

A.21:  What part of the country are you from?

B.22:  Originally from Texas. I was raised up in Dalhart, so, uh, anything that
doesn't look like flat plains is, uh, like I told someone once, I always
thought Dallas was real green,

A.23:  [Laughter].

B.24:  because it was the greenest place I'd ever been.

A.25:  Are you currently living in Texas?

B.26:  Oh, yes, live in Dallas.

A.27:  Okay, see, I'm in Texas, too, but,

B.28:  Where are you fr-, where do you live?

A.29:  In Richardson.

B.30:  Okay, well, you're just a, [throat_clearing] a suburb of Dallas.

A.31:  That's right.  

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  Well, we, uh, my family and I moved here about three years ago.

B.34:  Oh.

A.35:  We lived in Colorado, and --

B.36:  Oh, my.

A.37:  -- and that's a good vacation spot, too [laughter].

B.38:  Yes, yes.

A.39:  But it was nice living there.

B.40:  Well, we, uh, when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park.

A.41:  Yes, I, I didn't live too far from there, in fact --

B.42:  Oh.

A.43:  -- I bicycled from my house to there a time or two, uh --

B.44:  How fortunate you were.

A.45:  -- uh, from Boulder.  I lived in Boulder, Colorado.

B.46:  Yeah, uh-huh.  That's, that is one beautiful place.

A.47:  Uh, I, I, uh, didn't probably take advantage of it as much as I probably
would if I moved back [laughter].

B.48:  Yeah.

A.49:  You kind of take it for granted when you live there, but --

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  -- I did enjoy the skiing, and, and the --

B.52:  Um.

A.53:  -- and the winter sports that, that was available there.

B.54:  Well, I've never skied.  My husband keeps saying we need to go, but, uh, we
have never done it yet, but, uh, everyone who does says it's great.

A.55:  Yeah, it's enjoyable if you do it more than once or twice so you get past
the learning stage --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- so you can start enjoying it.  It's a little bit frustrating when you're
falling a lot.

B.58:  [Laughter].

A.59:  But after [laughter], after you get past that it's a lot of fun.

B.60:  You have to enjoy the cold snow in your face, huh.

A.61:  Well, it sometimes can be, yeah, it, it, uh, you can get some nice days
skiing as well though if --

B.62:  Uh-huh.

A.63:  -- if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry [laughter].

B.64:  [Laughter] Yeah.

A.65:  And it can be pretty nice, the dry climate --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- doesn't feel near as cold as, as it does here in the winter time --

B.68:  Uh-huh.

A.69:  -- to me.

B.70:  Yeah, well, I think that, uh, no, the dampness, course our humidity is sort
of medium compared, uh, well where I was raised is extremely dry.

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  But my brother lives in Houston and,

A.73:  You see the other extreme.

B.74:  Yeah.  So we're kind of in-between but, uh, my mother always said that
Dallas was extremely humid to her.

A.75:  Yeah, it's, I, I agree with you, it's sort of in between.  Yeah, after
having lived in Colorado a lot, that was a little dryer than was probably
comfortable.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  It's a bit, little too dry, and, and this is actually a pretty good
climate, humidity wise --

B.78:  Uh-huh.

A.79:  -- in, in the Dallas area.

B.80:  Have you gone on any vacations lately?

A.81:  Last, uh, uh, summer we, uh, we went, uh, and took the family to Cancun --

B.82:  Oh, yeah.

A.83:  -- in Mexico, and, uh, we really enjoyed that trip.

B.84:  Have they, uh, we were, we were there when it, one of the first times it
was open, they were just building the hotels and,

A.85:  Well, it's pretty built up now.

B.86:  I was afraid it had become so commercialized.

A.87:  Yeah, it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too, too
built, it's it's a real strip, hotel strip now --

B.88:  Uh-huh.

A.89:  -- out on that island.

B.90:  Did you go over to the Isle Mujeres?

A.91:  Uh, yes, we, we took a sailboat, uh --

B.92:  Um.

A.93:  -- catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres, and they took us around, let us
shop a little while --

B.94:  Yeah.

A.95:  -- and then took us to some snorkeling, uh --

B.96:  Oh, #did# --

A.97:  -- #spots,#

B.98:  -- you get to go out to that reef?
