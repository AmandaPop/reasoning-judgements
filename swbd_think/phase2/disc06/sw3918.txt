B.60:  Yeah.

A.61:  But I am real excited about that.

B.62:  Well, th-, southern California and northern California are pretty different
except that once you are on the coast of course it, I mean being on the coast
is just beautiful.

A.63:  Yeah. That's,

B.64:  But, but I, but I suggest some time you try to get up to San Francisco.
It's just incredibly beautiful.  That whole area.

A.65:  Really?

B.66:  And driving, if you drive, if you go from San Francisco and drive north up
the Pacific --

A.67:  Uh-huh.

earthquakes --

A.103:  Oh no.

did get a little bit tired of of the earth quakes.  They haven't had one in a
while, but they had them while he was there.

A.105:  Really.

B.106:  So when he was in southern California they had them and then he went to
visit San Francisco and was there for the big earthquake #there too.#

A.107:  #Oh.  That# would be scary.

B.108:  On his spring break [laughter].

A.109:  That would be really scary.

it comes with that.  That and the smog.

A.111:  Yeah.
