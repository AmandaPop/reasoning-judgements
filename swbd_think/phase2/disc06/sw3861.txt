======================================================================

B.1:  [Beep] Uh-oh.  Are you still there?

A.2:  Yes, I'm still here.

B.3:  Oh, I know what it was, the answering machine must have run out of
[laughter],

A.4:  [Laughter] Well that,

B.5:  I heard something click, and I was like, oh, no, it disconnected us.

A.6:  No, I think, I think it's on.  I'm, I'm so glad I got hold of you.  I want,
um, something came up at work the other day.  People are wondering how to
choose a college --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- and I was wondering, how, what did your parents do to help you choose a
college?

@B.9:  Well, to be honest, they didn't really do a lot.  I mean, my dad sat me
down, I guess in junior high, and said, um, that, I guess they had called him
from the school and, you know, when they start giving you all those
standardized tests and everything, and, you know, Dad said, well, you know,
you're a smart kid, so you're going to college and you're going to graduate
school.  So decide now, what do you want to be.

A.10:  [Laughter].

B.11:  Here, here are your choices.  You can be a doctor, a lawyer, an architect,
uh, he gave me a list of choices, all, you know, the different professions,
and I was kind of like, I didn't even know, you know,

A.12:  [Laughter].

B.13:  I had no clues.  So I said, uh, well, I can't stand the sight of blood, so
a doctor is out, and, uh, I'm not, I can't do math, so a lot of stuff is out,
um, I didn't think I'd be a very good architect because I like to draw, but
not that way, so I said, well, I guess I'll be a lawyer, because I think they
help people [laughter].  Boy, was I stupid.

A.14:  [Laughter].

B.15:  So Dad said, okay fine.  You're going to be a lawyer.  So then when it got
time to, you know, get close to, you know, you start getting college brochures
and stuff, [throat_clearing] my dad kind of said, well, uh, what's the best
law school in the country.  And all his friends told him Harvard.  And he
goes, okay, well, I think you should go there for undergraduate too.

A.16:  [Laughter].

B.17:  So, like, okay fine.  So, I like, uh, send them the, uh, you know, do the,
what do you call it, you know, send for the --

A.18:  Oh.

B.19:  -- things you fill out, and filled out the forms, and, um, they interview
you.  They always have one of their alums interview you.  And at the time I
applied you had to do it through Radcliff, because, used to, Harvard was for
the boys and Radcliff #was for the girls.#

A.20:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.21:  And even though they were combined, you know, even though they had to let
women in Harvard, you still had to apply through Radcliff, so, I did all this,
and, uh, a Radcliff alum here in Dallas did my interview, and basically
Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system.  And they
told me that I was provisionally accepted, but that if they got a black
person, or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area,
that I would be bumped, because I'm just a basic, you know --

A.22:  Oh.

B.23:  -- Wasp type person.  So, [throat_clearing] I'm not really, you know, they
had this minority recruitment thing.

A.24:  Huh.

B.25:  So, and sure enough about two weeks before school started I found out that
they had taken, uh, they, uh, found a black girl and, uh, took her instead.
So the only thing I could do was I had to go somewhere that you could pretty
much register and start the next day.  So University of Texas was where my dad
went to school, and luckily it's kind of that way.  So I went down there and
late registered and basically started classes the day after I registered.

A.26:  So you got to choose a college twice.

B.27:  Yeah, by myself [laughter].

A.28:  Good grief.

B.29:  I mean, my parents didn't really, you know, my dad was the first, well, my
mom, they were the first people in their families that had been to college,
which I know, like people from the east coast, colleges are all around you,
you know --

A.30:  Yeah.

B.31:  -- and so everybody goes to college, or it's more normal I think, because a
lot of my friends that are from the east coast, you know, everybody in their
family's been to college.  But out here, you know, in fact my mother hasn't
really been to college college.  They had a junior college --

A.32:  Yeah.

B.33:  -- that was fairly close by, and, and so she, that's all she ever did was
go to junior college.

A.34:  Um.

B.35:  Just, you know, two year college --

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  -- and, and got her degree.  But, you know, then my dad went back to school
and finished school and went to professional school, but that was after my
brother and I were already little kids.  So nobody in my family really knew
how to advise me.

A.38:  That was the same way in, in my family.  Of course, my parents were
divorced, so it was just mother and my grandparents.  But, one of the key
things then was what could we afford to do.

B.39:  Oh, yeah.

A.40:  And I got a, a co-op deal at one of the schools in New Mexico, and I was
there for a couple of years before I flunked out [laughter].

B.41:  Well, where did you go to school in New Mexico?

A.42:  New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology,

B.43:  [Cough] [throat_clearing]. 

A.44:  and that choice.

B.45:  I bet that was neat.

A.46:  Yeah, it was, but men out women, numbered the women about twenty or thirty
to one.

B.47:  Wow.

A.48:  But, uh, it was just a very small school, about three hundred students, but
the big, the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was
available.

B.49:  Yeah.  

A.50:  #And it,# 

B.51:  #That is# really critical these days, #I think,# 

A.52:  #Yeah,# yeah.  But then I, my next choice in college, was, hey, I move back
wi-, home with mom and I, I went to the local university to get my grade point
back up [laughter] --

B.53:  Oh, yeah.

A.54:  -- so a decent school would let me in.

B.55:  [Throat_clearing].
