========================================================================

A.1:  Um, what things are you looking for in a car?  What kind of car did you
buy?  #For your next purchase.#

@B.2:  #Well, right# now I have a, uh, small Toyota Tercel --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and I think next time I want something just a little bit bigger.  Uh,
perhaps midsize.  I really don't, don't like the, the real big cars.  I'm
thinking about maybe a Volvo.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  Well, it's funny, because I currently also have a Toyota Tercel.

B.6:  You do?

A.7:  Um, when I first got married, my, my father gave me and my wife a, a, a
used Toyota, um, Corolla --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- and we used that until we, until it's about run into the ground, and
then we, um, bought a used, um, Toyota Tercel.  I was still a student at the
time --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and, um, so, um, we bought what we could afford.

B.12:  Right.

A.13:  And, I think definitely, um, now we would also get a, a larger car.

B.14:  Uh-huh.  How did your, uh, Corolla hold up?

A.15:  Oh, very well.  

B.16:  Um.

A.17:  Um, it, um, did very well, #I mean.#

B.18:  #Uh-huh.# Do you remember how many miles you had on it at the end?

A.19:  Uh, yeah, it was about a hundred and fifty thousand, and it may have gone
further, but, um, it was very reliable #but# --

B.20:  #Uh-huh.#

A.21:  -- for us, though.  #Um.#

B.22:  #My,# my Tercel now has a hundred and forty-six thousand miles on it --

A.23:  Uh-huh.

B.24:  -- and I really haven't had any trouble out of it, except the alternator
went out at about a hundred and twenty-six thousand miles, I think.

A.25:  Oh, that's to be expected --

B.26:  Right.

A.27:  -- I would think.

B.28:  Right.

A.29:  Hope-, hopefully just doesn't happen at a, a bad time, [laughter] I mean
when you're far away from anything or something.

B.30:  Right, and, um, it's really been great.  I have had no problems with it,
you know, except little, little minor things, like, you know, belts and (( )).

A.31:  Uh-huh.  Did you buy it new?

B.32:  Actually, I didn't, I bought it from, um, Hertz Rent A Car --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- and it had like twenty-six thousand miles on it [cough] when I bought
it.

A.35:  I see, but, well, sounds like it's been a good deal for you.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  Um, another thing I may consider, the main thing I look for in a car is
reliability --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- and, um, I just go by what my dad says.  He's a mechanic, and I remember
growing up and, and, but he's al-, never wanted to spend a lot on a car,
because I grew up in a fairly large family --

B.40:  Uh-huh.

A.41:  -- six kids, and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars.

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  So, um, I remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that,
and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed.  I mean, ours
broke down all the time.  Luckily my dad was a mechanic and he could fix them,
but I remember, he, he said he would never buy, um, a foreign car, but then,
in nineteen eighty, he bought a used Toyota Corolla --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- and, I mean, didn't even spend very much money for it, I don't think he
spent more than five hundred dollars for it --

B.46:  Wow.

A.47:  -- but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased.

B.48:  Right.

A.49:  And he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time.

B.50:  Wow.

A.51:  And so, um, but, I don't know, my feeling is that American cars, to keep up
at all, are becoming more reliable also, so I may consider buying, um, an
American made car --

B.52:  Yeah, I'm trying to consider #that, uh,# --

A.53:  -- #my next,# next purchase.

B.54:  -- that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that.  I'm
really trying, trying to consider [laughter], but I don't know, I, I, I don't
want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs.

A.55:  That's true [inhaling].  I have a cou-, yeah, one of my cousins is trying
to tell, convince me that, um, the American made cars are becoming reli-,
reliable, but, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure.  I just, I know, for example, that
both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good, um, and reliable, that, that
I've, I've used.

B.56:  Have you heard that, um, or do you know anything about the foreign cars
being easier to steal than the, uh, American cars?

A.57:  Oh.

B.58:  There's a lot of, of car theft going, going on in Dallas right now.  I
don't know about in your area.

@@A.59:  Huh.  I'm in Iowa City, Iowa, very small town, and I don't, I don't know
if there's even, whether, one or two a month, I [laughter] mean --

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  -- uh, that's, that's not a big consideration --

B.62:  (( )).

A.63:  -- here, and I just moved from Utah where, that's where I was going to
school before, and, um, also there, um, there's, I've never had that concern,
um, so, I'm not really, I'm not really sure,
