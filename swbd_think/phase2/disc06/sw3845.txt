=========================================================================

A.1:  Well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are, that are an
invasion of your privacy?

@B.2:  Well, the, uh, what I really, I don't like is the ca-, the constant calls,
people selling things --

A.3:  Oh.

B.4:  -- people telling me I want things.

A.5:  Right.

B.6:  You know, [breathing] people trying to solicit for different, you know,
organizations.  You know, that's what I really.

A.7:  Yeah, I think that's, that's the only thing I wrote down also, because
that's just a, it's terrible today, I mean, my wife and I, seems like we get
home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing --

B.8:  Never stops ringing, right.

A.9:  -- and rings up until ten, eleven o'clock sometimes.

B.10:  That's right.  Well, you know, the, the great, uh, thing for that, it's,
uh, is, is an answering machine [laughter].

A.11:  Yes, I know, that's true.

B.12:  I mean, this is, this is the, one of the best inventions ever, you know,

A.13:  [Laughter].

B.14:  you just switch that thing on, and, uh, [laughter].

A.15:  Yeah, that's true.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  But, you know, people, it's like your name must be on a list or something,
because I know at my office, I get calls, I mean, I must get at least, I
probably average at least a call a day, and a lot of days I'll get two and
three calls, from --

B.18:  Um, even in an office?

A.19:  -- from people selling insurance --

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- you know, to the small business man --

B.22:  Right.

A.23:  -- and, uh, you know, I think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your, according to
what I understand, Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names, your name out to
people also, as far as brokers all, I get calls from brokers in New York, and,
uh --

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  -- California, always trying to sell something, oil, oil investments or
#stock investments# --

B.26:  #Right, right.#

A.27:  -- or whatever.  And now I'm getting the same calls at ho-, at the house.

B.28:  Uh-huh, #I know.#

A.29:  #And they get your,# and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet, and,
uh, credit card companies, they sell your name.

B.30:  Oh, yeah, uh, well, you know, these people, they sell your names, #I 
mean# --

A.31:  #I know.#

B.32:  -- you know, I, that's also an invasion of privacy.  I think it --

A.33:  Yes.

B.34:  -- the whole thing is, uh,

A.35:  American Express does that, by the way.

B.36:  Oh, they do?

A.37:  Yeah, I understand they sell it, you know, they sell names because it's
quite profitable to them.

B.38:  Well, sure it is.

A.39:  And that is an invasion of privacy, you're right.

B.40:  That's right.  Well, you know, if you've ever gotten anything, you know, in
your life, your, your name is somewhere [laughter].

A.41:  I know, that's true.  

B.42:  I mean, one magazine, and boom, they got your name forever.

A.43:  Exactly, magazine companies, uh, uh, from, from subscriptions do the same
thing --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- it's the way they make additional money.

B.46:  That's right.

A.47:  But, it's, uh, you know, I guess, it, uh, you have to be a certain income
holder to, uh, have an American Express card, so your name is valuable to, I
guess, X amount of solicitors calling.

B.48:  Yeah, that's right.

A.49:  So, I don't know.  What, what do you, where are you from?

B.50:  Oh, I'm from Texas.

A.51:  Oh, okay, well so, yeah, we live in the Dallas area, #Richardson.#

B.52:  #Oh,# we're in Plano.

A.53:  Okay [laughter].

B.54:  [Laughter] Well, you know, the only call I really got that, well, was out
of state, I got one from Oklahoma City, and one from California.

A.55:  Did you?

B.56:  And that was, uh, California, I was thrilled to death, because that's, you
know, the furthest I'd gotten any call from, you know, and, um,

A.57:  Yeah, I got, I've talked to people in Utah, people in New York --

B.58:  Oh, really.

A.59:  -- and a lot of times I'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and
I'll get people --

B.60:  Oh.

A.61:  -- you know, from out of the, uh, out of the state.

B.62:  Yeah, see, well that's, uh, the, there was another call on Saturday,
Saturday that was also from, uh, that was the one from California.  I don't
know why I ask people on the weekends [laughter],

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  from out of state, or, uh, I don't know, #you know, but,#

A.65:  #I'll be darned.#  Where you from?  #Not from Texas.#

B.66:  #Uh, originally# from New Jersey.

A.67:  New Jersey, right. Yeah.

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  My wife's from New Jersey.

B.70:  Oh, really, what part?

A.71:  Yeah, from, uh, Saddle River.

B.72:  Oh, that's nice over there.  

A.73:  She,

B.74:  Yeah, we're from more, uh, from sort of towards the shore, #central# --

A.75:  #Okay.#

B.76:  -- New Jersey, you know, we're like, uh,

A.77:  Well, that's nice, too.

B.78:  Yeah, oh yeah, it was beautiful, that's why I, I really miss it.  I, I
don't really like it here at all [laughter].

A.79:  Really, yes, my wife's been away for twenty-five years, so she's been away
for quite a while.

B.80:  Uh-huh.

A.81:  Her dad was from Little Rock, Arkansas, and her mother was from New York,
so they just --

B.82:  Yeah, so they,

A.83:  -- they (( )) over there in New Jersey.

B.84:  Yeah [laughter].

A.85:  Uh, and anyway, this topic is, is a good topic, as far as invasion of your
privacy, but that's the, the biggest one I can think of is just, just #all the
solicitors calling.#

B.86:  #Well, yeah, I mean,# yeah, yeah, and, then, of course they call, you know,
before I got the answering machine, it was ridiculous --

A.87:  I know.

B.88:  -- you know, I said, this is absurd, I, you know, I, the minute I get home
the phone would be ringing.

A.89:  That's a, that's a good suggestion.  I might start using the answering
machine more, because --

B.90:  Oh, it's great, I mean.

A.91:  -- it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings.  

B.92:  Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard,
because I, I always have it on --

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  -- you know, and I'll get that, that message that says, uh, to, uh, um, you
know, uh, end this call, press three --

A.95:  Sure.

B.96:  -- [Laughter] and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard.

A.97:  [Laughter].

B.98:  You know [laughter].

A.99:  Yeah, you're probably right.

B.100:  Yeah it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was [laughter],

A.101:  [Laughter].

B.102:  you know, but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted, and then, you know,
people asking for, for money for everything, #you know, I mean.#

A.103:  #I understand.# I mean, I, it's hard to believe there's that many deputy
sheriffs associations and,

B.104:  Exactly, and, you know, the policeman's associations.

A.105:  I know, they call you one time to send three kids to the car-, --

B.106:  Oh, I used to do that.

A.107:  -- carnival or circus and,

B.108:  Yeah, I used to do that, I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something
[laughter].

A.109:  Right.  There's always a dif-, and I, my, my pat answer now is, well, you
just called me the other night,
