=========================================================================

A.1:  Okay, have you had to return anything lately that you've bought?

B.2:  Um, [lipsmack] no, not really I, uh, I may have had to have a, a few minor
repairs but I haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes
and things.

A.3:  Yeah.  

B.4:  And I will be in the very near future.  I'm going to be buying a big
computer and, um, [lipsmack] one of these eight millimeter camcorders.

A.5:  Oh, yeah, #that will be nice.# 

B.6:  #So I've been,# I've been studying these things.  But, uh, I haven't had to
return too many things I,

A.7:  I haven't either really.  

B.8:  I, I, I try to be very careful when I pick up something and, and look it
over to make sure that it looks like it's going to, [laughter] to work.

A.9:  Right.  Right.  

B.10:  And,

A.11:  Well I think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have
to return it.  Most, most places are willing to, you know, go with the
customer.

B.12:  I think it really turns down to picking who you want to buy from and I hate
to say it but the, the electronics devices that I buy the, the ones in Japan
--

A.13:  Uh-huh.  

B.14:  -- in generally, are much higher quality from #working.#

A.15:  #On,# yeah, I know.  #I know.#

B.16:  #I mean# I hate to admit it but it's true.  They, they have a higher
percentage of, uh, completely working models that get out to the public.

A.17:  That's true.  That's true.  I haven't had to return anything that I can
think of but, uh, you know, like radios and things, they've become so cheap
that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it
fixed.

B.18:  [Laughter]  That's right.  

A.19:  You know [laughter]. 

B.20:  You were speaking of that, about a week ago I bought myself a new digital
watch --

A.21:  Uh-huh.  

B.22:  -- that was made in China.  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  

B.24:  Works just fine and it cost me four dollars [laughter]. 

A.25:  Yeah.  Stuff like that, you know.

B.26:  Yes, it's amazing, isn't it?  

A.27:  Yeah, and, you know, like television and stereos and things.  They're a lot
cheaper if they are Japanese made.

B.28:  Yes.  

A.29:  You know, I, I've gotten to the point where I think so but, um, I've had to
return, um, I think a television one time and, uh, the color went out but and
it was like a month later.  And I didn't have,

B.30:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.31:  #any# problem whatsoever which I think is good but, you know, years ago you
didn't never have to return anything.  Everything worked for so long.

B.32:  That's right.  And, and that's been really, uh, the way it's been for me
for the last five or six years but I returned a T V set to be repaired but the
problem was that, uh, we had a, a lightning storm and --

A.33:  Oh, yeah.  

B.34:  -- the lightning flashed in through the power #and, uh,# 

A.35:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.36:  hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just, uh,
one of those circumstances.

A.37:  Well that's not bad at all.  

B.38:  No.  

A.39:  Well this is the first time I've ever gotten anybody outside of Texas
[laughter].

B.40:  Well, I tell you.  Most of my talks are in Texas.  That's true.  I, but
#I've been,#

A.41:  #Really?#  

B.42:  I've been, uh, talked into, uh, California twice in the last, uh, week or
two.

A.43:  Wow.  

B.44:  So it's, uh, [laughter] (( )).

A.45:  [Laughter]. 

B.46:  But, but I know how it is if you're going to take care of Texas you have to
live in Texas I suppose [laughter].

A.47:  [Laughter] Oh, my heavens.  But let's see, um, I can't think of any other
products I've taken back.  Um, clothes is about mainly what I've, you know,
gotten lately and,

B.48:  #Yeah.#

A.49:  #I# think they've gone downhill a-, as far as, unless you-, it's, you get
what you pay for.

B.50:  Well, we're being filled up with a lot of, of stores --

A.51:  Right.  

B.52:  -- that have huge qualities of, of, uh, clothes, 

A.53:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.54:  #and# articles and, you know, we've got Wal Marts and, 

A.55:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.56:  #((Gee Bees))# and a whole bunch of things and I don't know how we can
support all those things.

A.57:  #That's true.#  

B.58:  #And the,# and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products
so they can put them on the market cheaper for the public.

A.59:  Right.  

B.60:  And when that happens, more of those products are likely to have, uh,
inferior working ability and,

A.61:  #Yeah.# 

B.62:  #that's# when you have to start returning them.  

A.63:  Yeah, I agree with you.  

B.64:  So,  

A.65:  It's kind of hard for the small man.  

B.66:  Yeah.  

A.67:  So make it, you know, with the, the homemade things --

B.68:  That's right.  

A.69:  -- you know.  

B.70:  And I, I have a friend who does make, uh, beautiful furniture --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store. 

A.73:  Right.  

B.74:  It, it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it.

A.75:  Wow.  That's pretty interesting.  

B.76:  Yeah.  

A.77:  Huh.  Let me think of something else here [laughter]. 

B.78:  [Laughter]. 

A.79:  Um, I can't, that's the only thing I can think of is clothes, you know,
and, and they're going up so high if you want a well made, you know, piece of
clothing or i-, as a matter of fact furniture also, you know, you have to go,
you have to pay a lot more is the old adage you g-, get what you pay for.

B.80:  Yes.   

A.81:  But, um, you know, and you can get, oh, I know I bought a real cheap couch
one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long, you
know. I think the frame of it wasn't really good because it was probably mass
produced --

B.82:  Huh.  

A.83:  -- you know.  

B.84:  Actually I had some, uh, I bought a water softener for my home.

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  And I didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and I fin-, I
finally had to have the company come out and to check it out.

A.87:  Uh-huh.  

B.88:  So I did have that problem.  

A.89:  Huh.  

B.90:  And it was ((about)), I think it was more the installation was part of the
problem than the machine itself.

A.91:  Do you have a problem with your water heater?  Is i-,
