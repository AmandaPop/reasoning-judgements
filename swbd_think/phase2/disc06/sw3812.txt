A.1:  So, Cathy, what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work? 

@B.2:  Well, we have Bermuda grass here.  Do you have that there?  

A.3:  Uh, I don't know exactly what that is.  

B.4:  It's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time.  

A.5:  Uh, I don't,

B.6:  Do you live in an apartment or a house.  

A.7:  Yeah, I live in an apartment.  

B.8:  So you probably don't do any lawn care [laughter].  

A.9:  Yeah, that's, that's actually correct [laughter].  

B.10:  Oh, okay [laughter].  Well, we used to have a service come in and fertilize
and such, but we ran in some, into some money trouble, so, we do all of that
ourselves now.  Does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time?  Is
everything brown?

A.11:  Uh, it turns brown, yeah.  

B.12:  Yeah.  

A.13:  It freezes and everything, so.   

B.14:  Yeah, so right now we do nothing, because it's brown and it doesn't grow
until later on in the spring but,

A.15:  So does that mean you have to replant each year or,

B.16:  No, huh-uh, it just goes dormant and then it starts, it's, you know, it
rejuvenates itself in the springtime.  There are people that, uh, that reseed
in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like
that.  I can't remember exactly what it's called.  And so it's green in the
winter, but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's there and
it's kind of hard to grow.  It's kind of foolish [laughter] as far as I'm
concerned.

A.17:  I see.  

B.18:  So did you grow up in Iowa?  

A.19:  No, I'm actually from, uh, [lipsmack] uh, the Seattle area.  We lived
outside Mc-, outside of the c-, in the country and, uh, we have five acres of
land up against a hillside --

B.20:  Oh. 

A.21:  -- where I grew up and so we did have a garden, about a one, a half acre
garden.

B.22:  Yeah.  

A.23:  Big size and grew standard things like corn, beans and we had some trees,
apple trees, fruit trees, you know, and apple trees and,

B.24:  Did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff?  

A.25:  Oh, yeah.  

B.26:  Huh.  

A.27:  Lots of canning and we even made an annual trip out to eastern Washington,
Yakima area to get, uh, [lipsmack] peaches and things like that --

B.28:  Huh.  

A.29:  -- to can in addition to the, the fruit we got out of our own garden.

B.30:  Huh.  We have a garden here, but in Texas it's really hard to grow a garden
because it's so hot [laughter].

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  And the sun is so intense that, you know, the, the tomatoes come on and
they kind of fry right [laughter] on the plant so it's real hard.  And the b-,
you know, if that doesn't kill it, the bugs do, so I have tried k-, you know,
with just very little success to have a garden here.  Did you enjoy it?  Did
you like to do it when you were there?

A.33:  Oh, yeah, I enjoyed, uh, working in the garden.  Uh, my dad was a big, uh,
[breathing] fan of organic gardening.

B.34:  Huh.  

A.35:  And so when we, uh, did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana
peels and egg shells and --

B.36:  Yeah.  

A.37:  -- stuff that,

B.38:  You had a compost pile, huh?  

A.39:  Yeah, yeah and always picked a different place in the garden to dump it
out.  Had our own rototiller and rough, even though it was a large plot, we
used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was, it was quite a bit of
work for all of us, but we, #five kids and,#

B.40:  #How many,# how many were in your family?  

A.41:  Uh, [lipsmack] six kids altogether.  

B.42:  Was it something that the kids mostly took care of?  

A.43:  Actually, dad did more than his share.  

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  But, uh, we always had our, our assignments to help out.  

B.46:  Yeah.  

A.47:  So, and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the
canning and other things.

B.48:  Yeah.  

A.49:  [Breathing]. 

B.50:  What was your favorite thing -- 

A.51:  Uh,

B.52:  -- to eat?  

A.53:  Oh, to eat?  Oh, [breathing] uh, the, our big crops were, were green beans
and corn --

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  -- and I guess I liked the corn.  

B.56:  Yeah.  

A.57:  And so, [breathing] now that I'm in Iowa, I should be get, be able to get
lots of, uh --

B.58:  [Laughter] You'd think so.  

A.59:  -- corn on the cob, huh.  

B.60:  So, what took you to Iowa?  

A.61:  Uh, I just grad-, I, I'm working at the University of Iowa.  

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  Uh, on a post doctoral fellowship.  I just graduated [lipsmack] out west
with a P H D in physics.

B.64:  Where did you graduate?  

A.65:  Uh, Brigham Young University.  

B.66:  I knew it [laughter].  I'm a member, too, that's why I was [laughter], when
you were talking about your garden and everything and your --

A.67:  Oh. 

B.68:  -- mom canning, I thought, this guy's got to be [laughter], 

A.69:  [Laughter]. 

B.70:  got to have roots there somewhere.  

A.71:  Yes, and, uh, so, are you originally from Texas?  

B.72:  No, I grew up in California.  

A.73:  I see.  D-, did your family have a farm or were you more in the city?

B.74:  No, it was more in the city, but we did have a, uh, a little garden out in
the back --

A.75:  Uh-huh.  

B.76:  -- because anything grows there [laughter].  

A.77:  Oh, yeah.  

B.78:  You just stick it in the ground and it, it grows.  

A.79:  Yeah, my wife is from southern California.  Their family has a, an orange
tree and a lemon tree out back.

B.80:  Yeah.  

A.81:  And they grow a few things, they tr-, tomatoes and stuff, but, not, they
don't have very, you know, just a small backyard, so there's not too much else
they could do there.

B.82:  Yeah, do you have i-, in your apart-,
