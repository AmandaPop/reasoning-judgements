A.1:  Um, Tom what does camping mean to you?

@B.2:  Well, it usually just means sort of getting away from the normal, uh, time
spent with, uh, day to day job in the office and trying to enjoy the outdoors
for the most part.

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  Uh, I haven't done as much as I use to but I still like to go once and a
while and go camping.

A.5:  Uh-huh.  [inhaling] Well, when I think about camping, is uh, well back from
my boy scout days, uh, usually means hiking out in the mountains and, and, uh,
building your own camp fire, bringing your own food in a pack --

B.6:  Right.

A.7:  -- uh, and things like that.  Um, things that I associate with camping
usually [lipsmacking] the hikes and camping that we do, we go to a lake and
it might even involve some canoeing and, and, then we might, I remember
especially the fifty mile hikes.

B.8:  [Laughter]  The long ones.

A.9:  Where we would hike from lake to lake.  You know, one day --

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  -- we would be at one lake and hike to another lake.  They might be about
five or ten miles away.  The next day and things like that.

B.12:  My so-, my son has recently joined boy scouts and I, I've become fairly
active with them and, and, uh, he joined about four months ago and we have gone
on about three, uh, camp outs since then.  Uh, two of which involved, uh, back
packing and and hiking.  They are a pretty active troop and I have enjoyed it.
It has gotten me a chance to get back out and do a little bit more again.

A.13:  Uh-huh. [sniffing] Well, I haven't done [sniffing] much recently.  That is
just what comes to mind when I think of camping.  That is what I,

B.14:  [Throat_clearing].

A.15:  think of and was what I did when I was a boy scout.

B.16:  Yeah.

A.17:  Uh.

B.18:  We, uh, my family and I, we lived in Colorado up until about three years
ago for about fourteen years and, and of course, that was a great state for
camping.  Uh, to get up in the mountains and it was easy to go some place on a
weekend.  It's, it's a little more difficult for me now living in Texas, just
because there is so much private land in Texas and there is not too much in
the way of national forests and state lands that you can go hiking on here as
opposed to states in the west.  I don't know how the Iowa area is,

A.19:  [Sniffing].

B.20:  for, for that.

A.21:  Well, I just picture myself and I was going to say I really don't know
what's available here.  I know there is some lakes we could drive to, but I
don't know of any places where, you know, you can do hiking --

B.22:  You can, yeah, really get out and hike.

A.23:  -- and stuff like that.

B.24:  Uh-huh.

A.25:  I grew up in the Seattle area and the Cascade Mountains were just an hours
drive away and --

B.26:  Oh, yeah.

A.27:  -- but, that is where we did a lot of our hiking and camping, uh --

B.28:  Yeah.

A.29:  -- and then I lived while I was going to school at the University I was in
Utah and there is also you know, mountains there --

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  -- where you can do hiking, plenty of hiking and camping.

B.32:  Yeah.  Well camp, camping I guess, uh, different people look at it in
different ways and do different activities whether it is canoeing or, uh, back
packing or hiking.  Some people just like to go car camping and get away and
enjoy the part about building a camp fire and eating outside.  [laughter] And
doing that sort of thing even if it is not back packing.

A.33:  Yeah.

B.34:  Camping can still be enjoyable.  

A.35:  Yeah, I know.  For, from my mom, [lipsmacking] uh, camping is, uh,
definitely bringing the Coleman stove and,

B.36:  Yeah.  The two burner stove.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  Even if we do build a campfire along side, uh, the cooking is done
on the Coleman stove --

B.38:  Right.

A.39:  -- just cause it is more convenient.  Although, even when my family and I
went camping when we were growing up, uh, we, uh, went in the tents.  Always
you know.

B.40:  Yeah.  We. we've evolved to the stage of, uh, pop up tent camper camping
now that my, our kids have gotten a little bit, uh, uh, involved with camping
and my wife finally got tired of camping in tents and having to bail out the
water during rain storms and so forth.  So, she talked me into getting a pop
up camper, so our camping is sometimes a little more leisurely now than it use
to be, a little more.

A.41:  Oh, in the camper.  

B.42:  Yes, uh-huh.

A.43:  Oh, that would that is what makes it a little more luxurious.

B.44:  Yeah.  It is somewhere in between camping and going to, uh, a motel, I
guess [laughter].

A.45:  Well, I guess the main point is to get to, uh, enjoy the outdoors and you
know, especially if you go near a lake or mountains --

B.46:  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.47:  -- or you know, beautiful scenery.  You know.

B.48:  My son's boy scout troop does an annual one week float on the Buffalo River
in Arkansas and I, I am trying to make sure he gets his qualifications [noise]
in by next spring cause I would like to go on the trip with them cause they
camp out for seven or eight days while on the Buffalo River and their
floating, floating for that many days and I am looking forward.  That would be
uh, roughing it more than I have in a long time.
