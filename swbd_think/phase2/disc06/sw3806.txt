=============================================================================

A.1:  How many children do you have?  

B.2:  Uh, I have one child, a little girl who's eighteen, 

A.3:  [Clanking].

B.4:  months old.  

A.5:  Okay.  We've got one, he's, uh, thirteen weeks yesterday.  

B.6:  Oh, wow, congratulations.  

A.7:  Yeah.  

B.8:  Uh, actually, even though our daughter is a year and a half, we just got
her last July.  We adopted --

A.9:  Oh.

B.10:  -- a little girl -- 

A.11:  Okay.  

B.12:  -- from Beijing. 

A.13:  From Beijing? 

B.14:  Uh, yeah.

A.15:  Oh, okay.

B.16:  My wife is also Chinese.  

A.17:  Pardon?  

B.18:  My, my wife is Chinese.  

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  And so we, uh, traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so we're, she's
just at a playful age right now.

A.21:  Yeah.  

B.22:  We ((just)) do a lot of things, play with her and take her to a park.  Of
course, can-, right now it's too cold to go out too much here.  It's been
really cold.  But, uh, 

A.23:  It's not, not real toasty here either, but I imagine it's a good deal
colder in Iowa.

B.24:  Yeah, uh, although we were gone, 

A.25:  [Noise]. 

B.26:  for most of our Christmas and we, 

A.27:  [Squeak].

B.28:  had a nice time in, in California for our vacation visiting family.

A.29:  Yeah.  

B.30:  So, uh,

A.31:  Is that where you're from originally?  

B.32:  No, that's where my wife's from.  And we also visited Seattle, 

A.33:  [Noise].

B.34:  where I'm from.  

A.35:  Okay.  

B.36:  And so,  

A.37:  [Squeak]. 

B.38:  We just l-, 

A.39:  [Door]. 

B.40:  mainly, we, we, 

A.41:  [Hum]. 

B.42:  like to spend time playing games, 

A.43:  [/Hum].

B.44:  and, uh, just, she's sort of at a playful age, teaching her new words.

A.45:  Yeah.  

B.46:  Things like that. 

A.47:  Right now, uh, our son's just dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning
and crying and [laughter], 

B.48:  Yeah, so, yeah, your, your, 

A.49:  [Hum].

B.50:  activities probably consist of staying up at night.  

A.51:  [/Hum] [cough]. 

B.52:  Uh. 

A.53:  Actually, no, he sleeps real well at night.  

B.54:  Really?  

A.55:  Yeah.  

B.56:  That's good.  

A.57:  He'll, he, he generally sleeps through the night.  Uh, he'll go down about,
t-, well, he don't, doesn't go down till about ten, ten thirty which is a
little tough when you got a lot of studying to do, but, uh, he'll, uh, he
won't get up till like six o'clock, uh, somewhere between six and eight in the
morning.

B.58:  Oh, that's nice.  

A.59:  He'll be ravenously hungry by then, b-, [laughter],    

B.60:  Uh-huh.  

A.61:  But he's really a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night, too,
which is a real blessing.  It, it took about the first four weeks before he
started that, which I don't think it was quite coincidental, but he started
sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put
him in a crib in, in the next room.

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  Suddenly, he started sleeping through the night.  

B.64:  Well we -- 

A.65:  Almost consistently.  

B.66:  -- found that was important, too, for sleeping through the night.  Uh --

A.67:  Yeah.  

B.68:  -- having, uh, their, their own room [laughter].  

A.69:  Yeah.  

B.70:  In fact, it was almost trained  out of our daughter during  vacation where,
at our parents' house where it's just one, one room for all of us.

A.71:  Yeah.  

B.72:  Our daughter and us.  Uh, [lipsmack] the first few nights back, she was
terrified to be in the room by herself, but now she's --

A.73:  Yeah.  

B.74:  -- [Inhaling] sleeping through the night again so,   

A.75:   Yeah, that's good.  That's good.  

B.76:   Uh, we,

A.77:   Pardon?  

B.78:  My wife, uh, is, we als-, other things we're t-, trying to do, uh, uh, is
potty train our, our girl.  A year and a half, that's a little, some people
think that's a little bit early, but, uh, she was, the foster parents, our
friends in China, 

A.79:  [Squeak] [door].

B.80:  who had taken care of her before we could get her, uh -- 

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  -- [Lipsmack] have a, Chinese generally potty train their children a little
bit earlier, earlier, and, uh --

A.83:  Yeah.  

B.84:  -- so, uh, we're having, spend some time with that also.  

A.85:  Yeah.  

B.86:  But and, 

A.87:  That's got to be a, a lot of fun [laughter].  

B.88:  Yeah, well, I'd, she doesn't enjoy it that much, but, uh -- 

A.89:  Yeah.  

B.90:  -- she's learning slowly but surely.  

A.91:  Yeah, uh, uh, it's, you know,   

B.92:  We have a little book, it talks about giving rewards and so it's a pleasant
experience and things like that.

A.93:  Yeah, yeah, well, they, they, the children are going to eventually t-, wind
up training themselves, but, uh, they can be trained into it pretty early,
too.  So, [laughter] I remember some of the strange potty training experiences
when I, we were growing up amongst the brothers and sisters.  So, 

B.94:  Uh-huh.  

A.95:  And we're almost kind of not looking forward to that [laughter].

B.96:  Yeah.  

A.97:  Anyway,   

B.98:  But there's a lot of, we, we're just having lots of fun with, with our
little girl right now.  Uh.

A.99:  Yeah.  

B.100:  [Lipsmack] She has lots of toys.  Got little, she especially likes the
little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has.

A.101:  Yeah.  

B.102:  Uh, and then reading, she likes us to, to go through the books, you know,
and she could say a few word, you know, she could, learning to say the names
of, you know, a lot of simple animals and, uh, [lipsmack] [inhaling] and, you
know, the sounds that they make.

A.103:  Uh-huh.  

B.104:  [Lipsmack] Like duck says quack and -- 

A.105:  Yeah.  

B.106:  -- doggy says ruff, things like that, so that's about her, her stage right
now and --

A.107:  Oh, that's good.

B.108:  -- she's running around.  She, she started, when we first adopted her we,
she, she wasn't walking yet, but she was soon walking within a couple weeks
after that.

A.109:  Yeah.  

B.110:  And, now she's running all,
