=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay, Lee.  Tell me about your ideas on this, uh, the U S government
supporting health insurance and so forth.

@B.2:  Well, I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health
care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed
adequately, uh, the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has, uh,
provided some very good health care and, uh, much, I think inadequate health
care.  Uh, and in some cases, the absence of health care has resulted from
market place forces and I think, uh, it's inevitable.  It is just a matter of,
uh, time and mistakes [children] and they're both inevitable.

A.3:  Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting
this work now and hopefully are doing, uh, a good job?

B.4:  Well, it's going to make it tough for them and it's going to be a difficult
transition.  I don't know, uh, how it's going to, uh, play out in terms of the
particulars, but I don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the
current health care crisis for too long.  Our, uh, physical and mental and
spiritual health, uh, it's really, uh, very costly.

A.5:  Yes.

B.6:  And, uh, as a society [laughter] we are paying a staggering price for this.

A.7:  #Well# --

B.8:  #My,#

A.9:  -- this is what's bothering me, Lee, another question, do you think that
there should be some control, uh, innovated such that the doctors are not
allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things.  We realize that for the
individual person, some things are very important.  Uh, matter of fact, in
some respects their life might depend on it.

B.10:  Right.

A.11:  But, by the same token some of these charges they make for well, minor
endeavors, shall we say --

B.12:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

A.13:  -- on the parts the doctors are really out of line.

B.14:  Yeah, #there are abus-,#  --

A.15:  #There should be some control of that.#

B.16:  -- they're abusive of privileges [children].

A.17:  Yes and that is what is giving the local, uh, insurance companies hard
times.  That is the one thing we have no control over are these charges that
happen when you go to hospitals and you get something done and they want to
charge twenty thousand dollars for it.

B.18:  Right.  Well, this I think is one of the things that national health care
of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten, or twenty or thirty
years will address.  Because I know this is, addressed by, uh, in Canada.  I,
I have a good friend who is, uh, a physician practicing in Canada.  And they
made the transition, uh, and I think that the, uh, for example the duplication
of magnetic resonance imageries --

A.19:  Yes.

B.20:  -- uh,

A.21:  We have had several of them.  My wife and I both have had that recently.

B.22:  I've, I've had one myself and, uh, they're wonderful technology, but cities
have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they
need.  So, I think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way
the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because there
is a tendency, uh, at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of
medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the
bills, but it's begun to change all of that.  The people paying the bills, uh,
employers ultimately, have begun to squawk because they have seen their health
care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years.

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  So, I think the evolution will be interesting.  Uh, Hawaii has a system
that is apparently working and, uh, it will be interesting to see how, how,
uh, much more attention we pay to that.  [child] I do think though that it is
inevitable primarily because of the pain, uh, that people are feeling, uh,
under the circumstances.  Uh, I believe that it will contribute to something
that we would at this point call national health care, whether it's subsidized
by the government and and operated by private insurers, uh, I don't know.  I
like that idea.  I tend to be one of those people who believes the market
place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very
well.  Uh, I, we would be a lot better off if we, if we, contracted our
national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity
because we would probably have much less waste.

A.25:  See, that, that bothers me about the government see, #uh, my,#

B.26:  #Well that's,# that's the problem with government, uh, administration of
these programs [child] and that is one of the things that we as society are
going to have to deal with.  Government is going to have to change in this
regard.

A.27:  Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State
basis or U S government basis?

B.28:  You know, that is really a tough one for me to answer.  I don't, uh, I
would like to see the greatest improvement in management.  My, my, my field is
the cognitive sciences and I recognize that a lot of these things that are
done, [child_whining] are done, uh, as a function of the operating systems in
place.  And those operating systems have to change and and as we become more
efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more
efficient human operating systems and so a State or federal application, uh,
could work.  Uh, it all depends upon the way you structure the environment.
We may have to deal with,
