======================================================================

B.1:  Uh, how's the crime rate up there?  

@A.2:  Uh, well we're right between, uh, Milwaukee and Chicago.  

B.3:  Okay.  

A.4:  So there's, there's just been a big coke bust, uh, [laughter] here, because
I think people pass through --

B.5:  Uh-huh.  

A.6:  -- you know, on their way back and forth through the bigger cities.

B.7:  Yeah.  

A.8:  Uh, it's, it's okay, I mean, there's crime everywhere.  It, it's probably
not, it's not, you know, the --

B.9:  Right.  

A.10:  -- best place --  

B.11:  #Is that# --

A.12:  -- #to be but,#

B.13:  -- anywhere near Racine?  

A.14:  Yeah, it's right next to Racine.  

B.15:  Really?  My, uh, old, old girlfriend, uh, was from there.  

A.16:  Oh, really?  

B.17:  Yeah.  

A.18:  [Laughter]. 

B.19:  Uh, actually I w-, I went and saw her about four years ago.  Her parents
had moved to Chicago and, uh, at this point they had moved out of Dallas and
everything, then they had moved back and she was,

A.20:  [Laughter]. 

B.21:  going to school down here, and I went and saw her one summer and, uh, we
went up there.  I never been up there, I just remember s-, --

A.22:  Yeah. 

B.23:  -- ((it's)) a different area from down here, obviously but, uh, 

A.24:  Oh, yeah, it's like ten minutes away from me.  

B.25:  Yeah, so you're a cheese head, huh?  

A.26:  [Laughter]. 

B.27:  [Laughter]. 

A.28:  No.

B.29:  Yeah, well, we're, I mean, down here, I mean, Dallas, I mean, this crime
rate's ridiculous.  I mean, it's just, I'm getting ready to move actually in
the, probably the next year or so.  So, I mean but,

A.30:  Really, that bad?  The cr-, because of the crime?  

B.31:  It's, it, yeah, I mean, it isn't Washington, D C, but it's, there's,

A.32:  [Laughter]. 

B.33:  just so many, uh, I mean we've had like four or five, uh, since school
started, like, uh, in high school people, uh, incidents where kids shooting,
you know, a teacher or, you know, since, you know, the school year and
everything, like New Year's Eve there were three people shot right away.  I
mean --

A.34:  Wow.  

B.35:  -- like in the first ten minutes of the new year, you know, so, it's just
been, it's ridiculous.  There's a lot of problems right now, I mean, the, 
uh --

A.36:  With the,  

B.37:  -- the police chief out here is the former assistant police chief, uh,
Darryl Gates in L A so, I mean, he's not, like, you know, beating up
anybody, but there's just, it's a big city and it's what, you know, you get
and there's, there's just getting a lot, it's getting overcrowded and there's
a lot of, uh, immigrants from, uh, Mexico and stuff so --

A.38:  Oh, yeah.  

B.39:  -- it's, it's, it's getting pretty ridiculous.  

A.40:  Um.

B.41:  But, uh, I'm sure, you know, since you're near Chicago, I'm sure you could
s-, [laughter],

A.42:  [Laughter]. 

B.43:  it's not exactly a peaceful city, either, you know.  

A.44:  No, it's not [laughter].  

B.45:  Yeah, it's the same situation, really.  

A.46:  It,

B.47:  So I'm actually in Richardson which is just north of Dallas.  It's a little
suburb, but, yeah, I mean,

A.48:  It, yeah, it's gotten worse, too.  Nothing's getting better. 

B.49:  #Yeah, I don't see how it can# --

A.50:  #Seems like it's getting,# 

B.51:  -- get better, I mean, it's got to totally,

A.52:  I think it has to get worse first, before it can get better. 

B.53:  Yeah, stricter laws or something that,

A.54:  Yeah.  

B.55:  Uh,

A.56:  They need something.  And it,

B.57:  If I could solve problems, I'd be a rich person, but, guess I can't.  I'm
just, it's one of those deals where, I mean, you know, try to look at, you
know, look at, at other countries, what they do, but, I mean, we're not like
barbarics, uh, uh, you know, it's just too many problems with, uh, people
getting paroled bef-, uh, you know, early and coming out, committing another
crime while they're still on probation.  We've had a lot of problems out here
with that, course [inhaling],

A.58:  Yeah.

B.59:  I,

A.60:  I heard, uh, Dallas cops are really strict like,

B.61:  Well, it's, it's kind of, yeah, they shoot first, then ask questions later.

A.62:  Oh, yeah [laughter].  

B.63:  You know, that's, that's their motto.  

A.64:  Whoa [laughter].  

B.65:  They're, they're not, uh, you got to be careful if, I mean, I never had a
problem, I mean, I'm not like, [laughter] just, you just don't hang out in
Dallas, or you got to ((be)), you know, where not to be at night and the, you
know, just are certain places you don't even, certain parts of town you just
stay away from, you know.

A.66:  Yeah, same here certain parts of our city, uh, you just don't go --

B.67:  Right.  

A.68:  -- by, you just don't [laughter],

B.69:  Yeah, you just leave it alone, I mean,

A.70:  Because then you're asking for trouble.  

B.71:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old are you?  

A.72:  Twenty-one.  

B.73:  Twenty-one?  

A.74:  Yep.  

B.75:  Yeah, oh, twenty-three.  

A.76:  Twenty-three.  

B.77:  Yeah, uh, that's pretty wild.  Right next to Racine, huh?  

A.78:  Yeah, uh, actually, uh, my sister lives in Racine.  

B.79:  Really?  

A.80:  Yeah.  

B.81:  God, I never thought I would ever run into somebody, like I'll read the
paper every now and then and something, Racine, Wisconsin will pop out, you
know, but, yeah, it's just kind of a little town, uh, ha-,

A.82:  It's bigger than Kenosha by a little bit, and their crime rate's, crime
rate's a lot worse than ours.

B.83:  Really?  

A.84:  Yeah, they, just some guy, uh, couple months ago, got out a machete, did
you read about that, and started just hacking people in the street with it.

B.85:  With the machete?  

A.86:  Yeah.  

B.87:  No, I didn't hear about that.  

A.88:  Oh, that was in Racine [laughter].  

B.89:  God.  

A.90:  It's sad.  I mean, you can't even drive or walk down the street at night or
anything.

B.91:  Well, uh, in Wheaton, Illinois where her parents live and that's where
that, uh,

A.92:  I've heard of that.  

B.93:  Yeah, it's just like forty-five miles outside of Chicago -- 

A.94:  Uh-huh.  

B.95:  -- and few years ago I guess there was some, uh, think it was some, some
lady was like sh-, uh, k-, attacked some school child-,
