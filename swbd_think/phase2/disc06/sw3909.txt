============================================================================

A.1:  Hi.  Th-, my name is Brigette.

B.2:  Brigette, this is Maureen.

A.3:  Hi.  Nice to meet you.  Uh, do you know what we are supposed to talk about?

B.4:  Yeah.  If there is something wrong with the school system.

A.5:  Yeah.  So are you ready then?

B.6:  Sure.

A.7:  Okay. I press one don't I?  

B.8:  Right.  Oh. 

A.9:  Okay, I have never done this before so [laughter].

B.10:  [Laughter] [beep] Are you there?

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  Okay.

A.13:  Okay.  So what do you think is wrong with the school system?

@B.14:  Well, you know I was listening [barking] to uh, SIXTY MINUTES, I think the
other night they had Andy Rooney on there --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- and one of the comments he was making is that, uh, you know part of the
problem is, uh, parents and, uh, their lack I guess of, uh, interest in the
kids in school and stuff.  Basically, until we change that, uh, we are not
going to have the kids, uh, get any smarter because, uh, you know, they're not
[noise] encouraging their kids to do well in school so --

A.17:  Uh-huh.

B.18:  -- otherwise, we are not going to ever achieve a good education system
unless we really get the parents involved.

A.19:  Yeah, I agree with that, but coming from, cause I am in college right now
--

B.20:  Uh-huh.

A.21:  -- and seeing how the school systems are.  My mom is a teacher, that's very
hard to do in some areas, you know.

B.22:  Yeah.

A.23:  It's like they sent and I know where my mom teaches, you know, and she
teaches in like a lower class, part of Plano.  Where is they just send their
kids to school and you know.  They don't care if they do their homework, if
they don't do their homework, whatever.

B.24:  Right.  

A.25:  So she says it's very hard from that aspect.  I mean she will call the
parents and they, you know, they are like, you know, that's not my
responsibility.  It's yours.

B.26:  Um.

A.27:  And I know she gets real frustrated being a teacher, but she feels like,
you know, that the parents aren't willing to do that which is very scary, I
think.

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Another thing I think, I know now because I am getting ready to graduate
and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are, uh, people that
aren't getting a master's are having an easier time getting a job cause they
can get paid less.

B.30:  Oh, yeah.

A.31:  It seems like they are just compromising good qualified, educated teachers
just for someone they can pay less and they get, they don't get paid much now
and I think that's really bad.

B.32:  Yeah, that's kind of a shame that, uh, we don't put emphasis and money
where we really should and we have never really paid teachers real well --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- we have never paid, uh, other public servants like the police and such
very well --

A.35:  Yeah.

B.36:  -- it is kind of a shame.  Uh, there are some times that I think that, uh,
you know, the quality of teachers may be improved upon.  I think what they did
a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all.

A.37:  Yeah.  #Uh-huh.#

B.38:  #Uh, I think# --

A.39:  I think it was.

B.40:  -- I think that there they made some changes, you know, into, uh, the kind
of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and, uh, trying to
improve upon them, uh, somewhat, but uh, they've never really paid, you know,
real well and, and you know, people have to pick an occupation that's going to
support themselves.  It can't be all sacrifices and no --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- you know salary [laughter].

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  You have got to live on something.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  [Throat_clearing]  But,

A.47:  I think it's hard though cause even like the, like in high school and
stuff, you take the standardized tests and stuff --

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  -- and I know people that, you know, are like dys-.  I mean I know people
in college that are like dyslexic.

B.50:  Um.

A.51:  But, I wonder how they pass all their school, you know.  All their years of
school.

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  And pass the, all the tests that they had to pass there and so forth to get
to college because they have the hardest time --

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  -- you know.  Things like that always make me wonder too.  I mean they make
all these tests, but are they really proving anything.

B.56:  Yeah, that's true.  And you know some people are much better test takers
than others --

A.57:  Yeah.  That's definitely, true.

B.58:  -- uh, some people you know, uh, just really clam up when it comes to a
test and they are so nervous about well is there, is this a trick question --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it,
they, uh, [laughter] get themselves, you know, worse grades because they were
so anxious about it.

A.61:  See, yeah.

B.62:  And then other people, you know, aren't that upset about it and they test
very well.  So there has to be different ways of, of testing sometimes you
know --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- because uh, that isn't always a real good reflection of if the persons
learned it or not.

A.65:  Yeah, I agree.  I think there's just so many problems now with just kids,
you know, younger these days and all the problems they have and all the
problems like in general in the world, like with gangs or such just being
brought into the school and making it worse.  I think that's not even helping
at all.

B.66:  Yeah, you know, uh, [laughter] I, I wouldn't want to be back in school now.
I think it, uh, it's a real challenge and you know, uh, I think maybe the kids
need more, uh, I don't know, counseling or --

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  -- or you know, psychologist or just talking about how to get along in
life but they're not getting that so much from home,
