B.1:  Hey, Larry.

A.2:  Yes, sir.

B.3:  What was the last home repair job you did?

A.4:  Well, uh, you mean that I did, or had done?

B.5:  Had, either one.

@A.6:  Either one [throat_clearing].  Well, actually, um, this whole past summer
I've had my whole outside of my house repainted, and a lot of the little minor
wood things corrected --

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  -- and just prior to that I had a, a bathroom totally remodeled and
rebuilt, and, uh, so I've, I'm bringing my house up to date, really.

B.9:  How old is your house?

A.10:  We built the house in nineteen sixty.

B.11:  Well, that's not that old of a house, but --

A.12:  No.

B.13:  -- things do change from time to time, don't they.

A.14:  That's right, they, they do change, and, and the bathrooms, you know, if
you have any water leakage anywhere, can, uh, slowly deteriorate things and so
you got to plug those leaks up.

B.15:  You all have basements, 

A.16:  [Throat_clearing]. 

B.17:  in Pennsylvania, don't you?

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  We don't have basements in Texas, unless it's a, a very unusual situation.

A.20:  Is that right?  Is the water level high there?

B.21:  Uh, no, we build them on pier and beams, as they, up for few years back,
and then what's popular now is just called a slab.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  And we don't have snow to speak of. 

A.24:  Oh, well, we just got about a, an inch, inch and a half last night.

B.25:  If it snows in Dallas we, we wo-, we don't go to work, 

A.26:  [Laughter].

B.27:  and wait for it to melt, and at lunch we have the day off, you know.

A.28:  I see.

B.29:  I'm serious.  We just, we don't have any snow plows.

A.30:  [Laughter] I declare.

B.31:  Uh, last home project I guess, well, a year and a half ago we bought a
house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been, well, sad
situation, estate thing --

A.32:  Uh-huh.

B.33:  -- and we've kind of put the whole thing back together.  Uh, the biggest
thing I did was, uh, re-fence and re-decked in the back.

A.34:  Oh, I see.  Are you doing this yourself?

B.35:  Are you kidding?

A.36:  [Throat_clearing] [laughter].

B.37:  I'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a,

A.38:  [Laughter].  

B.39:  hammer and a nail.  It wouldn't be straight anyway.

A.40:  I declare.  #Oh, well.#

B.41:  #Uh.# 

A.42:  [Laughter].

B.43:  Let's see, and we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their
so-called spare time, they moonlight --

A.44:  Uh-huh.

B.45:  -- and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow
page advertised --

A.46:  That's true.  These --

B.47:  -- personnel.

A.48:  -- lot of fellows are, are really want to work pretty hard, so they're
willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices, I'm sure of that.  I
just had some guttering also replaced on my home --

B.49:  Uh-huh.

A.50:  -- uh, I actually replaced all the other guttering last year and the piece
that I did this year seemed all right at the time, so I left it alone.

B.51:  Have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now?

A.52:  That's what I put up this last time.

B.53:  No kidding.

A.54:  It's one solid piece about thirty feet long.

B.55:  Were you, were you hap-, did they make it right there on your property?

A.56:  [Throat_clearing]  No, it was, uh, brought out on a truck.

B.57:  Oh, okay.

A.58:  So they, I, it was, I have seen these things done.  They, uh, they come on
great big large wheels, I think, of material and they roll it off.

B.59:  I haven't seen it done.  When we moved into the, the house, we, we got
guttering bids, we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a
hundred bucks.  Those guys were going to sell me a three thousand [clicking]
(( )), 

A.60:  [Throat_clearing].

B.61:  go ahead, and, uh, they talked about bringing a machine out and just making
it right there in the front yard and --

A.62:  Yeah.

B.63:  -- putting it up as they make it, so I've never seen one.

A.64:  Well, as, I say, this was already, uh, [clicking] they had come out and
measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they
had to do was mount them and then, uh, seal one joint, where the two ends came
together.

B.65:  I just thought of a project I did.  My wife wanted an island in the
kitchen.

A.66:  Uh-huh.

B.67:  Well, we, the house isn't that new.  So I built a, uh, [clicking] a, uh, a
table --

A.68:  Uh-huh.

B.69:  -- from the local hardware store, we got an outfit called Home Depot, which
is probably local down here, but --

A.70:  Uh-huh.

B.71:  -- I ordered a formica top with rounded corners --

A.72:  Uh-huh.

B.73:  -- and then they have premade and bevelled, uh, legs and braces, and so I
simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces, and, and, uh, put it
together, and, uh --

A.74:  Worked all right, huh.
	
B.75:  -- and it worked just fine.  It was pre-, the legs were premeasured
exactly the same length, so it's level.  Hold it, I have to put two business
cards underneath it [laughter].

A.76:  [Laughter].

B.77:  That's pretty damn close for an amateur.

A.78:  That's very, very close, I, as they say down south, you done good.

B.79:  Yeah [laughter].

A.80:  [Laughter].

B.81:  Had somebody come through and he said, my gosh, if you'd bought that at a
store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars, and I got out --

A.82:  Yeah.

B.83:  -- for about a hundred and forty-five, I think.

A.84:  Well, that sounds great.

B.85:  So, I's happy.

A.86:  Yeah.  Well, I've got this, as we were talking earlier about my house, I've
got one more bathroom --

B.87:  Uh-huh.

A.88:  -- to rebuild, and, uh, we also had a, a, a porch that extends out from our
master bedroom --

B.89:  How nice.

A.90:  -- that we want to rebuild.  It's, uh, taken a beating over the years, and
um, now we're afraid to walk out on it, because some of the wood is
deteriorating.

B.91:  Are you all in the mountains?

A.92:  Uh, we're in between the mountains, we're, we're in, uh, what we're called
Nitny Valley at Penn State, I,
