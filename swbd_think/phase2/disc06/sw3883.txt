=============================================================================

A.1:  Okay.  So how do you just figure (( )),

B.2:  Well, you know, it depends upon our weather here.  You know, today was a
beautiful day it was like, uh, uh, summer day.  It was seventy degrees so --

A.3:  Wow.  

B.4:  -- so I dressed in, uh, uh, a light weight skirt, it's a, uh, ultra suede
skirt and a blouse with a sweater, cardigan --

A.5:  Uh-huh.  

B.6:  -- over it.  Because I had some appointments at the office today, some
interviews and so I had to dress up anyway and then I wore heels, you know.

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  But when it rains a lot, which is has been doing here a lot lately, uh,
very often, you know, wear, uh, pants and boots --

A.9:  Oh.  
 
B.10:  -- you know.  So how do you dress?  

A.11:  Well, um, [lipsmack] I'm going to talk about when I was working as a
teacher and when I #was [laughter] ((working)) at now.#

B.12:  #Okay.# 

A.13:  Um, when I was a teacher, um, in Utah, I would generally wear, um, dresses
and heels and things like that,

B.14:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.15:  #and# even when it, um, rained and snowed I just braved it and I wore heels
anyway [laughter].

B.16:  Yeah.  

A.17:  #And,# 

B.18:  #I,# I can see, I, I've been a teacher so has my daughter and I know that
we very often wore heels despite the fact that,

A.19:  #I know,#

B.20:  #it was tiring.#  

A.21:  it might kill you to go up and [laughter], 

B.22:  #That's right.#  

A.23:  #walk up to# the door but you're going to look nice for the kids
[laughter].

B.24:  That's right and it always makes you feel like you're a bigger person than
the kids, right?

A.25:  Oh, oh, yeah.  Well, I need all the height I can get [laughter].

B.26:  Yeah, I do too.  [laughter] So to be taller than some of the boys in the
bigger grades,

A.27:  #Oh, yeah.#

B.28:  #uh, older grades, I had# to wear heels.  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, we too.  Um, [lipsmack] if it was real-, it looked really
dangerous then I would wear boots but then I would change, um, into heels,

B.30:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.31:  #as soon as I got# to my desk.  So, um,

B.32:  Of course, we wear, uh, an unlined boots, you know, it has a heel on it.
They're the kind of boots that I wear to work and we wear them, you know,
they're a leather boot that you wear and as I said they have a regular heel on
them, high heel.

A.33:  Oh.  

B.34:  And they wear them, we wear them a lot with shirts and things.  Uh, it's
kind of a, [laughter] I can't say constant down here in Texas that you wear
these boots.  They're not a cowboy boot, but they're just a real pretty boot,
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain.

A.35:  Oh.  

B.36:  As I have a private high school that I run here and so when I'm
interviewing a parent, of course I feel like I need to wear heels --

A.37:  [Laughter]  Sure.  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  -- you know, and look like I'm a business [laughter] person. 

A.39:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.

B.40:  You know, because the children will tease about where's your motorcycle,

A.41:  [Laughter] .

B.42:  if you wear boots too often, you know. 

A.43:  Huh.  Well, um,

B.44:  Of course, you probably wear coats a lot.  

A.45:  Yeah, um, [lipsmack] the first two years I was in a room where they didn't
heat it [laughter]. #So I did,# 

B.46:  #Oh, my goodness# so then you had to.  

A.47:  Yeah, and then the third year we, um, got heating so it was nice
[laughter].

B.48:  Yes.  Then things improved, right?  

A.49:  Right, uh-huh.  

B.50:  But of course, here we wear a light weight jacket a lot #you know, you
know,#

A.51:  #Oh, that's# nice.  

B.52:  and, uh, that's very seldom we, it depends upon our winter.  We have a few
days you might wear a coat, winter coat, you know, but most of the time you
can wear a sweater and we just don't wear coats much.  We often laugh about
even when it turns chilly.  We're wearing something lightweight or no jacket
because we're so used to running around like that.

A.53:  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Nice.  Well [laughter],

B.54:  It's really different.  [laughter] Let's put it that way.  Are you not
teaching anymore?

A.55:  Uh, no, we, we moved to Iowa and, um, I'm working at a day care right now.

B.56:  I see.  

A.57:  And so the way I dress is really different because I'm working in the
nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months.

B.58:  Oh, so you don't wear heels anymore I'll bet.  

A.59:  Yeah, I wear, uh, tennis shoes, 

B.60:  #Yeah, uh-huh.# 

A.61:  #and# jeans and things that, you know, are sort of, um,

B.62:  #More practical.# 

A.63:  #not,# yes, it doesn't matter if I have to wash it a hundred times or
something.

B.64:  When you were teaching, did you ever have, uh, uh, a blue jean day or
anything like that?

A.65:  Yeah, but I never wore jeans because, um, I thought that was too casual
[laughter].

B.66:  Yeah, well, 

A.67:  #For,# 

B.68:  #I know that# some of the schools they have, uh, country western day or
something like that one, you know, or tacky day, and I always thought it was
kind of out of, got out of hand when the teachers looked real [laughter] tacky
too.

A.69:  Yeah, really.  

B.70:  It's all right for the students, they look tacky a lot but I didn't think
teachers should, you know.

A.71:  [Laughter]  Yeah, that's how I feel too.  

@@B.72:  Yeah.  Do you like, uh, uh, Iowa?  

A.73:  Um, [lipsmack] oh, it, there's some good things about it but I've seen.  A
lot of things I'm not used to yet, um,

B.74:   Where did you live before?  

A.75:   Um, we lived in Utah before and, and I grew up in California. 

B.76:   Oh, well, that's quite a change from California to Utah,
