===========================================================================

A.1:  How do you get most of your news?

@B.2:  Well, I say, uh, a good question.  Uh, I read the newspaper obviously and,
and watch, watch T V and, uh,

A.3:  What are your favorites on T V for, uh, news programs?

B.4:  Uh, we have one here at at six o'clock in the evening to seven where we
have local news [throat_clearing] followed by I, I can't name the, C B S, I
guess it is.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  Who is the gentleman that M C -s, that program?

A.7:  Uh, uh, that's terrible.  I know I should know these, but.  Uh, is Dan
Rather, C B S?

B.8:  Yeah.  I think, I think it's Dan Rather, yeah.  I, I've just retired
recently, so I have had very little time really to watch T V --

A.9:  Uh-huh.

B.10:  -- and, uh, to get the news.  So all of my time that was available wasn't
until about six and seven.  Uh, obviously, I scanned the newspaper --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and, uh, I think, 

A.13:  Are you one of those people that tends to like, uh, go through the
newspaper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something --

B.14:  No,

A.15:  -- or do you like to read at the end of the day.

B.16:  I get mine at the end of the day.

A.17:  Yes, that's the way I am.

B.18:  [Throat_clearing] At least I use to and now I am beginning to read it about
noon [laughter].

A.19:  Oh, that's nice.

B.20:  Since I have just retired, I retired from Penn State and I just, uh, now I
have some morning time available and it use to be that we got our newspapers
in the evening --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- which I liked because that's when I could read it --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- and I felt like it was fresh and for the last two or three years our
newspapers have been coming early morning and it has been six or seven o'clock
at night before I got to read it --

A.25:  Yeah.

B.26:  -- and I had already heard all kinds of conflicting things #during the day#
--

A.27:  #Oh, really [laughter].#

B.28:  -- before I read a newspaper [laughter].

A.29:  Uh-huh.  [laughter] Sometimes it feels as though what I am reading in the
newspaper is the old news.  It's as if I heard it just the day before on the
television [noise].

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And I wonder where they get a lot of their stories, but I think that the
one that I feel like I get the most information from is, is, uh, MCNEIL LEHRER.
And sometimes, it is on in the afternoon --

B.32:  Uh.

A.33:  -- if I am home, but I work most of the time so, uh --

B.34:  Uh-huh.

A.35:  -- the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal
because,

B.36:  Well, that's like normal time, six to seven.

A.37:  Yeah, you are preparing dinner, but you still have an opportunity to look
out of the kitchen.  We have a little two year old so --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- there is not a lot of time to, uh, for me I feel to spend as much time
with the up dates as I would like to.  I think I probably get more of it from
Lee because he works out of our home and, uh, can give me information
[laughter] about what might have happened that day if he watched the afternoon
MCNEIL LEHRER.

B.40:  How do you feel about the authenticity of these various, uh, methods of,
uh, presenting the news?

A.41:  It seems to be that MCNEIL LEHRER spends more time with each issue
therefore I can count on it being more accurate, uh, because they really spent
more development of the story as well as the research and I get a better
picture of what it is I am hearing about.  I, I wonder about the authenticity
of the others.  Uh, I have a feeling that they get a lot from U P I and E P
and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and, uh, just --

B.42:  Yes.

A.43:  -- give little spots to it and,

B.44:  I always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information.  That's
what bothers me.

A.45:  Uh-huh.

B.46:  Particularly, you know, when we had this business of the of the war over
there in Europe.

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  I mean I always wondered about, uh, did they base what they said on whoever
told them.  Well, whoever told them might not necessarily have the accurate
news.  And know, know the ov-, the overall --

A.49:  Right.

B.50:  -- uh, story.

A.51:  Certainly and in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press
from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall
out I think [laughter].

B.52:  Yeah.

A.53:  But there was probably some repetition of of stories that didn't have
complete uh, confirmation.  I wonder that about the whole Clinton thing
recently.  Uh, you now, something coming out of the tabloids and being picked
up by a major media.  Uh, one of the accusations --

B.54:  Uh.

A.55:  -- obviously that they didn't go down there and research it and get enough
information.  I don't have a preference or opinion really on that story one
way or the other --

B.56:  Uh-huh.

A.57:  -- but, it's uh, clear that there is a lot of controversy about it
[laughter].

B.58:  Well, there, the only thing that you can be sure of that has gotten it
straight from the horse so to speak, is uh, did you hear President Bush's
speech the other night?

A.59:  Yes.

B.60:  Well,

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  at least we know what he said.

A.63:  This is true [laughter].

B.64:  And we we don't have to uh, read in the newspaper what they think he said
--

A.65:  Uh-huh.

B.66:  -- or what the Democrats think he said.  We know, uh, what we heard him
say.

A.67:  Uh-huh.  But, it is always interesting to hear the follow ups.  You know on
any kind of major #presentation# --

B.68:  #Yes.#

A.69:  -- you always get the analysis.

B.70:  That's when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background
--

A.71:  Uh-huh.

B.72:  -- that know one else knows about.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  That's the problem when you are in, uh, politics.  There's always somebody
working behind your back who just doesn't want you to get your way simply just
because you are on the other team.  Well, that's ridiculous really.

A.75:  Well, they all have their perceptions too, #you know.#

B.76:  #Yeah.#

A.77:  They may have heard the exact same thing and that is just their,
