=========================================================================

A.1:  Um, have you lived in Garland long?

B.2:  Um, yeah, we're goin-, about six years, yeah.

A.3:  About si-, tell me your name again.  I'm sorry.

B.4:  Carol.

A.5:  Carol.

B.6:  #Uh-huh.#

A.7:  #Okay.#  Uh, are you in a new area or old?

B.8:  Um, well it's about six years old.  We've lived here as long as the house
has been built.  So I guess it is new in some ways.

A.9:  Yeah, yeah.

B.10:  [Laughter] Although we're learning it's falling apart [laughter].

A.11:  Oh, really?

B.12:  No, that's exaggeration.  But we had some problems yesterday so,

A.13:  Oh, no.

B.14:  [Laughter].

A.15:  Leakage or,

B.16:  Um, some plumbing problems.

A.17:  [Lipsmack]  Oh. 

B.18:  So it damaged the carpet and we're going to have to do something, we're not
sure.  Call insurance or something so,

A.19:  I'm not sure what to do.

B.20:  [Laughter].

A.21:  Well, our house is about, um, twelve years old.

B.22:  #Uh-huh.#

A.23:  #I guess,# we've been in it for about two years.  And [breathing] I guess
there's i-, advantages and disadvantages to moving into a new or old house.
Uh, one thing it had all of the window treatments, you know, so we didn't have
to --

B.24:  Right.

A.25:  -- do that. 

B.26:  [Child_yelling].  

A.27:  And it had been updated.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  But, their roof is old, was old, so, uh, last year we covered the wood
shingles with, uh, that composition.

B.30:  Uh-huh.

A.31:  And that wa-, cost a fortune [laughter].

B.32:  Oh, yeah.

A.33:  And, uh, now we're, we're in the process of, uh, repainting the interior
because we didn't paint when we first moved in.  And, uh, you know, when you
shop for houses you don't notice all the little things.  You think, oh, this
is beautiful and #everything [laughter].#

B.34:  #Yeah.#

A.35:  And then you find [laughter] out that it's,

B.36:  I wouldn't think about the painting.  

A.37:  You know, that it's not as great, well there is just a lot of, uh, I mean
it ha-, that, well, the family before us raised,

B.38:  [Child_yelling]. 

A.39:  three kids,

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #and a# dog and cats and,

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  And so there is just wear, wear and tear on the house.  But you don't
notice --

B.44:  Yeah.

A.45:  -- until you live in it and have to clean it [laughter].

B.46:  Yeah.

A.47:  You know, you, you find scratch marks on the wood or --

B.48:   [TV] Huh.

A.49:  -- you know, places were the dog chewed or,

B.50:  Yeah.

A.51:  I don't know.  Things like that.

B.52:  Yeah.  Because we're kind of thinking of, uh, trying to find a used home.
And, uh, the ones we've looked at have been really nice.  Um, but, you know,
there are some things you don't really think about looking at in a pre owned
home that, that you do in a new home so,

A.53:  I would say, uh, you know, that, uh, who is it the inspector, you know that
you use just, um, they have a list of things they go over.

B.54:  Uh-huh.

A.55:  But, you know, I think we had maybe a list on top of that, that some
friends ha-, of ours had told us to go through.  And just things that they
might not normally look for.

B.56:  #Uh-huh.#

A.57:  #And,# and go around with them and even if you're kind of on their, you
know, looking over their shoulder or whatever.

B.58:  Uh-huh.

A.59:  Uh, because there's lots of things that furniture hides and, you know.  We
have a place, we have picture frame paneling in our living room and it is in
beautiful condition.  It's, uh, it's a custom home that there's just areas
that they skimped on.

B.60:  Uh-huh.

A.61:  And, uh, but the, the, uh, picture frame paneling for the most part is
beautiful.  And, and they had this big arrangement on the mantel.  And it, and
I think one thing about the house that made us fall in love with it was their
decorating.

B.62:  #Oh, really?#

A.63:  #You know, their furniture.# Once you move in your furniture [laughter],

B.64:  [Laughter]  #Yeah.#

A.65:  #into the house it's kind of,# it doesn't have quite the same look.

B.66:  #Yeah.#

A.67:  #But, um,# because we're, u-, you know, we haven't been married, we've been
married for almost four years #and, uh,# 

B.68:  #Uh-huh.#

A.69:  [Cough] Anyway, but there is a piece of paneling behind that's above the
mantel but has, um --

B.70:  Yeah.

A.71:  -- it's right above the fireplace and I think they, there must have been
some water running down the chimney --

B.72:  Yeah.

A.73:  -- behind there because there is some water damage.

B.74:  Uh-huh.

A.75:  And it's warped.  And with it being picture frame, I don't know how to, how
to replace that one piece.

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  Without having to tear it,

B.78:  #Huh, yeah.#

A.79:  #all down because it's# one of the inset pieces.  So there's a lot of
things to, you know, to look for and,

B.80:  Yeah. 

A.81:  #Um,# 

B.82:  #[Lipsmack] Yeah.#

A.83:  But, I guess new homes are like that to.  They probably have things that
are constantly --

B.84:  Yeah.

A.85:  -- [Breathing] needing fixed.  Or at least you probably have to, I don't
know, did, did you all, did the builder provide the mini blinds and stuff like
that?  #Or did [/TV],#

B.86:  #Oh, no, no.  Huh-uh.#

A.87:  Yeah, you had to go purchase all that?

B.88:  Yeah, yeah.  From scratch, everything.  But we're trying to look for a
bigger home right now.  And, and,

A.89:  What si-, what size home are you in now?

B.90:  Right now we're in, um, seventeen hundred square feet.

A.91:  Uh-huh.

B.92:  So, it's, were looking for something a lot bigger because we have two kids.
And, uh, but I like Garland, I love Garland, I really want to stay in Garland
if I can.  But, [breathing] uh, you know, there's, there's other places too
like Sachse and that, and that area out there. [breathing] Which is really
nice.  I've been to some friend's house out there, and there's just,
[lipsmack] uh, there, there's some really nice homes out there.

A.93:  [Breathing] I'm not really familiar with the homes in Garland.  I guess I
know, uh, I tried,
