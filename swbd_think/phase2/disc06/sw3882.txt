A.1:  I, I don't have a lot of things that invade my, ev-, everyday privacy.
Probably the, the one thing that I feel is a, is a bother is, uh, soliciting
over the phone.  From, uh, here for donations for different things or in the
local area, uh, we have quite a bit of this.  I understand there's a, a law
now where some companies are unable to do this after the first of January, but
I haven't, I really don't know too much about that.  But I r-, other than that
I don't really have anything that, uh, I feel invades m-, my privacy.  How
about you?

B.2:  I feel that the mail is also, it's the telephones and the mails that get
me.  I think the mails, all these ads and,

A.3:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.4:  #things# that they send, 

A.5:  #Yeah.#  

B.6:  #and# there should be a limit on that also.  

A.7:  Yeah, tha-, that's good.  I, #I didn't think,# 

B.8:  #Not only# financially, but it's costing me and us, 

A.9:  #Yes, uh,#

B.10:  #really# in advertising.  We're paying for all that junk that we throw in
the,

A.11:  You bet.  And once you order something, it seems like you get on their list
and they #send everything.#

B.12:  #That's right, and they have a,#

A.13:  [Laughter]. 

B.14:  And then you get your list there ((of)) privacy, you know, out of that
comes the, um, and then, then being able to use your name.

A.15:  Uh-huh.  

B.16:  And that's invading your privacy.  

A.17:  #Uh-huh.#

B.18:  #To# me, now that is,

A.19:  #That's,# 

B.20:  #one# of the biggest on-, another big one.  

A.21:  Uh-huh.  #Yeah.#

B.22:  #Taking# your name from lists.  

A.23:  Uh, that, that's true and I don't know how you, you stop that.  If you
order anything at all and then use your credit card,

B.24:  #Uh-huh.#  

A.25:  #or get# anything from any mail-order catalogs or anything, then everybody
starts sending the stuff.

B.26:  I know it is.  It's outrageous,

A.27:  #Yeah.#

B.28:  #how# you get the piles of it, and, uh, and then it ev-, even gets to the
point where they, um, oh, they can mess up your credit bad with it.

A.29:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.30:  #You know,# as far as your, with your, um, when you get on all these lists
and all --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  -- they can invade that part of it.  

A.33:  Right.  

B.34:  #And,# 

A.35:  #And# I don't know what can be done about that but, uh, I'm sure that this
is,

B.36:  I know there is a number I think that, or, uh, the post office you can send
in a number and I don't have it myself.  In fact, I thought of getting it.  My
sister has it, and said we, she'd give it to me and she lives in Ohio.

A.37:  Uh-huh.  

B.38:  And, uh, there is a number that you can send or a place that you can send
to the post office and give them your address and tell them you don't want
anymore of this, and I just haven't done, in fact, she was just telling me
about it recently.

A.39:  Well, that's great.  That's good to hear.  #I'll,# 

B.40:  #So# I thought I might check with her on it and get that, 

A.41:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.42:  #number and# --

A.43:  Well, I have a son, 

B.44:  -- #and have a lot of,# 

A.45:  #and, uh, (( )),# 

B.46:  that junk mail stopped,

A.47:  #Uh-huh.#

B.48:  #because I really,# 

A.49:  #Yes.#

B.50:  #That,# 

A.51:  ((Well, that)), that would be great, #((I mean, you know.))# 

B.52:  #It's a big irritant# to me. 

A.53:  [Laughter] Yes, it is.  Like you say, we're paying for it one way or the
other,

B.54:  #Uh-huh.  We are.# 

A.55:  #in the postage and, uh,# and [breathing],

B.56:  And door-to-door soliciting -- 

A.57:  Uh-huh.  

B.58:  -- can be another.  

A.59:  [Lipsmack]  We don't have a lot of that, 

B.60:  #Don't you?# 

A.61:  #uh, where I# live.  Uh, very little, but I would imagine that where you
live in a,

B.62:  #Yeah, it's a,#  

A.63:  #larger area.# 

B.64:  it's as much as a phone call.  

A.65:  Uh-huh.  

B.66:  You know, invading your privacy, 

A.67:  #Well,# 

B.68:  #and# we do hear an-, a lot of it in Richardson there's quite a bit,

A.69:  #It,# 

B.70:  #of it.#  

A.71:  really would be, and, and, then the, that really invades it plus, uh, you
just, trying to settle down to do something and then, uh, here they come and
they,

B.72:  I did have to laugh though they had the, um, [lipsmack] they had the
invasion of privacy law, uh, for weekends now here in Richardson they ((signed
me to see)), uh, on Saturdays and Sundays there is no soliciting allo-,
allowed.

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  And they even stopped the little Brownies and Girl Scouts,  

A.75:  #Oh.# 

B.76:  #from# selling their cookies, 

A.77:  #Oh, my goodn-,# 

B.78:  #and that really# got us and we laughed about, 

A.79:  #Yeah.# 

B.80:  #it because# ((with)) one of the, um, editorials on it was it was great.
The guy went on about how the little Brownie cam-, or Girl Scout came to the
door and the police,

A.81:  #Yeah.#

B.82:  #arrested# her [laughter] for selling their cookies, 

A.83:  #Oh. wow.# 

B.84:  #and it was# kind of a cute -- 

A.85:  Yes.   

B.86:  -- pun against that part of it, but, you know, where do you stop?  It's
true.

A.87:  [Laughter] Uh, sure.  We must have, um, well I'm, I'm sure we have a law
in, uh, in Brigham City on that because, uh, we very seldom,

B.88:  #Really?# 

A.89:  #uh, have,# anyone coming around but,  

B.90:  #Oh, really?# 

A.91:  #once in a while,# somebody will come in and then, uh, the word gets out
and then nobody in the neighborhood will answer the door.

B.92:  Uh-huh.  

A.93:  But, uh -- 

B.94:  Oh, well that's good.  

A.95:  -- we don't have maybe, oh, two or three times a year.  So, 

B.96:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.97:  #there's,# there's got to be something, uh, I'm sure that, that prohibits
them from,

B.98:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.99:  #doing that.# 

B.100:  Uh-huh.  

A.101:  But, uh, [lipsmack] all of these are really irritants and things that we
really don't need.

B.102:  Now that's true.  

A.103:  [Lipsmack].

B.104:  And it is an inva-, and each time it's a breakdown -- 

A.105:  Uh-huh.  

B.106:  -- of our system.  You know each one is a breakdown of our systems --

A.107:  Yes.  

B.108:  -- of your priva-, your own privacy.  

A.109:  And, uh,

B.110:  That can be very irritable.  

A.111:  That's true.  And then some of the advertisements on television, some of
the things, uh, that you might want or records or something I ((dare sent,
uh,)) I ((dare sent)) order any of that stuff because then,
