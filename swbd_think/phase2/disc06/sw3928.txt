A.1:  How do you feel about drug testing (( ))?

@B.2:  Uh, I have no problem with it [laughter].

A.3:  Yeah.  Neither do I.  I think that, uh, it's something that, uh, uh, I, I
can appreciate if, uh, I were an employer or, uh, that, uh, I would want to,
uh, [throat_clearing] ascertain the state of the, uh, employee.

B.4:  Uh-huh.  

A.5:  Uh, I don't know that personally I would, you know, I've started a new job,
um, about a year and a half ago and of course had to go through the physical
and the test and, you know, didn't have any problem with it.  Now, one thing
I've never experienced is being randomly tested and while I, you know, don't
have a problem personally with it as far as passing the test --

B.6:  Uh-huh.  

A.7:  -- I don't know that I would relish being, you know, pulled out and said
hey, you know, roll up your sleeve or, or go use this jar.  But, uh, I think
that there's some companies that do that.

B.8:  Well I guess I particularly feel in fields such as airline pilots or people
who are involved in mass transportation --

A.9:  Yeah.  

B.10:  -- I definitely feel these people should be tested.  

A.11:  #Yeah.  That's# -- 

B.12:  #Particularly# in light of some of the accidents that have happened.

A.13:  -- that is a good point.  I don't want a, uh, uh, pilot hungover
[laughter].

B.14: [Laughter] ((If)) for many things [laughter].

A.15:  Yeah, #right.#  

B.16:  #Really.# 

A.17:  #Yeah.# 

B.18:  #Yes,# I agree with that.  

A.19:  Yeah.  

B.20:  Um, I guess, well, I'm very anti drugs.  And, uh, I guess it really doesn't
bother me whatever they have to do, you know, to, to keep the workplace or, or
the country or the world or whatever.  Drug free is fine with me.  I, I've
never been tested for drugs.  I've never worked for companies that required it
or anything, but it really wouldn't bother me a bit if they said, if someone
said, hey, we're going to start dr-, tes-, um, excuse me, testing for drugs.

A.21:  Yeah.  I have a friend of mine who works, uh, for a company in Atlanta.
[throat_clearing] And, uh, they, you know, made it clear about, you know,
policy that they were going to start the drug testing and then, you know,
advertised it about oh, four or five months he said even before they ever
started.  And, uh, he said one of his bosses was saying that, you know, should
someone test positive, that didn't necessarily mean that they would be fired,
and my friend said, well, they ought to fire him.  And he said, well, perhaps
that's, you know, this boss will, ((maybe that)) might be a little harsh.  And
he said, no, I'm not [laughter] talking about firing him for doing the drugs
I'm talking about firing him because he's so stupid that they would continue
to do it [laughter].

B.22:  [Laughter]  With that much #advance notice.#

A.23:  #With that# much adv-, exactly.  

B.24:  [Laughter].

A.25:  With that much advance notice you know if they are that dumb they ought to
get rid of them [laughter].

B.26:  [Laughter]. 

A.27:  So, I kind of liked his, uh, line of thinking.  

B.28:  Oh.  Well, I'm trying to think of something else we can talk about on this
conversation th-, 

A.29:  Yeah.  I don't know it's, it's something that, that, uh, I don't know I
think that the, [breathing] uh, and, and maybe I'm optimistic but I think to a
great extent, uh, uh, some of the, uh, casual use of, uh, the baby boomers
back, uh, you know, in the seventies and the eighties perhaps --

B.30:  Uh-huh.  

A.31:  -- is moderating.  Now certainly that doesn't mean that there's not still a
severe problem and especially with crack cocaine which I think is just a
scourge on society.  Uh, [lipsmack] but, uh, perhaps the recreational use
might be declining a little bit and I hope it is.

B.32:  Well, it's just so frightening when I hear of, of, uh, children in grade
school, you know, that are being exposed to this.  I, I would hate to be a
child today and have the peer pressure.

A.33:  Oh, yeah.  

B.34:  #Uh, from this,# 

A.35:  #Yeah.# 

B.36:  sort of thing.  

A.37:  Yeah, ((and then the one)), not only that I mean just everything.  ((I mean
it's)) --

B.38:  Right.  

A.39:  -- awesome to think of anyone raising children,

B.40:  #Uh-huh.#

A.41:  #to me# right now but,

B.42:  #Uh-huh.#

A.43:  #uh,# 

B.44:  Well, perhaps, uh, there will be a turnaround.  You know you hear the
statistics and they do say that it's looking better.  Now whether that's a
little bit of P R on the part of the government or what,

A.45:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.46:  #I don't know,# I, I, but I hope that they're correct.

A.47:  Yeah.  And at the same time I mean I, if, uh, with the cost of health care
and, uh, [lipsmack] just all the additional, uh, expenses of, of recruiting
employees, like I say, I can understand, uh, the necessity of being tested and
again that's only, only happened to me one time,

B.48:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.49:  #but, uh,# I didn't, I didn't feel badly about it at all.  I was more than
happy to, uh, uh, submit to the test.

B.50:  Well at least you know that the company you're working for is doing
something to, uh, increase productivity or what because I think that, you
know, is part of it, uh, looking to make sure that they have productive
employees because it appears to me that people that are on drugs aren't really
all that productive.

A.51:  Yeah.  Right.  Or certainly not working up to their full potential.

B.52:  For sure [laughter]. 

A.53:  Yeah.  [laughter] But, um, [throat_clearing] well, I don't know it's, we're
in such a perfect harmony on this topic [laughter].

B.54:  I know we ha-, [laughter],

@@A.55:  And I do know that we need to keep to the topic so let's see what else,
