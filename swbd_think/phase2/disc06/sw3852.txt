A.1:  Okay, Ron.  

B.2:  Okay.

@A.3:  Welcome to the net and, uh, what did you do about your last auto repair,
oh, and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth.

B.4:  Well, Larry, my last one, unfortunately, was a, an expensive one because I
had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and --

A.5:  Um.

B.6:  -- and a couple of ladies ran a stop light, the lights weren't working
properly, it wasn't their fault, but we, they didn't run it.  We both had
green, and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to
my car, so.

A.7:  My goodness gracious that's,

B.8:  That was a huge repair bill.

A.9:  Well, that's still not enough for a total, is it.

B.10:  I know, I hated that.

A.11:  It's a very expensive automobile.

B.12:  So it wasn't enough to total it, but that's my, that's been my most, uh,
expensive repair probably in the last year, with the except of just service
work, because I buy a new car every two years and,

A.13:  Oh, and do you buy one every two years?

B.14:  Well, I travel a lot, so --

A.15:  Uh-huh.

B.16:  -- you know, uh, this last one I leased, so I don't know, and I leased it
on a twenty-four month program.  First time I've ever done that.  But I'll
probably go back to buying them, because I don't care to lease them
[laughter].

A.17:  Did this car have one of these expanding balloons, or just are there normal
safety belts in it, that you had.

B.18:  No, it has the expanding balloons.

A.19:  Did that help you?

B.20:  Uh, it, they didn't go off.

A.21:  They didn't go off.

B.22:  No, I guess we weren't going, that sort of upset me, we weren't going fast
enough acco-, when I called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor
about it, but, no, sir, didn't go off, uh, we were --

A.23:  (( )).

B.24:  -- it was a bad, rainy, dark, dreary day, and, and the street lights.

A.25:  But you were hit in the side, weren't you?

B.26:  Yes.

A.27:  That may be the problem.  You, you may, you may need to be hit from
something the, leaning towards the forward --

B.28:  Yes.

A.29:  -- to activate it.

B.30:  Took off my whole front fender and hood and everything.  I tell you,
just --

A.31:  My goodness.

B.32:  -- took it all off.  It was uh, uh, my doors were okay front and back --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  -- but it did, uh, right eleven thousand dollars in damage.  It was a
expen-, then I get it back and two weeks after that, I'm driving it in front
of the local high school, and some young man just wasn't paying any attention
and runs in the back of me.  That's another twelve hundred dollars worth of
damage [laughter].

A.35:  My goodness.

B.36:  So, I'm going to get, when my twenty-four months is up on this car, I'm
getting rid of this car.

A.37:  I would think so [laughter].

B.38:  #[Laughter].#

A.39:  #This doesn't sound like you've got# very good luck with that one.

B.40:  My golly.  How about you, Larry?

A.41:  Well, I'm relatively fortunate about that.  Uh, here we, somehow, don't
have many people run into us, although at the beginning of each school season,
uh, students move into town who are from big cities, and they sort of drive
kind of wild for about two, three weeks, then they finally settle down and,

B.42:  #[Laughter].#

A.43:  #realize that they don't have to# drive that way here.

B.44:  I understand.

A.45:  And, now that takes the strain out, off of everyone that, uh, is driving a
vehicle, and I find that the most of the repairs I have to do here is body
damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to, uh, take care of us
in the winter time.

B.46:  I understand.

A.47:  Uh, I have a sixty-nine cougar and a seventy-seven pontiac, so forth, and I
have to, and I drive a Honda most of the time, and [noise] {sounds like hand
over the telephone receiver} I have to make sure that, uh, salt and so forth
are kept off of it, and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates
in the bottom of it --

B.48:  Sure.

A.49:  -- because it's rusted away.

B.50:  I understand that because I'm from West Virginia, and we had the same thing
up there continuously salting the roads for snow.

A.51:  Uh-huh.  Well, I just, I di-, I had this Cougar totally, uh, the body of
it, totally rebuilt, uh, to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders --

B.52:  Sure.

A.53:  -- uh, done, and then it all repainted, and then [laughter] winter got here
and so I put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off,

B.54:  [Laughter].

A.55:  [Noise] {sounds like hand over the telephone receiver} so I haven't had a
chance to drive it very much [laughter].  But, anyhow, uh, now, are you going
to buy this next car or you going rent it, lease it again?

B.56:  No, I'm going to, I'm going to buy it, Larry, I don't like the rental, I
think, I'm getting ready to retire myself, and --

A.57:  Are you?

B.58:  -- I'm going to, I'm going to be, you know, driving a car for longer, so, I
usually drive a car for three years, and --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- and anyway, and so, but last couple of cars I've only driven for two
years, and so I'd leased this one for two years.  So I'll probably go back and
buy one, and, uh, this next car will probably be my retirement car.

A.61:  Well, that's an awfully big one, that, uh, that one that you had, that
Lincoln, uh, isn't it too large for normal town driving, finding parking
places --

B.62:  #Well, no sir.#

A.63:  -- #and getting in and out the doors?#

B.64:  Not really, #not really# --

A.65:  #Uh-huh.#

B.66:  -- uh, no problem at all.  My wife and daughter, we have, uh, two Toyotas
in the family, one Nissan, and then we have the Lincoln and the --

A.67:  Uh.

B.68:  -- not really, no problem there at all as fin-, as far as finding parking
places, it's --

A.69:  Yeah.

B.70:  -- it's convenient in that, in that regard.

A.71:  Well, that certainly would be a wonderful, comfortable machine to take on
long trips --

B.72:  Yes, it is.  And I --

A.73:  -- I'm, I'm very much aware of that.

B.74:  -- and I travel, I'm like a traveling salesman, don't travel a lot any
more, but, uh, when I do take it, it is very comfortable to drive.

A.75:  Yes, I'm sure it is, because that's the way that I enjoy this Pontiac that
I have.

B.76:  Yes it's,

A.77:  It only has thirty-eight thousand miles on #it, but it's# --

B.78:  #Is that right?#

A.79:  -- very quiet and very smooth riding machine.

B.80:  Well, my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old, it only has, doesn't
even have thirty mil-, thirty thousand miles on it, so, gosh, been much, in
such good shape, that'll probably be an eight or ten year car.

A.81:  Uh-huh.  Do you, do you feel that, uh,
