============================================================================

B.1:  So, okay.  So what is the subject now?

A.2:  It's on the the time we spend with our children.

@B.3:  Okay.  Well let me tell you about our our situation.  Uh, --

A.4:  Okay.

B.5:  -- [Sniffing] we have two girls, uh, one is twelve, one is, uh, uh, eleven
--

A.6:  Uh-huh.

B.7:  -- and I have got, uh, two sons that are, [children] uh, six and three.

A.8:  Uh-huh.

B.9:  And, uh, between the four, uh, my two girls play a lot of soccer and we
travel a lot with them and they are either practicing or playing and, and it is
really tough to fit everything in.

A.10:  Uh-huh.

B.11:  And, uh, you know, I am not real sure what your situation is, if, uh, you
have any kids that are still at home, but [sniffing],

A.12:  Uh, we just, uh, well we have the one that, uh, has left.  Uh --

B.13:  Uh-huh.

A.14:  -- but, he was here a year ago and, uh, he was involved in wres-, wrestling
along with my three older sons.

B.15:  Oh, is that right.

A.16:  We had six children --

B.17:  Uh-huh.

A.18:  -- and our oldest son, our second son is, uh, he is a doctor and he was All
State in wrestling [laughter].

B.19:  [Sniffing]  [noise].

A.20:  And then my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling.

B.21:  Oh.

A.22:  So we had two in our family, but we had a lot of participation with them
and I know what you are talking about where, it is difficult to find time.
But, I, I feel it is very important that you support the kids as much as you
can you and, uh --

B.23:  You bet.

A.24:  -- the spouse because, uh, when my, well both sons, uh, when they were
wrestling, they kind of looked up to see if we were in the audience and then
that is the last #they paid any attention to us# --

B.25:  #It sure makes a big difference,# doesn't it.

A.26:  -- till after the game is over, right, and the wrestling match.

B.27:  [Laughter].

A.28:  And, uh, we've really enjoyed it, uh, to be involved with our, our children
and #I# --

B.29:  #Yes.#

A.30:  -- think it is very important.  That's something that the parents today --

B.31:  [Sniffing].

A.32:  -- and, uh, there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult --

B.33:  Yep.

A.34:  -- I think with, with Church and everything else that you're doing but, uh,
that is where our family relationship is really built and,

B.35:  It sure is.

A.36:  It's, uh, then they've,

B.37:  We have, uh, in fact this this past, uh, Christmas we went out to
California.

A.38:  Uh-huh.

B.39:  Uh, both my girls were involved in tournaments out there. 

A.40:  Uh-huh.

B.41:  So we went out there and we spent Christmas with my wife's family out there
in California, then, uh, we drove out to or down to southern California and
had the tournament and went to Disneyland as a family and just kind of, you
know, spent time together that way.

A.42:  Well super.  Those are things they will never forget and, uh, they know
they are loved when that takes place {females talking softly and laughing}.

B.43:  Yeah.

A.44:  And that you are supporting them.  There are so many families that I know
about today that they just don't, uh, take [noise] time to do anything with
their children.

B.45:  You get.  My wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful.

A.46:  Oh good.  Good.  Well we're going to try to get down to, hopefully for his,
uh, uh, the oldest ones, uh, baptism and then the grandson's,

B.47:  [Sniffing].

A.48:  uh, our youngest [tone] to get his, uh, #to the blessing.#

B.49:  #They, be blessed.#

A.50:  But, I don't know whether we will make it or not.  We are going to give it
a shot, but that's coming up.

B.51:  Yeah, I know that would mean a lot to, to Brian.  He is a heck of a
nice guy.

A.52:  Well.

B.53:  I really enjoy, uh, being friends with him.  He's,

A.54:  I appreciate that.  He was a super son and when he was wrestling, uh, 

B.55:  [Sniffing].

A.56:  we had two sons wrestling and we, uh, one week we went to twelve wrestling
matches in one week.

B.57:  Is that right [laughter]?

A.58:  Yeah once.  The oldest, his older brother was in college,

B.59:  [Sniffing].

A.60:  and he was in high school and we would get, get to all of those.

B.61:  When did he find time to learn how to do brakes?  He just helped me do my
brakes.

A.62:  [Laughter].

B.63:  [Laughter].

A.64:  Well, he, he is very talented in all kinds of things. #Uh, he's not# --

B.65:  #Yeah,# he is.

A.66:  -- like his dad.  He can do about anything.  

B.67:  Yeah.

A.68:  And, uh, we really miss him being in Texas.

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  So anyway,

B.71:  Well, that's great.  Yeah.  Um, my work, uh, fortunately, my work doesn't
take me away from [sniffing] this area, so, I have, uh, I have some time.  I
own my own business out here.

A.72:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's super.

B.73:  So, I have some time to just spend with them, you know, whenever the time,
whenever they need me but, uh, I know that there is quite a few [tone] people
in our family that, uh, or in our [tone] area that, uh, [tone] work outside and
they have even [tone] a tougher time trying to [noise], uh, schedule time with
[tone] their family.

@@A.74:  Uh-huh.  Yep.  [tone] Well, be sure and tell Diane "Hello"
and it has been a pleasure talking to you [tone].  It sounds like our time
[tone] is up and, uh, give him the best from, uh, his dad [tone].

B.75:  Okay, I'm, I am not sure if our time is up or [tone] my phone just went out
#of# --

A.76:  #Oh.#

B.77:  -- out of whack.

A.78:  Oh, I see.  Okay.

B.79:  [Sniffing]  I think that was just my phone.

A.80:  I've, I've this is the first call so I don't know what happens when the
time is up,

B.81:  Well, well, they'll come back on and #tell us when# --

A.82:  #Oh, I see.#

B.83:  -- the time's up.

A.84:  Okay. Fine.

B.85:  Yeah, there should be another couple minutes.  So.

A.86:  Of course, Church involvement I think is very important too, but, uh,
parents supporting their children and taking them to Church and going with
them.

B.87:  Uh-huh.  Oh yeah.

A.88:  That's another activity [noise] that, uh, time is spent.

B.89:  Well, I think that's, that is probably more important than,
