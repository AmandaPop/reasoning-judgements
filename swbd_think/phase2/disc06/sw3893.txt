======================================================================

A.1:   So, have you had a project recently?

B.2:   Well, as ab-, as a matter of fact about two years ago right
now, uh, I've completely and totally remodeled and restored my
kitchen.

A.3:   That's a project.

B.4:   Yeah.  I, uh, I tore out the, uh, walls all the way down to
the studs --

A.5:   Uh-huh.

B.6:   -- and started over.  We had, had a, uh, the kitchen we've, we
had was, um, it had a paneling in it, dark paneling,

A.7:   #Uh-huh.#

B.8:   #and,# and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark
in here and old cabinets and, uh, counter tops.  At first I wa-, we
were just going to paint the thing and you know how everything just
sort of grows.

A.9:   Yes.

B.10:   And, uh, so I ended up just, just tearing out the whole place
and, uh, putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with
ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything.

A.11:   #You mu-,#

B.12:   #New floor# [laughter],

A.13:   you must be pretty handy.

B.14:   Well, uh, I'm fairly good at it not, not, not enough to be
professional or anything but I can do my own.

A.15:   So you did the tile counter tops.

B.16:   Yeah.  Uh-huh.

A.17:   How do you like that?

B.18:   I love that.  It's, it's really pretty.  We had just, uh,
formica, [swallowing] and when I built the new cabinets, uh, I
looked into this tile deal and I thought, well, you know, I think
we can probably do this.

A.19:   Uh-huh.

B.20:   And, um, it was, uh, it was not e-, not hard at all.  Um, it
just, I just followed the instructions, the basic instructions that
you use with the tile and --

A.21:   Uh-huh.

B.22:   -- uh, they're not hard at all, really it's just about anybody
can do that.

A.23:   Did you have, or do you have any problem with staining of the
grout?

B.24:   No, not at all.  Um, uh, what we, what I've been doing is just
using some like bleach --

A.25:   Uh-huh.

B.26:   -- and it, uh, gets it clean.  But it does, it has browned
over the, the couple of years.

A.27:   Uh-huh.

B.28:   You know, but it really don't look that bad even though it has
gotten brown, you know.  What I should have done now that I think
about it was used brown colored grout.

A.29:   And just start out with that and,

B.30:   That's right.

A.31:   #Uh-huh.#

B.32:   #That's right.#  You know, because it does stain some, you
know, you could whiten it but I never have [laughter].

A.33:   [Laughter]  Well how long did it take you to complete this?

B.34:   Um, about three months, probably, three or four months.

A.35:   That's not bad considering you did it yourself,

B.36:   #Yeah, yeah.#

A.37:   #although# I'm sure it was a real pain to have to live, you
know, with everything,

B.38:   Well, it was for a while.  The worst part about it was we had
to do it, when I got to the sink part over here, what I did was I
left this cabinet just about, this one wall where the sink is to
the very last.

A.39:   Uh-huh.

B.40:   And, uh, I figured, well, you know, I'll remodel the rest of
the kitchen and then when we get to that point, I'll do that last
because w-, so we can keep the sink as long as possible.

A.41:   Uh-huh.

B.42:   And then we ha-, we were without a sink about a week or a week
and a half or so.  And, uh, what we had to do was just take the
dishes and, uh, put them in a big dish pan --

A.43:   Uh-huh.

B.44:   -- and yo-, get water from the bath tub, and then rinse them
in, you know fo-, with the bath wa-, not, not in the tub
[laughter].

A.45:   No, I know what you mean [laughter].

B.46:  But you're just letting it run under there, you know [laughter].

A.47:   Sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didn't
cook for about #three,#

B.48:   #Real-, really.#  [laughter]

A.49:   months [laughter].

B.50:   Yeah, we did eat out a lot.

A.51:   Did you have any major catastrophes or anything?

B.52:   Not a thing, not a thing.  I almost thought I had cut through
a water pipe in the wall.

A.53:   Uh-huh.

B.54:   But I didn't, I just nicked it a little bit.  It wasn't all
the way through [laughter].

A.55:   [Laughter].

B.56:   And now that was about it.

A.57:   Well, that's quite an undertaking, #you know.#

B.58:   #Yeah.#  Well have you, have you done anything like that,

A.59:   Well, nothing that,

B.60:   #or, or anything smaller or,#

A.61:   #big a deal.#  My husband did, uh, he made a cedar closet and
shelving out in the garage --

B.62:   Uh-huh.

A.63:   -- uh, for us which, really was nice.  Um, I don't know how it
is in Biloxi we, Dallas has no basements.  I suspect Biloxi,

B.64:   Oh, no, no, there is nothing like that here either.

A.65:   Yeah, well, we come from the midwest where there's basements
#and, you know,#

B.66:   #Uh-huh.#

A.67:   so you have to make storage [noise] were you can.

B.68:   Oh, yeah.

A.69:   And, uh, he bought the sheeting, uh, the cedar sheeting and
put that in.  And I #didn't know,#

B.70:   #Yeah.#

A.71:   for certain how that wou-, you know, how that would work out, 
if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out.  But --

B.72:   Sure.

A.73:   -- it's been great.  We haven't had any problems with moths or
anything.  And the extra, he finished the outside, painted it to
match the, uh, garage wall #which is white and,#

B.74:   #Right, right.#

A.75:   it's just beautiful.  It really added a whole lot, you know,
storage wise to the house.  

B.76:   Oh sure, yeah, it does.

A.77:   But, uh, I think the only glitches he ran into on that, I put
a few nails in it so I consider myself a partner in #that.#

B.78:   #That's# right, you are.

A.79:   [Laughter]  But, 

B.80:   And you're half and half [laughter].

A.81:  Yeah, right.  The only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the
doors he had to put in, oh, like some extra closure because even though he
thought that the, uh, the plywood that he got was straight --

B.82:   Yeah.

A.83:   -- somehow the humidity, or something, warped it a little bit
while he was building it --

B.84:   Oh.

A.85:   -- and we have to have a little closing, you know, to hold it
down at the bottom.

B.86:   Oh, I understand.  Yeah, a little latch like?

A.87:   Uh-huh.

B.88:   Yeah, right.

A.89:   But that was about it.  But our house in only four years old
so we haven't done, you know, just a whole lot to it #at this
point.#

B.90:   #Well, yeah.#  Yeah, everything is still so brand new.

A.91:   Uh-huh.  #Although,#

B.92:   #Yeah.#

A.93:   we're talking about adding, uh, the, the ceilings here are
high and the #pitch of,#

B.94:   #Uh-huh.#

A.95:   the, uh, roofs are very high.  And we are talking about
adding, like some rooms up in the attic space.

B.96:   Oh, I see.

A.97:   Because there is so much #space up there.#

B.98:   #Well, yeah,# sure.

A.99:   But, uh, I don't know that that is something we will undertake
ourselves.  Part #of it,#

B.100:   #No.#

A.101:   we'll probably do.  #You, know,#

B.102:   #Yeah.#

A.103:   like #hanging the,#

B.104:   #Now something# like that, I would probably have hi-, have to
hire,
