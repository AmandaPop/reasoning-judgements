A.1:  Are we tonight? 

B.2:  Yeah.  Sure.

A.3:  Okay, well let me go ahead and press one [beep].  Okay, Leslie, I'd like to
find out a little bit about your hobbies.  What do you like to do in your
spare time?

@B.4:  Well, and when I have my spare time [laughter],

A.5:  [Laughter].

B.6:  I do enjoy,

A.7:  Actually, it's a cherished commodity now days, huh.

B.8:  That's right.  Uh, I do enjoy, uh, sewing, I hand, uh, I do some
needlepoint.

A.9:  Oh, great.

B.10:  And I, I've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law, but if I, uh, ever
get enough spare time,

A.11:  [Laughter].

B.12:  he might see it one day.

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  And some other things I like to do are, is music and, uh, also reading.

A.15:  What kind of music?

B.16:  Well I enjoy singing.

A.17:  Oh, okay.

B.18:  Yeah.

A.19:  Well great.  I enjoy music too and I, uh, one thing that I like to do, uh,
is sit down and play the piano.  I can't play that well, but I, uh, sit down
and enjoy playing musical selections that I am familiar with.

B.20:  Um.

A.21:  My fam-, my family is familiar with.  I enjoy that.  

B.22:  Uh-huh.

A.23:  Uh, a couple of hobbies that I also have is, uh, I really enjoy bike riding
and the biggest hobbies I have right now are my kids and whatever they are
involved in.

B.24:  Yes.

A.25:  Like my, uh, oldest boy is involved in soccer so we go out and play kick
the soccer ball around or play throw the football and, uh, we also like to,
uh, ride bicycles.  So we're riding bicycles and so a lot of the hobbies that
I have right now are centered around my, my children and also things that my
wife and I like to do --

B.26:  Uh-huh.

A.27:  -- together.  And uh, so personally [laughter] a lot of the hobbies I had
when I was growing up and, uh, going to college and so forth are having to
change.

B.28:  Uh-huh.

A.29:  I really enjoyed, uh, mountain climbing.  I really enjoyed skiing.  Uh, and
a lot of outdoor activities.  Uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in
Texas --

B.30:  [Laughter]  That's right.

A.31:  -- that I can go skiing with that right now, but hopefully I will be able
to get back to the slopes some day but,

B.32:  Oh yeah.  I have not had the opportunity to go skiing but, uh, I grew up in
Arizona which has some mountains around it but --

A.33:  Uh-huh.

B.34:  --  uh, never did get out and ski [laughter].

A.35:  You didn't?

B.36:  No, I never did. 

A.37:  [Laughter].

B.38:  Didn't have the, uh, I guess I didn't have the person out there saying hey
let me take you skiing and of course, I was at that you know stage of my life
where I had to be taken to p-, places.  I couldn't go by myself.

A.39:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.

B.40:  And then of course, once I got to the age where I could have done it
myself, I had other interests I guess.  So [laughter].

A.41:  [Laughter] Oh yeah.  I guess that for me it was very helpful.  My two
oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.

B.42:  Oh yeah.

A.43:  And so we, we went quite often and, uh, in fact my brother still does a lot
of skiing.  When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from
Chicago and we would go skiing and enjoy that.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  So, but, uh, luckily it's kind of unusual because hobbies, it's a, it's a
nice thing to have and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have
time to.  Like you mentioned and I am finding out, a lot of the spare time
that I had isn't there.

B.46:  That's right.

A.47:  It's, uh, it's, uh, taken up by activities with, uh, work, with family,
with, uh, civic and Church responsibilities for me.

B.48:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.49:  So,

B.50:  Yeah, I, I find if I, I make I have to make myself realize that it is
important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good
recreation for me [laughter].

A.51:  [Laughter]  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah {very faint}.

B.52:  Yeah. And my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer so she's
real excited about doing that.

A.53:  Well, great.

B.54:  We will be busy with that again.

A.55:  What, again.  So you have participated with that in the past?

B.56:  Pardon me?

A.57:  Have you par-, participated in that #in the past?#

B.58:  #Well, I# did with my older daughter --

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- and she was in it for a few years, but she has got so many interests
herself that,

A.61:  [Laughter].

B.62:  we had to start eliminating and well the first one to go.  She still likes
her piano --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and she is in band.  So, she's got lots of hobbies or, uh, activities
going on.

A.65:  It sounds like her life is full too.

B.66:  Yeah.

A.67:  I imagine your life is full [laughter] --

B.68:  Very much.

A.69:  -- taking them around all over the place.

B.70:  That's right [laughter].  That's right.

@@A.71:  All right.  All right.  Well, Leslie, it's been very nice talking to you.
