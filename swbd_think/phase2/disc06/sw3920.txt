=======================================================================

B.1:  Yeah, I, uh, I, that's kind of a controversial issue here in the nation's
capitol.  I think we're becoming known as the murder capitol --

A.2:  Uh-huh.

B.3:  -- and so there is a lot of emphasize on gun control.  Uh, I am not exactly
sure where I stand because, uh, I feel that it may be necessary with the crime
coming out this way but we'd be allowed to, uh, the necessary facilities to
protect ourselves --

A.4:  Uh-huh.

B.5:  -- and I do know that the District of Columbia has a gun control law and it
seems that the number of shootings has gone up since they invoked the law.

A.6:  It, oh, I see.  Yeah well I,

B.7:  The criminals all have guns now.

A.8:  Right.  Well, they they can get them one way or the other.  I, I think its,
uh, I probably rate it, maybe on the scale of one to ten, maybe, uh, seven or
eight.  Uh, I think well the automatic weapons and these assault weapons and
all of these things that, uh, I think that is something that, uh, [cough]
really be limited, but like you say if they take, uh, they have uh, gun
control then they take away the citizens right to protect themselves and we
live out in the west where, uh, of course, I have a number of guns and each
one of my sons have guns and we go hunting quite a bit for deer and, uh, uh,
pheasants and things like that and, uh, they impose a gun control law that
would really be disastrous I think cause, I think the criminals will get guns
no matter what.

B.9:  Uh-huh.

A.10:  Where if we are restricted from having them, uh, or registering them all so
that everybody knows who's got them, I, I don't feel, I think that would
really take away from our, our, uh, rights and freedom as as citizens to to
bear arms and protect our selves --

B.11:  Yeah.

A.12:  -- if necessary.

B.13:  Well, we have, uh, well in Fairfax county it is against the law to
discharge a firearm.

A.14:  Uh-huh.

B.15:  In fact I think it's against the law to discharge a bow and arrow
[laughter].

A.16:  Oh my God. 

B.17:  Uh, but the, uh, we don't have any real strong gun control law.

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  Whereas just over the border in the District, they, they have a real
strong gun control law.  Fairfax County is fairly peaceful and, uh, the
District of Columbia is averaging about two murders a day.

A.20:  Oh boy.  Yeah, that I, I've read about that.  That is really tragic.  I
don't know how you could stop that.  I, I [cough] that would be terrible.  I
mean, uh, you don't even know whether you want to go to Washington, D C.

B.21:  Yeah.  Well, uh, we, I fortunately work out in the suburbs.

A.22:  Uh-huh.

B.23:  And, uh, I just don't go downtown at night.

A.24:  No. No.

B.25:  And, uh, a little bit reluctant to go in the day time.

A.26:  Uh-huh.

B.27:  And there have been a few occasions that I can remember a few years back, I
was downtown and, uh, toward quitting time, I decided since I was there I would
go visit one of my favorite stores --

A.28:  Uh-huh.

B.29:  -- and it was about six thirty when I left the, uh, store and I was walking
back to my car and boy I tell you, I got spooked.

A.30:  Oh wow.

B.31:  There were you know people in the alleys making noises at you and people
lying around in the park and it was dark and I, I just got scared [laughter].
I wound up running back to the car.

A.32:  Yes, you would.  Well I know out here, uh, apparently, they've apparently,
uh, well they've [cough] excuse me, in the Utah area they have uh, the women,
I guess the women and doctors, they had a hostage situation at one of, Alta
View Hospital in Salt Lake City where uh, a fellow came in with a gun and he,
uh, killed one of the nurses and held the hostages, uh, all night until they
finally, finally got him but, uh, so what they are saying now in the papers
that there has been, uh, uh, big increase in nurses and doctors that are buying
hand guns to protect themselves.

B.33:  Yeah.

A.34:  Because of this situation that happened.  And it doesn't, it hasn't
happened very often but, uh, again that's, it's, you hate to do that but, uh,
we're starting to get gangs and they are coming out here and there have been a
few shootings, uh, drive by shootings and these (( )),

B.35:  Yeah.  We've we've had a lot of drive-by shootings.  We had a few people
arrested for it.  Going out and shooting just because they felt like killing
somebody.

A.36:  Yeah.

B.37:  Just shooting at random.  I am kind of sorry to hear that.  That's it
happening in nice rural Utah cause, uh,

A.38:  Well, it, it's not bad yet.  But, uh there is, it is happened.  We, we had
one of our football coaches at one of the high schools in Salt Lake City that,
uh, I guess they were out on the practice field, uh, last fall and a couple of
gangs were involved and they shot him in the leg.

B.39:  Huh.

A.40:  And, uh, it's, it [cough] the police course were quite,
