========================================================================

A.1:  Well, so what do you think they are going to do next year?

B.2:  Well, I was pretty encouraged by what happened this year and --

A.3:  Yeah.

B.4:  -- and I think with all those draft choices that I hear that they have, uh,
they ought to be able to pick up a few more players that would help them.

A.5:  That's right.

B.6:  So, I'd, I'd have to say that I think that the J J BOYS have done well.

A.7:  [Laughter]  Well, which quarterback did you like better?

B.8:  Oh I, I don't think there is any question that Aikman has to be the starter
--

A.9:  Yeah.

B.10:  -- because he's got the physical tools.  I --

A.11:  Yeah.

B.12:  -- mean that other Beuerlein stepped in and did a wonderful job --

A.13:  Yeah.  I want,

B.14:  -- but I don't think that you can, until Troy loses the job on his own
merits, I think the job has to be his now that he is healthy again.

A.15:  That's right.

B.16:  #Unless# --

A.17:  #I like,# 

B.18:  -- he doesn't perform.  Then I guess the other guy is waiting to step in
the,

A.19:  [Laughter].

B.20:  wings.

A.21:  That's right.  That's his dream, huh [noise].

B.22:  #But# --

A.23:  #Yeah, I like the way,# 

B.24:  -- but that guy's got his head screwed on right.  He's not causing a
controversy.

A.25:  See, that's what I was just saying.  I like the way he [noise] handles the
press also.  He's just under control --

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  -- on the field and off.

B.28:  He said he'd hit the first reporter that says the word, quarterback
controversy [Laughter].

A.29:  [Laughter]  Well, that's been said plenty of times.  So,

B.30:  Yeah and, uh, but he, he doesn't like it.  He doesn't want that.  He just
wants to go out and do his job.  When he gets a chance to play, he kind of, I
think wants to let his actions --

A.31:  Speak for themselves.

B.32:  -- speak for themselves, pretty much.

A.33:  Yeah.  So are, uh, have you been from here all along?  Or did you,

B.34:  Yeah, I am a Dallas native.

A.35:  Oh.

B.36:  So, I have kind of grown up watching --

A.37:  Yeah.  Well you are a unique one.

B.38:  -- and I even went to S M U so I didn't even go away,

A.39:  [Laughter].

B.40:  for college.  So I, I --

A.41:  Where did you grow up?

B.42:  -- in, uh, north Dallas, in Lake Highlands --

A.43:  Yeah.

B.44:  -- area.

A.45:  Huh.

B.46:  Richardson School District.

A.47:  So, you have always been a Dallas fan.

B.48:  Yeah.  I was in the Dallas Cowboy Quarterback Club --

A.49:  Is that right?

B.50:  -- when they started it back in nineteen sixty.  I was, uh, just a little
kid then and I use to go to the games and sit in the end zone for a buck of
something,

A.51:  [Laughter].

B.52:  for, this little club thing they had.

A.53:  Huh.  Did you play yourself?

B.54:  I played in, uh, up through about seventh grade.

A.55:  Uh-huh.

B.56:  And I was not big enough to keep [noise] getting killed out there.
[laughter] Uh,

A.57:  Yeah.  Yeah.  See I came from the San Francisco area, so I got I
really liked the Oakland Raiders when they were there, but then we kind of had
to #switch loyalties to [laughter].#

B.58:  #Now you've got to be a# Joe Man, Montana fan a little now, huh [laughter].

A.59:  Yeah.  Well, as much of Montana as you can see anymore, I guess [laughter].

B.60:  Yeah, well he's, uh, had a tough year, but I think he will probably come
back.

A.61:  Do you think so?

B.62:  Yeah.  I,  

A.63:  There's lots of speculation whether he will or not [noise].

B.64:  You know, if his doctor's give him the green light.  I, I think he will
more than likely play again but,

A.65:  Yeah.  Well, well they sure went down hill without him.

B.66:  Yeah.  To a certain extent.  You know, they sure have got, uh, they get the
best back up in the league.

A.67:  Yeah.

B.68:  But Steve Young, but I don't think that you can throw all of San
Francisco's lack of getting through this year to the quarterback --

A.69:  Montana.

B.70:  -- I think it's been, I think it's been a variety of things.  They have had
several key injuries in certain spots and a couple close ball games could have
gone one way or another --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  -- and, and, uh, they are still one of the premier, uh, four or five teams
--

A.73:  Yeah.

B.74:  -- in the league and they're always one to beat.

A.75:  Yes.

B.76:  So I don't think there is going to be any question.  They are going to be
up there again.

A.77:  [Noise]  Yeah.  Well,

B.78:  Another thing is some of their guys are getting a little older --

A.79:  Yeah.

B.80:  -- cause they have,

A.81:  [Throat_clearing].

B.82:  been up there for a while.

A.83:  Well there is not much to talk about as far as where we think the teams are
heading this year but [laughter],

B.84:  Not since the season is over [laughter].

A.85:  [Laughter]  Kind of a silly topic, but [inhaling],

B.86:  What I have been watching lately is the, uh, [noise] potential draft coming
up, as the players declaring which every time another good player throws his
name in that means the draft is going to be that much stronger and I have been
watching the, uh, [noise] commitments of the high school players to the
colleges --

A.87:  Oh.

B.88:  -- lately cause that is going on.  National signing day is coming up next
week.

A.89:  It is.

B.90:  When they can sign their letter of intent as to what college they want to
go to --

A.91:  Yeah.

B.92:  -- so I have been watching to see if S M U was going to get a few good
players cause,

A.93:  [Laughter].

B.94:  they have been kind of struggling along.

A.95:  Yeah.

B.96:  Since their #death penalty thing.#

A.97:  #But do,# do you follow S M U football?

B.98:  Yeah, I have season tickets.

A.99:  [Throat_clearing].

B.100:  So, I go to all of the games.

A.101:  Yeah, I would say you follow them pretty closely then.

B.102:  Well, I was in the band there.  I, uh, was part of the spirit of the campus
for a long time --

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  -- and, uh, we have a section of band alumni that all sits together called
the Diamond M club.

A.105:  Huh.  How fun.

B.106:  So, we get the same season tickets every year and so we're, uh, we're all
there and it's its' just kind of fun, but --

A.107:  Yeah.

B.108:  -- it.  I've got a son seventeen years old and he's going to be going off
to Rice in the fall --

A.109:  Oh.

B.110:  -- and he wants to play in the the Mob, the marching L band,

A.111:  [Laughter].

B.112:  down there.  So I imagine I will be making a few trips to Houston,

A.113:  [Laughter].

B.114:  or following them a couple of places to see him play.

A.115:  Yeah.  How many kids do you have?

B.116:  Just one.

A.117:  Oh, that's going to be, uh, a lonely house for you next year. 

B.118:  How about you.  Have you got any?

A.119:  I have four.

B.120:  Oh, wow.

A.121:  But they're little.  I mean my oldest one is just [noise] thirteen so,

B.122:  Yeah.  #But,# 

A.123:  #I've# got a ways to go before they leave me [laughter].

B.124:  What part of town do you live in?

A.125:  I live in Plano.

B.126:  Well, they go to Plano,
