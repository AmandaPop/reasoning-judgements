A.1:  Well, what hobbies do you have?

@B.2:  Uh, I crochet.  

A.3:  #Oh, you do?#  

B.4:  #Uh, in,# in fact, uh, that's what I was doing when the phone rang.

A.5:  [Laughter].  

B.6:  [Laughter]. 

A.7:  Are you making an afghan?  

B.8:  Yeah.  I'm making a baby afghan.  

A.9:  Oh.  #How wonderful.# 

B.10:  #Uh, for my# daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number
one at age forty.

A.11:  Oh, my goodness.  

B.12:  [Laughter] I feel, I feel like she needs a goodie [laughter].

A.13:  Well, I have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age forty and I think again
at forty-three.

B.14:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.15:  #So# she's, but I'm expecting too so [laughter]. 

B.16:  Oh, my.  

A.17:  On my first.  

B.18:  Yeah.  

A.19:  But, um, I don't, uh, the only thing I really have done in the past is, um,
uh, cross stitch and needlepoint.

B.20:  Uh-huh.  

A.21:  Um, I had learned to crochet some things.  You know, those little kitchen
towels.

B.22:  Uh-huh.  

A.23:  Where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can, I
mean crochet the top part of it,

B.24:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.25:  #so that# you can attach it to an oven.  I've done that kind of stuff but
I,

B.26:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.27:  #haven't# done anything as big as an afghan.  

B.28:  Yeah.  

A.29:  Do you do that often?  

B.30:  No.  I, I really don't.  Uh, in fact, this is the first thing I've
crocheted in, in, uh, some time.

A.31:  Uh-huh.  

B.32:  But, uh, my grandmother taught me to crochet when I was five years old.

A.33:  #Huh.# 

B.34:  #Which is# a long, long, long time ago.  So but I, I don't knit.  My,
something goes wrong with my knitting.  The, the gauge doesn't work
[laughter].

A.35:  Uh-huh [lipsmack] Yeah, that's, uh, I just haven't been, oh, I think I
learned how to do that when I was real young,

B.36:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.37:  #too.# Uh, one thing I'd kind of like to learn how to do is, um, quilt.
Uh, I see so many beautiful quilts and I have friends that, that make them
but, you know, there's just, seems like there's not that amount of time
nowadays.

B.38:  Huh, I know.  I know.

A.39:  Because I work full-time outside the home.  

B.40:  Yeah.  

A.41:  Right now, anyway.  

B.42:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

A.43:  [Laughter] ((I hope)) that will change after the baby gets here but --

B.44:  Yeah.  

A.45:  -- and then you don't have the time because you're,

B.46:  Uh-huh.

A.47:  [Laughter] tending to the child.  But, uh, it would be fun to learn how to
do a few of those things.

B.48:  Yeah.  Well I'll tell you how I sort of feel about it.  I, I feel like, uh,
course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity.

A.49:  Right.  

B.50:  But it, it, I feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do
not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else
is doing it.  Uh, d-, the, if it's not real recreation, it's, it's not doing
you any good.

A.51:  Yeah.  I think that's true, um, like some people make, uh, uh, decorating
their house a hobby.

B.52:  Uh-huh.  

A.53:  And I have a friend who she and I both got into our houses around the same
time and she's real, she has a knack for that.

B.54:  Uh-huh.  

A.55:  You know, she made her own curtains and, and I would love to be able to do
all of that.

B.56:  Uh-huh.  

A.57:  But I don't feel that I have quite the knack that she does.  

B.58:  Uh-huh.  

A.59:  And so, you know, we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and I,
sometimes feel like, you know, that's a cop out but, yet,

B.60:  [Cough]. 

A.61:  it's, if I, I don't want to spend all the time and money and not, and then
feel like it looks real cheaply done or, or --

B.62:  Uh-huh.  

A.63:  -- you know, not be satisfied with it.  

B.64:  Uh-huh.  

A.65:  But, uh, my mother had that same knack, you know, 

B.66:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.# 

A.67:  #for decorating# and, and it probably just comes with, with age and with
years of e-,

B.68:  No, no, it doesn't.  You either do it, or, or, you either like it or you
don't.  You either have a knack for it or you don't.

A.69:  Huh.  

B.70:  Uh, and, and, and, uh, again, I feel like that if there's something else
that you'd rather do --

A.71:  Uh-huh.  

B.72:  -- uh, some people have a natural green thumb.  

A.73:  Uh-huh.  

B.74:  Uh, and, uh, if that's what you like to do, fine.  But if you don't, then,
uh, get a second job and hire somebody [laughter].

A.75:  Yeah [laughter]. 

B.76:  Do something that you like to do.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.  

B.78:  Uh, life is too short.  Uh, I enjoy crocheting.  It, it's real rec-,
recreation for me but, uh, and, and I used to sew a lot but and I just don't
have the time anymore.  I just now barely keep up with my mending.

A.79:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.80:  But, uh, you know, uh, if you don't like to sew, buy it ready-made.

A.81:  #Yeah.# 

B.82:  #Everything# is available anymore.  

A.83:  Yeah, 

B.84:  #And, uh,# 

A.85:  #isn't# that true?  [laughter].

B.86:  [Laughter]. 

A.87:  We, uh, in fact, mending it-, yo-, even kind of has gone by the wayside for
s-, most, for many people if they get a hole in their sarc-, sock.  They don't
darn it,

B.88:  #Huh-uh.# 

A.89:  #they,# 

B.90:  #Dump it.#

A.91:  #they, uh,# 

B.92:  Yeah.  

A.93:  [Lipsmack] uh, throw it away and buy a new pair [laughter].

B.94:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  

A.95:  But, um, yeah, there's a lot of things that I think that I'd like to do,
but I don't make the time to do them,

B.96:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.97:  #you know,# and I keep thinking, oh, well, when this happens then I'll have
more time to do it.

B.98:  #Uh-huh.#

A.99:  #And,# uh, because I like committing a, a great amount of time to something
if I'm working on it.
