A.1:  I have trouble, uh, coming up with things that actually I've considered
invasion of privacy and perhaps it's because I've become so accustomed to the
fact that that's the way technology works.

B.2:  Life is, yeah.  Well, you know, there's something that, um, I really find
kind of, maybe it's not an invasion of privacy, but it's kind of annoying.

A.3:  What's that?

B.4:  Um, you know, phone calls, uh, automated --

A.5:  Oh, gosh, yes.

B.6:  -- you know --

A.7:  Yes.

B.8:  -- I mean, I, I find that really offencing #or offensive.#

A.9:  #I suppose that it's an# invasion in that they know where you are and, 
and,

B.10:  Yeah, and they don't stop, I mean, they, you know, you call, and, [barking]
it could be any time of the day --

A.11:  Uh-huh.

B.12:  -- and what happens is, is they'll call, especially those computer ones --

A.13:  Uh-huh.

B.14:  -- they'll call, and, and they don't, you can't get them off the line.
You'll hang up, and you pick it up a minute later, and they'll still be on
there.

A.15:  Oh, seriously?  

B.16:  Yes.

A.17:  I've never had that experience.

B.18:  I just had, you know, that just happened a couple day of, I guess it's kind
of fresh in my mind because this happened a couple of days ago.

A.19:  #That's new and unusual.#

B.20:  #I picked up the phone, and it's,# you know, they started talking, giving
me all this spiel, and then, you know, you try to hang up, because there's,
there's nobody to talk to, there's only just a,

A.21:  [Laughter].

B.22:  You hang up and then you pick up to make a phone, they're still on there.

A.23:  You know, that almost seems dangerous, because what if you picked up the
phone to call nine #one one or something, and you,#

B.24:  #I know, I know, that is.#

A.25:  I wonder if that was a problem in their system.  

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  That doesn't seem like it should work that way [laughter].  

B.28:  But.

A.29:  Haunting you.

B.30:  As far as, pri-, uh, invasion of privacy, I, there really, you know, I
guess I'm kind of like you, I don't really find things a whole lot that I feel
like it's a invasion of privacy.  Um.

A.31:  I used to be concerned that everyone, no matter what the creditor always
wanted to know, your social security number --

B.32:  Oh, I know.

A.33:  -- but then I figured, well, they're, they all have to link it back to some
number that --

B.34:  Yeah.

A.35:  -- only you have, and so, everyone in the world that I have [laughter]
dealt with on a commercial basis probably has that number --

B.36:  Yeah.

A.37:  -- and that's just the way it is.

B.38:  Well, #I guess, you know, there's# --

A.39:  #They have access to all your records.#

B.40:  -- um, I, I guess I don't think about that very often, because it, it has
become the norm --

A.41:  Uh-huh.

B.42:  -- you know --

A.43:  Uh-huh.

B.44:  -- um.

A.45:  If you want to use credit, you have to pay the price and that's.

B.46:  Yeah, and you, they find ever-, I mean, they find out everything about you.
They want to know your [laughter], you know, where you live, what --

A.47:  Uh-huh.

B.48:  -- you do, what, you know #and some of the questions, yeah, and some of
the,#

A.49:  #That's probably why you have gotten# those calls, because they know that
you're one of those people who, um, are in a, I don't know, income bracket or
something --

B.50:  Uh-huh.

A.51:  -- but who has disposable income [laughter].

B.52:  Yes.  #You know, sometimes# --

A.53:  #That's why they're after you.#

B.54:  -- it does happen, you know, sometimes they would, you know, somebody would
call on the phone and, and, uh, you know, you think it's just regular type
questions, but really they are kind of prying into your, your life, #you
know.#

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  You, they want to know, uh, where you live, how long you been living there.

A.57:  Do you own, do you rent [laughter].

B.58:  Do you own, do you rent, you know, what time of the days they're usually
home, what, uh, you know, and sometimes, you know, you just kind of go through
the routine of giving it out, and then you think about it afterwards --

A.59:  Uh-huh.

B.60:  -- why did they need all that --

A.61:  Yeah, #I generally don't [laughter].#

B.62:  -- #they don't [laughter].#

A.63:  You know, when you buy a new product how the, um, warranty card always asks
your level of income --

B.64:  Yes.

A.65:  -- and it usually says optional so --

B.66:  Uh-huh.

A.67:  -- I rarely fill it, I don't think I ever fill it out frankly.

B.68:  Right.

A.69:  But, uh, they, they want to know, they [laughter] would like to come back
and --

B.70:  Oh, yeah, #oh, yeah.#

A.71:  -- #see whether or not# you're going to buy another product.

B.72:  Yep.

A.73:  Interesting.

B.74:  But, uh.

A.75:  That's how marketing works today, I think.

B.76:  I guess it is.  I'm, I'm in that area so it's, uh.

A.77:  Are you?  [Laughter].

B.78:  Well, I'm, yeah, I'm in sales, so I --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- you always kind of, uh, you know, I know that when we, when I sell a
product to a new customer, that's always the first thing that I ask, you know,
is about their credit and, you know, would they have to fill out a little --

A.81:  Uh-huh, uh-huh.

B.82:  -- credit application with, with us.  And sometimes I feel very
uncomfortable in, in doing that.

A.83:  Really.

B.84:  Uh --

A.85:  Huh.

B.86:  -- you know, but I know that in order for our company to survive we can't,
you know, uh --

A.87:  Oh, yeah, you don't want to take risks.

B.88:  -- don't want to take the risks.

A.89:  Uh-huh.

B.90:  So, um, I suppose some of those, uh.

A.91:  Do you personally look at those credit, uh, references #or does someone
else do that?#

B.92:  #You know, this, that's the funniest# thing, is be, rare, I mean, maybe one
out of ten do #we check on it.#

A.93:  #Someone else# in your company #does that.#

B.94:  #Yeah,# you know, but it's kind of a routine type thing where you --

A.95:  Uh-huh.

B.96:  -- just do it, and, and you file it away, and, uh, you know, at random --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- we'll, we'll go ahead and check on it, but, um, it's not.

A.99:  Oh, really.  So there isn't someone who every time does it, just not you.

B.100:  No, huh-uh.

A.101:  Um.

B.102:  So, you know, I just gather the information and, and somebody else, uh, you
know, at their leisure time, uh, will check on those credit references.

A.103:  But most of them are checked on routinely, just by someone else.

B.104:  Yeah, most of them are, #yeah# --

A.105:  #Uh-huh.#

B.106:  -- most of them are, but they're not all, you know, they're not all, you
know, they're not all done at the same time.

A.107:  Uh-huh, that makes sense.

B.108:  And, uh, you know, I, I wonder about credit, uh,
