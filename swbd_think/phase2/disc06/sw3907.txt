A.1:  Alright.

B.2:  Okay.

@A.3:  Okay.  Uh, so what kind of, uh, uh, piece of property have you got?

B.4:  We've got a home and, uh, a very large front and back yard.  We have a lot
of Dallas grass.  What they call Da-, Dallas grass and other parts of the
country call Crab grass.  That real thick grass.

A.5:  Uh-huh.

B.6:  And we had a problem with that, but we seem to have taken care of it.  How
about you?

A.7:  Well, uh, I, uh, [noise] up here we don't have too much trouble with Crab
grass or anything like that.  Uh, uh, we've, uh, we rent the house that we live
in, but we got a pretty [noise] large piece of, uh, land that we live on --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- even though it's very close in to Washington, D C.  And so most of the
work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and, uh, uh, uh, my sweetheart
that I live with does a lot of flower gardening [noise] and stuff around the
house.  She gets a lot of pleasure from that.

B.10:  Which flowers does she like?

A.11:  Uh, well it changes from year to year and she is thinking this year she is
going to get into bulbs and that sort of thing, but most of the sorts of
things that she has grown in the past have been, uh, I guess wild flowers and,
uh, some stuff that our neighbors sort of brings over periodically.  She has
also, she likes things like Hollyhocks and Peonies and, uh, oh, what else has
she got?  Oh, the other things that she is really into is Morning Glories and
uh, in the summer time we have Morning Glories just all over the house.  #It's
great# --

B.12:  #Uh-huh.#

A.13:  -- all different colors.

B.14:  Yeah, they climb too.

A.15:  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  It's real pleasant.  In fact our next door
neighbor when Christmas time is here, couldn't resist giving us a, uh, set of
coffee cups [laughter] that had Morning Glories all over them.

B.16:  [Laughter].

A.17:  And, uh, she, she found them and said Oh, I just had to buy them for you.
But we are also really into vegetable gardening.

B.18:  Do you have a problem with any type of insects or #gophers# --

A.19:  #Actually# --

B.20:  -- or anything.

A.21:  -- yeah, actually we do.  We don't have any, uh, any, uh, you know varmints
or anything like that, that [noise] tend to bother the garden, but we do have
a lot of trouble with insects, particularly caterpillars.  Uh, we have had
very, very poor luck with, uh, all of the core crops and like, uh, uh, cabbage
and, and uh, broccoli and --

B.22:  If you, uh --

A.23:  -- cauliflower and that sort of thing.

B.24:  -- sprinkle lime on your young plants before they get too big.

A.25:  Uh-huh.

B.26:  That should help that.

A.27:  Well that's, uh, exactly what we have done and you're advice is, is dead on
in our experiences.  In fact, we have what works even better than lime is
dialtamatious earth.  Uh,

B.28:  Yeah, that works.  That's kind of hard to get hold of sometimes.

A.29:  Yeah.  Well, uh, Jackie got hold of a huge box of it.  So much of it that I
dare say that we'll probably still using, still be using,

B.30:  [Laughter].

A.31:  it five years from now [laughter].  She went out to some, uh, pool supply
place and got this huge box of it and it's really big and she came home with
it and she was real proud and she said, okay, well we've got a life time
supply now.

B.32:  [Laughter].

A.33:  So we've got no excuse.  And, uh [noise],

B.34:  What vegetable do you grow the most?

A.35:  Well we, uh, have, uh, I guess in the last two or three years, we have
discovered that we're fond of hot peppers and so, uh, we grow tomatoes down one
side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden
plot this past, uh, couple of years, we've grown a lot of different varieties
of hot peppers.

B.36:  Do you have Jalapenos?

A.37:  Yes, which, of course, are our favorites and, uh, [noise] but we have also
grown a lot of real, uh, uh, hot, uh, smaller varieties, like Tys --

B.38:  Uh-huh.

A.39:  -- and, uh,

B.40:  Do you have the small red ones, Cayenne?

A.41:  Yeah, yeah.  The Cayenne and we have even grown some little funny, uh, uh,
peppers, and I have never been sure.  One of them, I believe is called Chili
Tepid and the other one is called Pequine and, uh, they're, they're little
tiny hot things that we, she takes them inside and she dries them and then we
eat and nibble on for weeks [static].

B.42:  I have heard of the Chili, but I have never heard of the Pequine.  What are
they?  Are they green, red, and yellow, what?

A.43:  They are little green, literally pea size peppers.  They're just little
tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're, they're,
you know, fresh food --

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  -- on the, uh, on the plant, but the plants are just incredibly prodigious.
They just produce zillions of them.  #Uh,# 

B.46:  #What# do you use them for mainly?

A.47:  Uh, all kinds of dishes.  Like I say we, 

B.48:  [Sniffing].

A.49:  grind them up and, uh, we freeze some of them and then use them in stews
and, uh, whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that, we tend to, uh, to
put some on it.  It's just incredible but, uh, the number of ways that we come
up to use them and, uh, it's, it's funny.  I mean we were laughing at our
selves one night because we, uh, we realized that, uh, we had, uh, [laughter]
we were having it with every meal.

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  But anyway, it's, uh, it's something that we enjoy immensely and it, we get
a lot of pleasure out of it.  I love tilling up the garden every year and, uh,
you know, getting out there and spending some,
