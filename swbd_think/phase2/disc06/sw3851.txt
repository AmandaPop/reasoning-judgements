===========================================================================

A.1:  Go ahead (( )).

@B.2:  Well, I, as I say, I work for a telecommunications company in Plano --

A.3:  Uh-huh.

B.4:  -- and, uh, I really can't complain about the benefits, I think they're,
they're pretty up-to-date and pretty comprehensive.  Uh.

A.5:  Do you have profit sharing?

B.6:  Uh, yes, they have a thrift plan, profit sharing, and, uh, the routine
things, the medical coverage and dental and, uh, hearing coverage and so
forth.

A.7:  Right.

B.8:  Stock purchase plan and that sort of thing.

A.9:  Well, that's nice.

B.10:  Yeah, it's, uh, they're pretty good, uh, pretty good program, pretty good
benefits [throat_clearing] and, uh, there's a, uh, in the thrift plan you can
make a choice of program that you can have your contributions directed to,
it's not just for the purchase of the company's stock.  They have three or
four different options available for you.  So, it's, uh, #and the vacation.#

A.11:  #Yeah, my# company has that, too.

B.12:  What kind of, what industry you in?

A.13:  Uh, medical.

B.14:  #Oh, I see.#

A.15:  #I work for# a private laboratory.

B.16:  Oh, okay.  

A.17:  Yeah, we were smaller, and it, it was, it was a lot better, the benefits
were a lot better, and then we bought out another lab, and --

B.18:  Um.

A.19:  -- uh, they kind of cut the benefits a little bit.

B.20:  Yeah, there's a lot of that going on because of the economy, and --

A.21:  Right.

B.22:  -- so forth.  The medical programs have been cut back, and --

A.23:  Right.

B.24:  -- we've had to, I guess up to a year ago, the coverage for the employee,
medical coverage was free, but they charge, I think, five dollars a month now,
and they, they've --

A.25:  Well, that's not bad.

B.26:  -- no, it's, you can't complain about that.  And they've raised deductible,
or lowered --

A.27:  How?

B.28:  -- lowered the deductible.

A.29:  Oh really, lowered it to what?

B.30:  Wait a minute now, they raised the deductible --

A.31:  Yeah [laughter].

B.32:  -- they raised the deductible and,

A.33:  To, what's your deductible?

B.34:  I think it's, uh, two hundred per person, five hundred for, for the family,
two hundred per #covered.#

A.35:  #That's, that's# good.

B.36:  Uh, it's, it's been better, but they have, as I said, they've raised it
here in the last year or two, but again, I can't, I really can't complain
about that.  The vacation plan is pretty good, and, uh, there are eleven
holidays a year.  It's, it's again, it's a competitive program, pretty
standard.

A.37:  Right, that's, that's, that's better than most, though.  I,

B.38:  Yeah.  Well, as I said, and as you know, they're, they're cutting back in a
lot of areas, and, uh --

A.39:  Right.

B.40:  -- not just laying off, but, uh, cutting salaries and cutting back in the
benefits area as well.  So.

A.41:  Well, that can help a company a lot, you know --

B.42:  Yeah.

A.43:  -- if they, if they're in the, in the past have been giving a lot of
benefits, if they cut them just a little bit, that'll help.

B.44:  Uh-huh.

A.45:  And then I think some employees will tolerate that instead of lowering
their salaries.

B.46:  Oh, yeah, that's for sure --

A.47:  Yeah, I would.

B.48:  -- or being laid off.

A.49:  Yeah, I know, they, uh, they raised our deductible from two hundred to four
hundred --

B.50:  Um, per --

A.51:  -- a person.

B.52:  -- for, for the employee?

A.53:  Uh-huh.

B.54:  Yeah, that's pretty steep.

A.55:  Yeah, it is, but that's something I can live with, you know, if that's, if
that's what they want to stop at.

B.56:  They have a flexible spending account up here where you can contribute a
certain amount every month to this flexible spending pl-, spending plan, and
use that money to, uh, pay your medical, uh, costs out of --

A.57:  Uh-huh.

B.58:  -- and there's, there's a lot of interest in that.  Of course if you put in
too much money, you have to have a pretty good idea as to what your medical
expenses are going to be for the year --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- because if you put in too much, and you, you don't use it all, you don't
get it back --

A.61:  Oh, wow.

B.62:  -- you lose it.  But, uh, there's quite a bit of interest in that.  We have
an H M O as well as the, uh, standard group --

A.63:  Right.

B.64:  -- program.  Do you have an H M O down at your place?

A.65:  No, huh-uh, we sure don't.

B.66:  Yeah.  I don't there's as much interest in that up here, in the H M O as
the regular.

A.67:  Well, they're, they're pretty big around here, too.  

B.68:  Yeah.

A.69:  And, you know, the larger companies have the H M O -s --

B.70:  Right.

A.71:  -- whereas the smaller companies don't. 

B.72:  [Throat_clearing].

A.73:  I know, our, our company underwrites our own insurance.

B.74:  Oh, okay.

A.75:  Which, in a way, I think it, it could be a little bad, but --

B.76:  Uh-huh.

A.77:  -- so far it's working out okay.

B.78:  Yeah.  #Well.#

A.79:  #What H,# H M O are you at?

B.80:  Oh, it's, uh, it's Cigna, I think.  We, uh --

A.81:  Uh-huh.

B.82:  -- Cigna is the, uh, one that they're using.  And we have Aetna.  Aetna
underwrites, not underwrites, but it, Aetna administers our medical program.

A.83:  Uh-huh.

B.84:  We're self-insured, but Aetna is used to administer the program, but Cigna,
Cigna is the, uh, H M O they use.

A.85:  Oh, that's not bad.

B.86:  No, it's, it's pretty good, it's pretty good coverage.

A.87:  And you have a retirement program and all that?

B.88:  A what?

A.89:  A retirement program --

B.90:  Oh.

A.91:  -- and all that?

B.92:  Well, it's, uh, no, they don't, they really, they don't ha-, that's one
thing they don't ha-, I guess I could say they really do need to, uh, uh, get
or acquire.  They, they think that the four O one K could be used as a, as a
retirement plan.  I guess that's what some people are doing.

A.93:  Right.

B.94:  But there's no retirement plan at all.

A.95:  Yeah, I've heard of the four O one K used as a retirement program before.

B.96:  In fact they're using a company down there in Austin, Four O One K
management company --

A.97:  Uh-huh.

B.98:  -- to administer the pro-, it switched to them over the, well, last 
month --

A.99:  Uh-huh.

B.100:  -- but they made a nice presentation, so the company decided to go with
them.  But that's one thing they could use as a retirement plan.  Unless you
do, unless you are committed to using your Four O One K as a retirement
program --

A.101:  Right.

B.102:  -- but they don't have any kind of retirement plan.

A.103:  Can you contribute to that Four O One K?

B.104:  Oh, yes, yeah, and they do too.  They match it up to a certain percent.
You can contribute up to fifteen percent, depending on your salary --

A.105:  Uh-huh.

B.106:  -- and then, uh,
