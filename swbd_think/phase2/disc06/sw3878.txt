A.1:  There,

B.2:  It's beautiful.  It's wonderful.  I love it, it's not January [laughter].

A.3:  [Laughter]  It is sunny today?

B.4:  It's sunny.  There's a few light wispy little clouds floating around.
There's a light breeze.  It's about sixty-three degrees.

A.5:  Oh, nice.

B.6:  It's wonderful.  My --

A.7:  Yeah.

B.8:  -- son and I have been out for a couple of walks today.

A.9:  Really.

B.10:  Yeah.

A.11:  Yeah.  It's real nice.  Has it been raining?

B.12:  Uh, it stopped raining, let's see, Mon-, Monday or Tuesday.

A.13:  #Oh.#

B.14:  #Monday.#  It stopped raining.  It has been raining --

A.15:  Yeah.  

B.16:  -- until then.

A.17:  It's, it was raining until yesterday, here.

B.18:  Was it?

A.19:  Yeah.

B.20:  And it's, but it has been real icky.  Well no, it rained Monday night.  It
rained, it stopped raining Monday night like #Tuesday# --

A.21:  #Yeah.#

B.22:  -- it was clear, but it's been really nasty.  The clouds have been over
cast even though it's been kind of warm.  So that it is muggy and that wasn't
very good either.

A.23:  Did you get some snow and all that?

B.24:  Uh, we did.  We got snow about a week and a half ago --

A.25:  That's what I thought.

B.26:  -- and it was, it was really wild because, uh, the snow was, uh, it didn't
stick.

A.27:  Oh.

B.28:  But, it flurried and you could see it but it, uh, it didn't stick any.

A.29:  Huh.

B.30:  Yeah.  It was nice.  It turned into, it was like rain, it, because it was
warm even.

A.31:  Yeah.

B.32:  It was above freezing.

A.33:  Wow.

B.34:  But it was between, uh, just where the clouds were and where you know --

A.35:  Uh-huh.

B.36:  -- but when the snow got down here it was cold enough to freeze it and then
it just stayed frozen.  It was, uh, wet snow.  I guess is what they call it.

A.37:  Yeah.

B.38:  When is starts thawing before it hits the ground.

A.39:  We haven't had anything like that.

B.40:  Really.

A.41:  Yeah, it's only, uh, it's only froze, we have only had two freezes so far
this winter, but I think it is going to be a lot warmer soon.

B.42:  Oh, yeah.  Well, I am wondering about the summer.  What is summer going to
be like if winter is this temperate.

A.43:  Right.

B.44:  We are bound to have a real doozy of a summer.

A.45:  That's what I think, #because# --

B.46:  #But,#

A.47:  -- but with all this rain, all the, all the flowers ought to be real
pretty.

B.48:  I don't know, I've, I've had, uh, I have Easter Lilies that I grow in my
back yard --

A.49:  Uh-huh.

B.50:  -- and they have already started up.

A.51:  Wow.

B.52:  And it's way too early.

A.53:  Yes it is.

B.54:  For Easter Lilies.  They shouldn't be up until March when the flowers
actually start to bloom.

A.55:  Yeah, I have seen Day Lilies, uh, not Day Lilies, Daffodils around town.
Uh --

B.56:  Already coming?

A.57:  -- and blooming.

B.58:  In bloom?

A.59:  And blooming.

B.60:  Oh please.

A.61:  Yeah [laughter].

B.62:  Uh, I, I put down Coccus this year, thinking oh, well it will get cold in
January and,

A.63:  [Laughter].

B.64:  February, you know, and I won't have to worry about it but,

A.65:  [Laughter].

B.66:  I don't think I am going to get Coccus this year.

A.67:  You might not.  You might not.

B.68:  No, I don't think it got cold enough for them to come out.

A.69:  But do you have the wild flowers up there?

B.70:  We don't have as many wild flowers here as there are down toward Austin.  I
use to go to school in San Marcus, so I am familiar with Austin --

A.71:  Yeah.

B.72:  --  and the area.

A.73:  They ought to be really pretty this year.

B.74:  I think so.  I think the highways are going to be great.

A.75:  Yeah.

B.76:  I am ready to travel.

A.77:  Yeah, we like to go out and take pictures of them and everything --

B.78:  Oh.

A.79:  -- it, they ought to be really, off of two ninety especially is real nice.

B.80:  Uh-huh.  I agree.

A.81:  Yeah, my husband said with all the rain this year --

B.82:  Uh-huh.

A.83:   -- that it ought to be real real nice.

B.84:  I agree and it's, it'll probably be wonderful out there.

A.85:  Well, this kind of weather today, I feel like getting outside [laughter].

B.86:  Well, I'm wishing, I'm, I'm wishing I had made a picnic for my son and I,
put down a blanket or a sleeping bag and had a picnic outside.

A.87:  Yeah, that would have been nice.

B.88:  Yeah, that, that's what will be great when all the wild flowers come out.

A.89:  Right.

B.90:  Take yourself on a picnic and,

A.91:  Well, the weather man said it's suppose to start raining again for us
tomorrow.

B.92:  Oh, really.

A.93:  And through the weekend.

B.94:  We're not suppose to get it until about Monday, Sunday night or Monday.

A.95:  Oh, maybe, it will, might, we might not get it here. #But, well# --

B.96:  #Well we've, uh.# 

A.97:  -- they told us it was going to rain today too.  We don't have the most
reliable weather men [laughter].

B.98:  Oh.  I guess not [laughter].

A.99:  No, they told us it was going to rain today [laughter].

B.100:  Oh, although they revise, they revise our weather report about every other
day.  It changes --

A.101:  Yeah.

B.102:  -- it seems like, but they have been saying it was going to rain Saturday
afternoon, but now we are under a big high.

A.103:  Yeah.

B.104:  Or high pressure.

A.105:  Yeah.

B.106:  So we're, uh, we are going to be stable for a while.  They say through
Sunday.

A.107:  Oh, good.

B.108:  Yeah.  That would be,

A.109:  Maybe we might get some of that.  It seems like there's a line there at
Waco where it will come to Waco and then go.

B.110:  Uh-huh.

A.111:  And we won't get it.

B.112:  Yeah.

A.113:  Or, it will go up as far as Waco and then move over and Dallas won't get
it.

B.114:  Uh-huh.

A.115:  You know, but, uh, I hope it will be pretty this weekend.  I, I can't wait
cause it's rained oh I know for the last four or five weekends here.  It's
just been miserable.

B.116:  Uh-huh.

A.117:  And I want to get outside and barbecue.

B.118:  Uh-huh.

A.119:  That will be fun.

B.120:  Exactly.

A.121:  But, uh, yeah I can't wait.
