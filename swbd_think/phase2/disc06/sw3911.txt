A.1:  Um,

@B.2:  So you have a son?

A.3:  I have an older son, yeah.  He doesn't have any children yet though.

B.4:  Uh-huh.

A.5:  Uh, he's thirty-seven and I don't know if he's ever going to have any or
not, but I do have some neighbor kids, lots of little neighbor kids.

B.6:  Uh-huh.

A.7:  That, I go out and, uh, I play ball with them.  You know, it's, because
like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home --

B.8:  Uh-huh.

A.9:  -- on computers --

B.10:  Uh-huh.

A.11:  -- and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her.  Which is kind
of sad, you know.

B.12:  Yeah.

A.13:  So the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them.  So I will go
out and play catch with them or you know, we ha-, let the dogs outside and
they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs but, uh, actually I
do think that the parents should have, you know, a little bit more time to
spend with their kids.

B.14:  I would think so.  When you, when, when your son was at home did you, uh,
working?  Did you work or were you able to stay at home with him?

A.15:  No, when my son was at home, I, I did work and then he went to a baby
sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat, you know --

B.16:  Uh-huh.

A.17:  -- but we always had our days off together and we went camping on
vacations.  So we had a lot of time together that way you know.

B.18:  Yeah.  Well when my mom, uh, when I was growing up my mom worked too, but
she worked nights --

A.19:  Uh-huh.

B.20:  -- and, uh, as a nurse and so she was always home for us --

A.21:  Uh-huh.

B.22:  -- and I always, I really appreciated that.  Having her there when I was,
you know, when I came home from school and when I worked, but now when I look
back at it, it must have been a really difficult [laughter] thing that she did
--

A.23:  Yeah.

B.24:  -- for us.

A.25:  Oh yeah.  Well I am sure it was, you know.  But, uh, I don't know what the
families are going to come to now days because they, there just doesn't seem
like they do have time for their kids.  Because most, most of them, the father
and mother both work, you know.

B.26:  Yeah.

A.27:  So, it's really rough.  Uh, I have one neighbor that's, uh, the father is a
fireman and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come
home for like three or four days, but he can't make enough as a fireman to
support his family, you know.  So, he's got a second job.

B.28:  Um.

A.29:  So he's, you know he's not home very often.

B.30:  Yeah.

A.31:  And that's, you know, the kids I know miss that.

B.32:  They #really do.#

A.33:  #You know.#

B.34:  Uh, a family without a father, it's, it's, uh a really hard thing.

A.35:  Yeah, you know and I don't know, I, I suppose they are trying to get
through to them that well daddy is not home because, you know, he is out
working trying to make some money for, you know, we can buy you this bike and
that toy and so forth, you know.

B.36:  Uh-huh.

A.37:  But, uh,  

B.38:  Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.

A.39:  [Throat_clearing] Oh, I am sure they would you know.  So, are you planning
on, to having any children or,

B.40:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.

A.41:  #Uh-huh.#

B.42:  #Uh-huh.# But we are, we just got married like, like December, so we are
going to wait a year.

A.43:  Um. Yeah.

B.44:  #And,#

A.45:  #Well# that's good.

B.46:  Then we will try.

A.47:  That's what my uh, daughter-in-law told me.  That they were going to have
kids probably after two years of marriage.

B.48:  Uh-huh.

A.49:  And they will be married nine years [laughter],

B.50:  [Laughter].

A.51:  this year.  [laughter] So, I don't know.  She's a nurse, you know and, uh,
she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids, so maybe they
just decided that, uh, if they wanted to have kids around the house they would
just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send
the kids over for the night.

B.52:  Yeah, that's a possibility.

A.53:  You know.  #But, uh,#

B.54:  #Well, We# really want to have a family.  We feel like that, that couple
you know, you are not giving enough of yourself #and# --

A.55:  #Uh-huh.#

B.56:  -- you should, you should be sharing your family.

A.57:  Uh-huh, so,

B.58:  And giving your values, you know, making something better of the world by
raising up good kids [clicking] --

A.59:  Right.

B.60:  -- and letting them know they're loved and stuff.

A.61:  Right. #Right.#

B.62:  #Give them, give them an edge,# but, we feel like, like the first year
needs to be devoted to, uh, making the family, the couple strong --

A.63:  Uh-huh.

B.64:  -- and secure in their love for each other.

A.65:  Right. #Right.#

B.66:  #But then,# a family is, is definitely a high priority.

A.67:  Yeah, uh, do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do
you, do you work or what?

B.68:  Well, well I, uh, I am in, I am in a different situation.  I am a
missionary --

A.69:  Uh-huh.

B.70:  -- and I am home on furlough.  It called, like I have worked for four years
in Africa and I come home for a year.

A.71:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.72:  And then we go back for four years.  But my husband and I will do the same
job and we will be living in, in Africa and we will be working together.

A.73:  Uh-huh.

B.74:  So, uh, we will, we will share the job of raising the family.  I mean as a
mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have
but, still we will share that job.

A.75:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

B.76:  But we have, then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard
about schooling, like do you want to home school your kids on a computer
program --

A.77:  Uh-huh.

B.78:  -- you know, that kind of thing --

A.79:  Uh-huh.

B.80:  -- or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do
that when do you do it and that's a,
