============================================================================

A.1:  ((Go)). 

B.2:  Good.  

@A.3:  Now what kinds of things do you like to listen to?

B.4:  Well my, uh, uh, my interests lie mainly in classical music. 

A.5:  Is that right?  #Uh-huh.# 

B.6:  #And, uh,# uh, I, although I wasn't raised with opera it's something that
I've, I come to enjoy.  How about yourself?

A.7:  Well, actually I kind of like the same things myself and, um, [lipsmack]
uh, I did, uh, study some music in school although I'm not, uh, a musician.  I
just took it kind of as an advocation and I sing with the Brookhaven singers
over at Brookhaven College.  You must be familiar with that name,

B.8:  #Right.# 

A.9:  #living# in Dallas.  

B.10:  Absolutely.  

A.11:  And, uh, they have, um, [lipsmack] a lovely woman over there who, uh,
[lipsmack] teaches singing and, um, has a Saturday class as well as private
lessons and, uh, we go and we sing for some retirement homes and at the
Botanical Gardens and things like that.  And, uh, it's really very, very, very
enjoyable [lipsmack] and I do try to get down to the symphonies at least a
couple of times a year, and I didn't get down to the opera this year though
but I have in the past.  Um, [lipsmack] but anyway I do enjoy listening to
especially the classical music that has some kind of a story line or a theme
like Beethoven (( )) and things like that where you can --

B.12:  Sure.  

A.13:  -- follow, um, [lipsmack] ((through)) some of the mood of the, of the
melodies and not just have, um, [lipsmack] you know, a kind of,

B.14:  #Sound.# 

A.15:  #mathematical# arrangement of the notes which is also fascinating many
times, but I like that break of a kind of a story line sometimes.  What kind
of, uh, pieces are your favorites?

B.16:  Well I, uh, I tend to shy away from someone who, uh, uh, is born later than
nineteen hundred.

A.17:  Uh-huh.  

B.18:  Other than ((Erin Copeland)).  

A.19:  Oh, yeah.  

B.20:  #Uh, Erin Copeland,#

A.21:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.22:  I enjoy.  

A.23:  Uh-huh.  What about Gershwin? 

B.24:  Oh, G-, uh, Gershwin is, uh, I, I, uh, I, I haven't, uh, quite found jazz
to be enjoyable and, and,

A.25:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.26:  #and a# lot of Gershwin has a, a, some of, some of his work is a little,
uh, h-, has enough of jazz, uh --

A.27:  Uh-huh.  

B.28:  -- that, uh, that, uh, is not particularly enjoyable for me to #listen to.#

A.29:  #Uh-huh.#  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  The, uh, uh, uh, like I, I, I suspect my favorites, uh, are in the, uh,
seventeenth and eighteenth century,

A.31:  #Huh.#

B.32:  #uh,# uh, musicians.  

A.33:  Uh-huh.  

B.34:  Uh, I'd, the, uh, oh, there's one, uh, uh, I guess more recent one with,
uh, Copeland, uh, is, uh, ((Raspegie)) who I was always amazed that he was,
uh, so co-, contemporary.

A.35:  Uh-huh.  

B.36:  Um, but I, uh, uh, I, our family gets down to, uh, the ((Myerson))
relatively frequently.  It, it's our, uh, uh, our one enjoyable, uh --

A.37:  Uh-huh.

B.38:  -- if we can make it to Saturday, uh, everything is okay.  

A.39:  Uh-huh.  

B.40:  So it's, uh, it's a relatively, 

A.41:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.42:  #busy,# uh, activity we, uh, one, uh, very nice, uh, uh, opportunity that
we've had is the, is the Dallas Chamber Orchestra.

A.43:  Oh, really?  

B.44:  That has, uh, uh, actually it's, it's, it's wonderful they, they have a
Sunday matinee --

A.45:  Uh-huh.  

B.46:  -- that, uh, uh, if you buy two season tickets, the kids go free.

A.47:  Oh.  

B.48:  And, uh, that gives us an opportunity to, uh, uh, to take the, to, uh, uh,
make sure the kids, uh, get, uh, get dressed up and, and go to the symphony
whether they want to or not.

A.49:  Uh-huh.  

B.50:  And, uh, the, uh, their, they oblige us by falling asleep so at least
that's ((pretty good)).

A.51:  [Laughter]  How old are your children?  

B.52:  They're, uh, eleven, nine, and eight.  

A.53:  Oh.  

B.54:  #But just tha-,# 

A.55:  #Isn't# that wonderful, 

B.56:  #And it's,#  

A.57:  #though?#  

B.58:  it's nice in that, uh -- 

A.59:  Uh-huh.  

B.60:  -- in that t-, y-, they're, that you can get real close to the, uh, to the
chamber orchestra and see the music and watch the musicians.  It's, uh, it's a
very intimate setting --

A.61:  Uh-huh.  

B.62:  -- and the, the music is really very good.  

A.63:  I bet it is.  Now I have never heard them.  Um, that ((Myerson)) Auditorium
is really, is really quite acoustically beautiful.  I, I have to admit that.
Um, I had the privilege of going to the, uh, piano concert that, uh, (( )) who
is a young, uh,

B.64:  #Right.#  

A.65:  #Russian# artist gave I guess it was just before Christmas time and I'm
tel-, and, and it was no orchestra or anything.  It was just he.

B.66:  It was just recital.

A.67:  And, yes.  And I'm telling you the sound, the sound was so, so perfect.
Uh, I, I had heard, you know, the orchestra, the symphony and we went for the
toy symphony and the young,

B.68:  #Oh, uh-huh.# 

A.69:  #children's#, um, uh, uh, orchestra from S M U,

B.70:  #Right.# 

A.71:  #and# several things down there.  This is the first time I just heard like
one artist.

B.72:  #Right.#

A.73:  #And,#
