A.1:  Okay, I work with, uh, a lot of students and, 

B.2:  #Uh-huh.#

A.3:  #uh,# in my, uh, occupation talking to them about college and going to
colleges.  I think in advise that I give to, would give to, uh, parents I've
had four so-, five sons that have gone to, to, to, uh, college.  I think one of
the main things is that they, they choose a local college that, uh,
[lipsmack] or university that will go along with their goals as far as what
degrees they want to go into, and if they're in the local area they don't have
to pay out of state tuition and all of those things.  And, uh, [lipsmack]
then,

B.4:  Yeah, that's certainly helpful.  

A.5:  Go ahead.  

B.6:  I-, sa-, your last suggestion there about [throat_clearing] saying within
state, I realize that there are a lot of schools and unless the, uh, student
has a real specialty and there, oh, maybe are one or two universities that are
highly respected --

A.7:  Uh-huh.  

B.8:  -- in that field.  They really ought to try to stay within their state.  I
mean, financing in universities now is getting a, very, very high.

A.9:  Yes, it is.  

B.10:  And they can't help themselves on that either.  

A.11:  Uh-huh.  

B.12:  So it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state. 

A.13:  Uh, that, that's, uh, kind of th-, the advice that I give, and then, uh,
they need to take a look at the, uh, uh, the courses of study and, uh, how it
would go into their, their major and minor field.

B.14:   #Yeah [throat_clearing].#

A.15:  #Uh, what# kind of placement, uh, they have out of a particular area.  I
had one son who, uh, went to a smaller college, uh, to, uh, went out in the,
uh, premed area.

B.16:  Uh-huh.  

A.17:  But they had an excellent record of placing, uh, their students in medical
schools after they finished the program and he was,

B.18:  Well, that's very important.  

A.19:  Right.  He got early acceptance to a, to medical school after he finished
and, uh, if he would have gone to, uh, say the state, uh, it would h-, be the
University of Utah.  If he would have gone there, uh, I don't know that he
would have got accepted to medical school there or not.

B.20:  Well, that was certainly, uh, good advice to get him to go to a school who
follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their
students.

A.21:  #Uh-huh.#  

B.22:  #That,# that means that the quality of what he was taught must be, uh, uh,
very, very high.

A.23:  Yes, uh,

B.24:  And that's good for him too regardless of where he works.  He has, uh, a
top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically.

A.25:  Uh-huh.  And you, you can do this for any of the, uh, any, uh, university
or, or for any of the students that are planning, uh, take a look at th-,
their final goals.  At least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they
want to go out in.  And then, uh, if it's law school or if it's, uh, medical
or whatever, there are different, uh, colleges and universities usually within
the state that, uh, have a littl-, little better placement record or, or
getting them into --

B.26:  Uh-huh.  

A.27:  -- into those higher degree or higher areas.  

B.28:  Well, we have that same situation here.  I'm, I'm a retired professor at
Penn State.

A.29:  I see.  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  And, uh, the field I worked in was acoustics, and we have an acoustics
department here, and we have lots of students.  Several hundred I guess in, in
acoustics.  And they have an excellent opportunity to follow-through on their
fields because our university is well known for it's research --

A.31:  Uh-huh.  You bet. 

B.32:  -- in addition to, uh, teaching.  Obviously if we can do high class
research, we must be well trained and, and, uh, available to teach the
students,

A.33:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.34:  #well.#  

A.35:  And, uh, that would be a school that the parents should seek out for their
--

B.36:  Yes.  

A.37:  -- uh, students if they're interested in that, that field and, and where
it's well known, uh, the word gets out.  That, that might be a, a case where
even if it was out of state you might have to pay a little higher tuition.
Then it would be well,

B.38:  #Yes.# 

A.39:  #worth the,# the, uh, to, to go to, to Penn State.

B.40:  Yes, because Penn, Penn State is very well known in, uh, many of its, uh,
m-, of its fields and, uh, we, we get a lot, we'd, uh, we only, we get our
sort of, say, we get state, uh, students not only from out of state, but from
all over the world.

A.41:  Uh-huh.  #Yes.#

B.42:  #I# mean, they, they, they really come here.  We have a very high, a
percentage of foreign students because Penn State is pretty well tops in many
of its fields.

A.43:  Uh-huh.  You bet.  

B.44:  And we have doubled in size in the last fifteen, twenty years I guess.

A.45:  Uh-huh.  Well, that's very important in, in a choice of a college or
university that they look at those aspects,

B.46:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.47:  #uh, whatever# they might be.  And if it's, financially if they can do
that, that's, that's great.

B.48:  Yes, that's true.  

A.49:  But they need to know about the, the costs and, uh, how they're going to be
able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or whether parents
are able to help or whatever.  But, uh, [lipsmack] uh, the bottom line is,
uh, the, the college or university that's going to give them the best
training, prepare them for life.

B.50:  Yes.  And then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the,
the bottom line is to give your,
