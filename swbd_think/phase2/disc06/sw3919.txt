==========================================================================

B.1:  So, you think, uh, the Soviet Union is a threat any more to us?

A.2:  You know, I was thinking about that while I was waiting for the connection.
I, I think, uh, you know, it's, uh, a military threat.  Certainly, I don't feel
like it's, it's like it was back in the sixties when ever Kruschev said he was
going to bury us.

@B.3:  Uh-huh.

A.4:  Uh, at the same time, I, I think they may still be a threat in a different
sort of way and the, uh, the situation over there is so unstable --

B.5:  Yeah.  Yeah {very faint}.

A.6:  -- and, and the especially the economics, uh, uh, ramifications of whatever
is going to happen over there.  I mean, they're like a quarter of a land mass
of the earth.

B.7:  Uh-huh.

A.8:  You know, and if, if things don't get straightened out over there it, it
will impact us one way or the other I think.

B.9:  Right.  Right.  I think, I am just afraid of what they're going to do with
their nuclear war head that they already have right now that, uh, they said
you know that they are open to, uh, anybody that is willing to pay the money.
I think you grant that you know if you've got the money for it we will give
you the war head.

A.10:  Is that right.  #I# --

B.11:  #Yeah.#

A.12:  -- hadn't heard that.

B.13:  And, uh, I am just afraid you know some, some guy like Sadaam Hussein
[laughter].

A.14:  Yeah or or any one of the other, uh --

B.15:  Oh yeah.

A.16:  -- nuts that are running around.  Yeah.

B.17:  [Throat_clearing] You could get someone like you know Kurisha, the guy who
uh, who negotiates the arms, you know.

A.18:  Uh-huh.

B.19:  You know, he buys them out.  Sticks them in his arsenal.  Starts selling
them to everybody in the world [laughter].

A.20:  Yeah.

B.21:  [Laughter].

A.22:  Well it's, uh, I don't know.  It's amazing to see, uh, the kind of changes
that's happened --

B.23:  Uh-huh.

A.24:  -- just in the past, uh, you know, not even ten years or even five years --

B.25:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.26:  -- it's just awesome.

B.27:  Well you know, it's I guess the break up it's self was, was, uh, kind of
unusual and then now all of a sudden you know Gorbachev who was, uh, in the U S
-'s pocket pretty much --

A.28:  Yeah. Yeah.

B.29:  -- is now gone you know and now we've got Yeltsin who seems like he's a
little bit of a hard ball, typical.

A.30:  Yeah, but even so, he seems to be a much more reasonable person --

B.31:  Oh, yeah doesn't he?

A.32:  -- than, than you know, previous Soviet leaders.

B.33:  Right, right.  That's true.

A.34:  And, uh, [throat_clearing] you know it's just, uh, you see this, uh, you
know on television.  The, uh, shows on the news --

B.35:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.36:  -- with the people waiting in line.   

B.37:  Uh-huh.

A.38:  They had last night.  I think it was on A B C where some Soviet doctors had
gone on strike --

B.39:  Uh-huh.

A.40:  -- because their, uh, monthly salary was about enough money to buy, um, six
thousand sausage with you know the new increase in prices.

B.41:  Right.

A.42:  Which is, you know, of course, doctors over there aren't held in the same
rare high esteem that they have here in the U S.

B.43:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

A.44:  #But,# 

B.45:  #Well# [throat_clearing] the other thing was, uh, like nuclear scientists
over there were being, uh, taken in by you know other countries you know --

A.46:  Yeah.

B.47:  -- cause I mean like you said, they're not being paid very much over there
and whereas they can command salaries of you know twenty thousand dollars a
month in, uh, you know, these middle eastern countries, that are oil bearing
countries, you know, and I saw that they, uh, Iraq and Iran had offered, uh,
twenty thousand dollars a month to nuclear scientist.

A.48:  Huh.

B.49:  I mean who wouldn't want that kind of money, #you know?#

A.50:  #Yeah, yo-, you know# I would even consider moving to Iraq for that I mean
[laughter].

B.51:  [Laughter].  

A.52:  [Laughter].

B.53:  Yeah really.

A.54:  [Throat_clearing] #Well, anyway it's,#  

B.55:  #And, I mean# these are the guys that couldn't eat, you know.

A.56:  Yeah, yeah.  Well as a matter of fact, I know that, uh, you know they, they
were concerned about the Soviet brain drain because there so many of their top
people just, uh, like you say, the, they you know are being given offers
elsewhere #and# --

B.57:  #Right.#

A.58:  -- and some of them are even coming to the U S --

B.59:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.60:  -- if we can get, um.  You know, rather than let them go to one of those
third world #countries.#

B.61:  #Well# I think the U S is eventually going to have to step in.  I mean
you've got this you know big country that is now, uh, pretty much, uh, in chaos
cause, uh, I mean, the, all the things are split up and they've got a nuclear
arsenal that you know pretty much eliminate the rest of the world and, uh, they
have asked U S support and I think the U S is going to have to give in.

A.62:  Well, I am all for them --

B.63:  Yeah.

A.64:  -- [Throat_clearing] providing as you know, as much support as we can.  At
the same time, you know it's time for us some country to run us, you know, the
rest of the world really is not our responsibility.

B.65:  Uh-huh.

A.66:  It's good for us to look after our own best interests even in, uh, you
know, an international way.

B.67:  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.68:  But at the same time, we, I don't think that we have the resources --

B.69:  Uh-huh.

A.70:  -- to bale out the entire Soviet Union.

B.71:  No, I don't think as far as bale out goes.  I am thinking more on the sense
of, uh, uh, helping them take the intra structure they have and putting it to
use --

A.72:  Yeah.

B.73:  -- and they've got a good intra structure there.  I mean they at one time
were you know they were a threat to the U S.  I mean they had the weapons
ability.  They had the manufacturing capability and I think it's all kind of
disorganized right now.

A.74:  You know the amazing thing that it is but is they seem to have been
operating for you know seventy generations under a, uh, you know the, the
protectorate of the government over them --

B.75:  Right.

A.76:  -- that they really don't even have a concept of what capitalism is.

B.77:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah [laughter].

A.78:  And, and as a matter of fact, I'm not, uh, a guy with my company was in
Moscow several weeks ago --

B.79:  Uh-huh.

A.80:  -- and I asked him what it was like. 

B.81:  Uh-huh.

A.82:  [Inhaling] And he said you know, he said they start drinking vodka at ten
o'clock in the morning.

B.83:  Yeah, yeah [laughter].

A.84:  [Laughter].

B.85:  Yeah, I wish there was that kind of, uh, stuff over here.  It'd be great
[laughter].

A.86:  [Laughter].  

B.87:  #But, uh,# 

A.88:  #But# anyway it's, uh, uh, I don't know there just, they've got a really,
uh, different outlook --

B.89:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.90:  -- and a different mentally that, uh --

B.91:  Uh-huh {very faint}.

A.92:  -- than, uh, people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living,
uh, under any form of capitalism --

B.93:  Yeah.  Yeah.

A.94:  -- and it's going to take quite a while for them to realize that, uh,
