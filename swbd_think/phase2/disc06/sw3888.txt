============================================================================

A.1:  Well how polluted do you think we are down here?  

B.2:  Uh, well, I guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but,  

A.3:  #I think,#

B.4:  #we're out here# on the Great Plains, 

A.5:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.6:  #so there's# some place for it to go.

A.7:  Yeah, I guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's
no specific mountains to hem it in.

B.8:  Yeah.  

A.9:  Uh, we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy
area of Los Angeles, we used to visit down there and honestly you could, you
could see the smog hanging over the city --

B.10:  Yeah.  

A.11:  -- it's just about, uh,

B.12:  I've heard that.  

A.13:  Yes, we can.  And a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino and, uh, uh,
just beyond San Bernardino is the desert and separating San Bernardino from
the desert are some mountain ranges, and when the smog gets very very bad in
Los Angeles, it moves out there and then is bounded by that mountain range,

B.14:  #Uh-huh.# 

A.15:  #and# literally hangs over [laughter] San Bernardino and it's a very, very,

B.16:  #Yeah, I think,# 

A.17:  #strange thing.#

B.18:  that's probably the problem with any of the #coastal,#

A.19:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.20:  cities.  #I think that's,# 

A.21:  #Uh-huh.#

B.22:  what New York has such a problem with.  

A.23:  Yeah.  

B.24:  #You know,# 

A.25:  #Although, you know,# 

B.26:  the, the, the way that the air masses,

A.27:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.#

B.28:  #move around# the, the sea coast --  

A.29:  Uh-huh.  

B.30:  -- uh, and it really just like ((making)) and stuff just hang over
whatever,

A.31:  #Yeah.#

B.32:  #cities# happen to be on the coast.  

A.33:  I, I do think that's what's one of the real problems.  Although I grew up
in New York and I never noticed this kind of,

B.34:  #I don't think it's as bad.# 

A.35:  #pollution,# 

B.36:  #Yeah.# 

A.37:  #as I, I saw,# in, uh, you know, southern California.  

B.38:  #I know there's some,#

A.39:  #And then, uh-huh.#

B.40:  because in my visits, 

A.41:  #Yes, uh-huh.# 

B.42:  #to New York, I noticed# that my, I wear, I'm a contact lens wearer.

A.43:  [Lipsmack]  Oh.  

B.44:  And I noticed that I have to, 

A.45:  #Clean them?#

B.46:  #uh,# take out my contacts.  Yeah, I can't wear them as many hours,

A.47:  #Oh.# 

B.48:  #during the# day as I can other places, 

A.49:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.50:  #but, you know,# I mean that's not just New York.  I mean that's also
Europe.  You know, Rome,

A.51:  #Oh.# 

B.52:  #is the worst# city I've ever been at.  

A.53:  Uh-huh.  

B.54:  Of course, now I hear that, uh, now like Mexico City is real bad for that.

A.55:  Oh, I see.  

B.56:  #And also,#  

A.57:  #Well, I've never# been down there.

B.58:  places in Brazil like Sao Paulo, you know.

A.59:  Is that right?  

B.60:  Yeah.  

A.61:  Well, what are they doing down there that causes such a thing?  What kind
of industries #do they hav-,# 

B.62:  #Well, they have no,# they have no pollution controls whatsoever.

A.63:  I see.  

B.64:  So whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we
have, they just like fire away, you know.

A.65:  I see.  Oh.  

B.66:  They control nothing.  I mean it's like, it's like, you know, the s-, it,
you know, Brazil even though there's, there's in Brazil i-, it's my
understanding because I have some friends there that are Brazilian, uh,
there's an upper class and a lower class and no middle-class.

A.67:  Oh, I see.  Uh-huh.  

B.68:  And so, you know, the lower class is working, uh, in the factories --

A.69:  Uh-huh.  

B.70:  -- which pollute the air, and the upper classes make the money off of,

A.71:  #Oh, I see, uh-huh.  Huh.#  

B.72:  #the factories.#  And so pollution is a big problem,

A.73:  #Huh.#

B.74:  #for# all of the, you know, underdeveloped countries because they're not
going to, they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to
impede their,

A.75:  #Profits, I guess.# 

B.76:  #whatever industry# they happen to have.  

A.77:  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  #Uh-huh.#  

B.78:  #Which,# you know, that's,

A.79:  #Uh-huh.#

B.80:  #kind of# going to be the end result, you know, bu-, I was reading in the
WALL STREET JOURNAL today, you know, Bush's ((moratorial)) on regulatory --

A.81:  Uh-huh.  

B.82:  -- uh, things right now that are going to impede business.  

A.83:  Uh-huh.  

B.84:  The first effect that it has had is the E P A had some new (( )) up --

A.85:  Uh-huh.  

B.86:  -- for, um, congressional approval that had to do with making industries,
uh, itemize, uh, different types of things that they were, you know, putting
into the air, you know, part of the clean air act,

A.87:  #Uh-huh.#

B.88:  #you know,# which is to help enforce the clean air act.  

A.89:  Right.  

B.90:  And so that of course, you know, the moratorium on new regulations has,

A.91:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.92:  #you know,# hamstrung that.  

A.93:  That's right.  Uh-huh.  I, I know that a lot of the European countries and
Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental
regulations, and I think that unless the government is, uh, on top of this or
at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going
to be done by private industry until they, you know, get that,

B.94:  #Absolutely not.#

A.95:  #push.  It really wasn't done# in our country,  

B.96:  #Not any profit driven industry,#

A.97:  #you know, um, uh-huh.  Yeah, uh-huh.#

B.98:  because, you know, they're just absolutely not going to, you know, sit
still for anything that's going to take away from profits.  I mean,

A.99:  #Uh-huh.#

B.100:  #we're,# we're living in the greed generation here.  

A.101:  Uh-huh [laughter]. 

B.102:  I mean there is no, #there is,# 

A.103:  #The greed# generation?  

B.104:  Sure.  I mean, #you know,#

A.105:  #Oh, what a terrible# thing to say.

B.106:  I mean, I've hear-, I've heard that before and I'm now beginning to believe
it,

A.107:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.108:  #because# you know, what I mean I have some limited involvement in some, in
some what you would call I guess environmental type,

A.109:  #Uh-huh.# 

B.110:  #entities.#  I'm an attorney and I,  

A.111:  #Oh, I see.# 

B.112:  #write letters for a number of# environmental, uh --

A.113:  Uh-huh.  

B.114:  -- purposes and, you know, it, it is amazing to me that people can sit here
and look at the situation that we have globally,

A.115:  #Uh-huh.#

B.116:  #and say,# you know, what the hell.  

A.117:  [Lipsmack]  Oh, I know.  

B.118:  Because, 

A.119:  #Um, uh-huh.# 

B.120:  #you know,# it's, it's really apparent to me especially living in a city
the size of Dallas,

A.121:  #Uh-huh, uh-huh.# 

B.122:  #that,# the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why
worry,

A.123:  #Oh.#

B.124:  #you know,# are going away.
